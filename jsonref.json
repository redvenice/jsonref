Trump fired back by calling McCain ‘incompetent’ during a July 2015 rally at the Phoenix Convention Center.The back and forth banter continued for the next two years, as Trump repeatedly launched public attacks – often times on Twitter – at McCain. In a 2016 tweet Trump slammed the senator as ‘foul mouthed’ and in a 2017 post he lashed out at McCain for voting against the Affordable Care Act.‘3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal.

In a July statement, McCain lashed out at the president after Trump said during a meeting in Helsinki with Russian president Vladimir Putin that he accepted Russia’s claim that that they did not meddle in the US presidential election.McCain said of Trump’s comments: ‘No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant’.      Trump was spotted arriving at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, on Sunday morning less than 17 hours after news broke of McCain\u0027s passing"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/26/21/4F6B856300000578-6100485-image-a-2_1535314762042.jpg","title":"Animal liberation activists storm dolphin display Spanish marine theme park","story":"    This is the moment a group of animal liberation activists today stormed a dolphin display          Members of the Vegan Strike Group, an international organisation who claims to fight animal enslavement, disrupted the daily show at Loro Parque, TenerifeWorkers at the side of the arena could be seen calming down dolphins that were in the water ready for their show. Security officers could be seen jumping into the pool and escorting the campaigners from the premises.Last month, travel operator Thomas Cook announced it would stop selling trips to animal parks that kept killer whales.Payday loans giant Wonga is on brink of collapse after surge...Six children, two adults and their dog are killed in a...Share this articleAs such, it planned to cut ties with Loro Parque from next summer after \u0027customer feedback and consultation with animal rights experts\u0027.Writing on Facebook after the display, the Vegan Strike Group said: \u0027For the fourth time our Vegan Strike Group activists have disrupted a dolphin show on Spanish soil.           Workers at the side of the arena could be seen calming down dolphins that were in the water ready for their show          Security officers could be seen jumping into the pool and escorting the campaigners from the premises  A statement from the group said: \u0027The Policia Nacional came to have a look, but Ronny, Renate and Peter were NOT taken to the police station.

To celebrate the birthday of King George III in 1807. Frederick Winsor, an engineer, lit a candle. Not just any candle, however. To gasping crowds, he instantly illuminated a line of gas lamps. Over the following decades, thousands of gas lamps went up across London. These were lit by teams of lamplighters across the capital. With the dawn electricity however, there was no need for lamplighters and the profession died out          A South Eastern Railway platform porter pictured in 1885 in London. Porters arose in the early days of railway companies and would handle passenger\u0027s luggage, assist on ticket barriers and in booking offices and carry out general cleaning duties on the platform. Many porters would work for free, but often customers would provide a tip for their service. During the 1970s the role went into decline as station attendants took on most of the responsibilities.

The industrial revolution led to the mechanised spinning and weaving of cotton fibre into fabric. By 1912 production had peaked in the United Kingdom with the country producing around eight billion yards of cloth. The industry was primarily based in Lancashire with around 2650 mills in the area employing 440,000 people. The outbreak of World War One led to a steep decline in the industry, however. Cotton could no longer be exported to foreign markets and those countries, such as Japan, set up their own factories. These countries were also able to produce it much more cheaply. In between the first and second world war 345,000 workers left the industry and 800 mills closed          A milkman with his cart pictured in 1923 in Norwood, London. During this time milk was delivered up to three times a day in churns. The milkman would fill customers\u0027 jugs by dipping a measure into one of the churns. Milk bottles would soon become the norm however, and later with the advent of refrigerators milk no longer needed to be delivered as frequently.

As with many professions the need for hand-crafted fireworks died out with the invention of more sophisticated machinery  Left: Hop picking in Paddock Wood, Kent. These hop pickers were photographed in 1962. The county was well-known for its hop farming. It has a strong and fertile soil perfect for the growth of hops. In the past, during the hop harvest, tens of thousands of Londoners would take a holiday from London and come down to the Kent countryside to pick the hops. Now machines have largely replaced the task of hop picking. Right: A lift operator pictured on the London Underground in 1910. Being a lift operator was not a simple job. The operator would have to regulate the elevator\u0027s speed and ensure it came to a parallel stop of the chosen floor. With the advent of user-operated elevators, however, their profession largely became obsolete. There are now very few lift operators remaining          Salt workers on a mine train pictured in 1927. Salt was originally mined manually from the ground but in the 19th century it became uneconomical to mine salt. Instead the salt was extracted using water as a solvent.  Hot water was instead pumped through the mines. This would dissolve the salt and create a brine that could be pumped out. Salt would then be extracted from this          A wheelwright at work pictured in 1890. This profession traditionally involved handcrafting or repairing wooden wheels. As time has gone on there has been less of a demand for wooden wheels and therefore less of a demand for wheelwrights          Fletchers pictured making arrows in 1948. The art of fletching traditionally involved adding three half-feathers to the back of an arrow or dart. These would be equally spaced around the circumference of the projectile. Originally this would be done by hand using glue or thread, but now with modern adhesives this is no longer necessary          The sight of children selling newspapers on the streets of London would have been common in the early 1900s. Changing attitudes have led to a decline in thisA lot of times those in one profession could pivot to another. At the beginning of the 20th century for instance, automobiles were putting blacksmiths out of business. Who needed horseshoes anymore? But they soon became mechanics.The middle class is apparently most at risk in the coming technological revolution as computers will be able to perform those tasks more efficiently and at a cheaper cost.According to The Economist, computers will be able to analyse and compare reams of data to make financial decisions or medical ones. There will be less of a chance of fraud or misdiagnosis, and the process will be more efficient. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/26/00/4F6725EF00000578-0-image-a-18_1535238920764.jpg","title":"Vincent van Gogh recognised lifetime work seen French president","story":"Vincent van Gogh, pictured left in a self-portrait with a bandaged ear, had his work viewed by the President of France, a letter from his brother Theo, pictured right, has revealed Theo van Gogh had reportedly visited the Salon des Indépendants exhibition where the French president said the artist\u0027s works were \u0027well placed\u0027 on the walls. Author and curator Martin Bailey, who found the letter, said: \u0027I have long suspected it was a myth that Van Gogh was ignored.Battle of Portaloo: Secret plan to line M20 with portable...Share this article\u0027The Salon des Indepéndants exhibition and the visit by the French president suggests that he was beginning to win some acceptance.\u0027Once one sees Van Gogh as an artist who was beginning to become appreciated, it is easier to understand why his work had such an influence on the artists to come.\u0027           A newly-revealed letter indicates that van Gogh\u0027s work was gaining recognition during his lifetime and was viewed by the President of France (pictured: his work Cypresses)The works on display included \u0027Cypresses\u0027, an 1889 work now held at New York\u0027s Metropolitan Museum of Art.  A report in a Paris newspaper at the time also mentions the French president being impressed with his visit to the exhibition.   Born on March 30, 1853, in Groot-Zundert, Netherlands, van Gogh painted work which was notable for its beauty, emotion and color.His most famous works include Sunflowers, Starry Night, Irises, Bedroom in Arles and his many self-portraits. After struggling with mental illness and poverty throughout his life van Gogh died in France on July 29, 1890 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.He also became well known for allegedly severing his own ear although some historians believe it may have happened during an argument with another artist.  In further correspondence with his brother Theo he said he \u0027loved London\u0027 after spending three years in England as a young trainee art dealer.Van Gogh was not unappreciated in his lifetime, myth-busting letter shows"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/27/12/4F6F230100000578-6102199-image-a-37_1535370859351.jpg","title":"The chippy time stands Traditional fish chip shop uses recipes 1948","story":"    Janet Gillespie (pictured) works at the Upton Fish and Chip Shop which still uses a 66-year old batter recipe is attracting visitors from far and wide to sample its famous secret recipe, which dates back to 1948          Owner Sally Shaw (pictured) still cooks the fish and chips in dripping in a huge coal-fired range, believed to be one of the only two in operation in the UKThe chippy\u0027s owner, 45 year old Sally Shaw, purchased the 70 square foot shop in 2005 during an auction and is still shocked about the success of the business, however is aware that the days of coal-fired ranges are long gone and that many chip shops have now adopted easy ingredients and cooking techniques, which makes her chip shop even more unique.\u0027People will queue all of the way down the street.

Friends of the senator said he wanted the service held at three locations: Arizona, the National Cathedral in Washington and Annapolis, Maryland. Sources said that McCain had requested that George W Bush and Barack Obama deliver the eulogies at his funeral.  Two family members reiterated to CNN on Saturday that Trump won’t be present at the service.    McCain deliberately left Trump off the invite list for the memorial service he and his family have been planning for months, according to sources familiar with the arrangements          The late Arizona senator slammed the president on Twitter last month, calling his performance at the Helsinki Summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin \u0027disappointing, yet not surprising\u0027Trump and McCain’s bad blood stems back to June 2015 when Trump announced he was running for president and called Mexican immigrants ‘rapists’ and drug runners during a speech.McCain distanced himself from the future-president saying in an interview that he disagreed with Trump’s comment. Trump fired back by calling McCain ‘incompetent’ during a July 2015 rally at the Phoenix Convention Center.The back and forth banter continued for the next two years, as Trump repeatedly launched public attacks – often times on Twitter – at McCain. In a 2016 tweet Trump slammed the senator as ‘foul mouthed’ and in a 2017 post he lashed out at McCain for voting against the Affordable Care Act.‘3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning, let ObamaCare implode, then deal. Watch!’ he wrote.At one point during the two politician’s bitter feud, Trump mocked McCain’s record as a prisoner of war during the Vietnam War saying that McCain was only labeled a hero ‘because he was captured’ and he liked ‘people that weren’t captured’.For his part, McCain publicly criticized Trump on numerous occasions. In a July statement, McCain lashed out at the president after Trump said during a meeting in Helsinki with Russian president Vladimir Putin that he accepted Russia’s claim that that they did not meddle in the US presidential election.McCain said of Trump’s comments: ‘No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant’.      Trump was spotted arriving at Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, on Sunday morning less than 17 hours after news broke of McCain\u0027s passing"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/26/21/4F6B856300000578-6100485-image-a-2_1535314762042.jpg","title":"Animal liberation activists storm dolphin display Spanish marine theme park","story":"    This is the moment a group of animal liberation activists today stormed a dolphin display          Members of the Vegan Strike Group, an international organisation who claims to fight animal enslavement, disrupted the daily show at Loro Parque, TenerifeWorkers at the side of the arena could be seen calming down dolphins that were in the water ready for their show. Security officers could be seen jumping into the pool and escorting the campaigners from the premises.Last month, travel operator Thomas Cook announced it would stop selling trips to animal parks that kept killer whales.Payday loans giant Wonga is on brink of collapse after surge...Six children, two adults and their dog are killed in a...Share this articleAs such, it planned to cut ties with Loro Parque from next summer after \u0027customer feedback and consultation with animal rights experts\u0027.Writing on Facebook after the display, the Vegan Strike Group said: \u0027For the fourth time our Vegan Strike Group activists have disrupted a dolphin show on Spanish soil.           Workers at the side of the arena could be seen calming down dolphins that were in the water ready for their show          Security officers could be seen jumping into the pool and escorting the campaigners from the premises  A statement from the group said: \u0027The Policia Nacional came to have a look, but Ronny, Renate and Peter were NOT taken to the police station.

Cue millions of drinkers choking with horror on their sauvignon blanc.As one of the thirstiest nations in the world, the British have long clung to the received wisdom that moderate drinking brings some health benefits. But it’s now become impossible to ignore that the health benefits of alcohol are utterly dwarfed by the drawbacks. Almost five years ago, I realised that my bottle-of-wine a night habit was stamping all over my relationships, career and wellbeing in the manner of King Kong crashing through a city. So I quit, completely. Not without absolute dread, mind. I felt like I was pawning a bejewelled party dress to get money to pay the gas bill, or selling a Porsche to put into a pension. I knew it was sensible for me to stop, but did I want to do it? Hell no.So I was astonished to discover how much happier I became, and how much more my family and friends liked me. Sobriety is portrayed as social suicide. We are told – we tell each other – that alcohol is the bottle-shaped root of all fun, bonding, romance and relaxation. Phrases like “stone-cold sober” and “sober as a judge” hammer home the stern, preachy reputation of sobriety. But sober really doesn’t feel like that.I no longer stay out until 3am shouting at people I barely know, repeating myself, before getting stuck into some questionable chicken like a coyote. I don’t have terrifying rips in my memory where the end of the night should be, nor do I drag myself through the next day fantasising about being hit by a bus so that I can go where I feel like going – hospital.Drinking has a beautiful side, as well as a beastly one, of course. But then every drug has positives. MDMA made me dance like a lunatic for five hours straight and told me I loved everyone I did acid once and had a fascinating conversation with a hand towel when I did cocaine I felt like the hot damn Mistress of the Universe.Recreational drugs drop a veil over reality, they do a sexy belly dance in your brain you do mad, spontaneous things, then in the morning you pick up the agonising tab. The flipside of MDMA was a week-long serotonin ennui, microdots convinced me that a woman on the nightbus was an assassin, and I may have felt silken and charming on coke, but everyone else thought I was an arrogant wazzock. None of those drugs were worth the price tag. They were too expensive, both psychologically and physically, for me.Alcohol is no different. It has its pros and it has its crashing lows. Alcohol allows you to segue swiftly from clenched to chilled, by sliding down the fast-route wine waterslide. Whoosh. You’re there. But are the lows worth the highs? For me, they weren’t. And a fifth of British adults think similarily, since they’re also teetotal, according to the latest Office for National Statistics figures.Drinking alcohol for health benefits is like eating burgers for the gherkins. Anyone still imbibing under this delusion needs to remove their head from the sandpit in the pub garden.Surely we already knew this, on an atomic level, that even a small amount of alcohol screws with our body and mental health? Even when I managed to keep my pub tab to just two drinks, the next day I still felt the smudge of tiredness, the scratch of anxiety, the roil of nausea, the ghost of sadness. Our body tells us that it hates even titchy amounts of booze, if we would only listen we don’t really need a report to tell us.As a nation, we are terrified to loosen our grip on alcohol as our social lubricant. I get it. But there truly is nothing to lose other than the crucifying hangovers the ability to laugh at jokes that aren’t funny propensity to pull people you don’t fancy and the inclination to stay out beyond 1am (after which nothing good happens, I promise, having done my research on 16,807 occasions). The only – yes, only! – social skill I have lost is the ability to do karaoke.And believe me, the world can live without that. • Catherine Gray is the author of The Unexpected Joy of Being Sober"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4cf5a630ddca74601cb326bc8163c65abf9c9362/0_142_3851_2311/master/3851.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0b73e25c09f0f46026189fcc398e4eee","title":"air pollution causes huge reduction in intelligence study reveals","story":"Impact of high levels of toxic air ‘is equivalent to having lost a year of education’Air pollution causes a “huge” reduction in intelligence, according to new research, indicating that the damage to society of toxic air is far deeper than the well-known impacts on physical health.Previous research has found that air pollution harms cognitive performance in students, but this is the first to examine people of all ages and the difference between men and women.The damage in intelligence was worst for those over 64 years old, with serious consequences, said Chen: “We usually make the most critical financial decisions in old age.” Rebecca Daniels, from the UK public health charity Medact, said: “This report’s findings are extremely worrying.”Air pollution causes seven million premature deaths a year but the harm to people’s mental abilities is less well known. A recent study found toxic air was linked to “extremely high mortality” in people with mental disorders and earlier work linked it to increased mental illness in children, while another analysis found those living near busy roads had an increased risk of dementia.The new work, published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, analysed language and arithmetic tests conducted as part of the China Family Panel Studies on 20,000 people across the nation between 2010 and 2014. The scientists compared the test results with records of nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide pollution.They found the longer people were exposed to dirty air, the bigger the damage to intelligence, with language ability more harmed than mathematical ability and men more harmed than women. The researchers said this may result from differences in how male and female brains work.Derrick Ho, at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said the impact of air pollution on cognition was important and his group had similar preliminary findings in their work. “It is because high air pollution can potentially be associated with oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration of humans,” he said.Chen said air pollution was most likely to be the cause of the loss of intelligence, rather than simply being a correlation. The study followed the same iniduals as air pollution varied from one year to the next, meaning that many other possible causal factors such as genetic differences are automatically accounted for.The scientists also accounted for the gradual decline in cognition seen as people age and ruled out people being more impatient or uncooperative during tests when pollution was high.Air pollution was seen to have a short-term impact on intelligence as well and Chen said this could have important consequences, for example for students who have to take crucial entrance exams on polluted days.“But there is no shortcut to solve this issue,” he said. “Governments really need to take concrete measures to reduce air pollution. That may benefit human capital, which is one of the most important driving forces of economic growth.” In China, air pollution is declining but remains three times above World Health Organisation (WHO) limits.According to the WHO, 20 of the world’s most polluted cities are in developing countries. China, home to several of those cities, has been engaged in a “war against pollution” for the past five years.The results would apply around the world, Chen added. The damage to intelligence was likely to be incremental, he said, with a 1mg rise in pollution over three years equivalent to losing more than a month of education. Small pollution particles are known to be especially damaging. “That is the same wherever you live. As human beings we have more in common than is different.”Aarash Saleh, a registrar in respiratory medicine in the UK and part of the Doctors Against Diesel campaign, said: “This study adds to the concerning bank of evidence showing that exposure to air pollution can worsen our cognitive function. Road traffic is the biggest contributor to air pollution in residential areas and the government needs to act urgently to remove heavily-polluting vehicles from our roads.”Daniels said: “The UK’s air is illegally polluted and is harming people’s health every day. Current policies are not up to the scale of the challenge: government must commit to bringing air pollution below legal limits as soon as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca24ee1a88429bebd66f501445d7b80ec1273a0f/0_1146_2832_1699/master/2832.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4470252ce0c3e2388b5d9b012adfaa5","title":"uk summer wind drought puts green revolution into reverse","story":"Windfarms fall short in heatwave, but 2018 was still UK’s second greenest summerBritain’s long heatwave threw the country’s green energy revolution into reverse and pushed up carbon emissions this summer, leading experts to stress the need for a erse energy mix. The summer of 2017 was lauded as the “greenest ever” for electricity generation, thanks to a growing number of windfarms and solar installations edging out coal and gas power stations.But this year has seen a comparatively dirty summer for power generation, due to the weather’s impact on renewables. The Met Office said the high pressure that caused much of the country to bask under sunny skies had suppressed windy conditions.The weather proved a boon for staycations, garden centres and solar panel owners, but windfarms suffered. They usually provide four times as much power as solar each year. The wind drought meant that at times turbine blades sat idle for days. Although record-breaking solar output helped fill some of the gap and nuclear plants provided a bedrock of supply, gas power stations were fired up to meet demand. Duncan Burt, director of operations at National Grid, said: “We have seen a slight decrease in wind over the summer linked to the unusually warm weather, which demonstrates why it is important for us to have a erse energy mix to ensure we can continue to manage supply and demand.”He welcomed the growth in wind and solar over the past year, and said both were playing an increasingly important role in the energy system.While this summer showed an uptick in carbon emissions, it is the second greenest ever.And looking beyond the summer, carbon intensity for the year fell to a record low in the first eight months. Windy conditions and new windfarms boosted wind energy during the winter, and coal use has fallen to new lows despite a brief resurgence during the “beast from the east”. RenewableUK, the wind power industry body, said wind had “become a mainstream power source”.A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: “We’re investing up to £2.5bn in low-carbon innovation and are already seeing the results.”Analysts have told renewable energy investors not to be alarmed about the lack of wind this summer.After examining 17 years of monthly wind speeds in the UK, Bernstein bank concluded: “We do not find any evidence of a structural trend in wind speed over time.”Experts also said that the way solar highs coincided with wind lows showed that both technologies were needed in the switch to green energy. Wind power generation is well ahead of solar in Europe.Pascal Storck, director of renewable energy at environmental measurement firm Vaisala, said: “Often wind and solar technologies are played against each other, but the reality is that a erse portfolio … will be the solution to long-term variability of this nature.”Can batteries plug the gap when it’s not windy or sunny?Not yet. Utility-scale batteries have been installed around the UK’s electricity grid, and more are being built now. But these are mostly used for last-minute adjustments to keep power supply and demand in balance, in order to keep the frequency of electricity at 50Hz. For the most part, economics and technology mean it does not yet make sense to store surplus green energy from one day to use on another."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e740212f336d4e14eca2594bc2730ddd7c430e2/541_128_4453_2671/master/4453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0185181c24567fc6b66f730d790ee00","title":"la vie en rose nows the time to rethink pink in pictures","story":"Pink just grew up.

I still have to concentrate when I say it though – med-zay man-e-kay – which, typed here, seems as much a name for a rapper as a dried pasta shape. Half the length of another favourite – tubular, ridged rigatoni – the short sleeves of mezze maniche, with their five-pence diameter, are just the thing for catching and hiding chunks: a cube of pancetta, a tip of asparagus, a bit of broccoli floret, a chunk of fried aubergine.It is chunks of aubergine, also courgette, red pepper and mozzarella, hiding for this week’s recipe: pasta di mezz’estate, or midsummer pasta. It could just as easily be called middle-of-the-summer-holidays, late August or early September pasta, given the summer we have all shared and the subsequent abundance of summer vegetables that looks set to roll on.I take an almost perverse pleasure in frying when the weather is hot, in the layers of heat and stream of sweat, a habit possibly begun when we fried an egg on the bonnet of Dad’s Rover 100 in 1989. Alternatively, you could roast the diced vegetables in the oven just be generous with the oil and salt. The parmesan acts much the same way as with tagliatelle and rich bolognese sauce, a sort of culinary glue, melting and melding everything together.The idea of there being pasta shapesauce rules or official combinations is mismatched with the anarchic joy of food, especially if it is used as a sort of one-upmanship. But there is tradition – pairings that work or have been repeated so often they have taken root: a tangle of spaghetti with clams, corkscrew twists of trofie for pesto, a tube of macaroni, rigatoni or mezze maniche for concealing pieces of aubergine and mozzarella. There is also what you like and have in the cupboard.Whatever pasta you use, pasta di mezz’estate with its glistening vegetables, tomato sheen, melting mozzarella, all united by parmesan and reeking of basil, is a gorgeous, generous dish for a crowd, especially on a warm day, when sunny flavours are called for – saladwatermelongranita and other icy jolts can come after.1 large aubergine1 red pepper2 courgettesOlive or vegetable oil, for frying2 large ripe tomatoes4 tbsp olive oil1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed100g parmesan, grated100g mozzarella, dicedRipped leaves from 1 big sprig of basil500g pasta: penne, mezze maniche, fusilliBring a large pan of water to a boil for the pasta. Dice the aubergine, pepper and courgette into 1cm cubes. Pour enough oil into a deep, medium-sized frying pan for it to come an inch up the sides and heat until hot. Working in batches, fry the diced vegetables in the oil until soft and golden, then blot on kitchen towel and keep warm. Tip the oil from the pan.Plunge the tomatoes into the almost boiling water for a minute, lift out with a slotted spoon then refresh under cold water, at which point the skins should slip off. Roughly chop the tomatoes.Put the frying pan back on the heat with four tablespoons of new oil and the garlic. Once the garlic is fragrant, add the chopped tomatoes and cook until soft and saucy – about 10 minutes.Once the water is boiling, add salt, stir, then add the pasta and cook until al dente. Once the pasta is ready, drain and tip into the tomato pan and toss.Tip the pasta and sauce into a large bowl, add the fried vegetables, parmesan, mozzarella and ripped basil, toss thoroughly and serve.

Antonio Valencia has been booked for clattering into Alli.57 min: Victor Lindelof is going to come on for United soon. Phil Jones has a hamstring problem.55 min: Manchester United make their first change, Alexis Sanchez replacing Ander Herrera.54 min: Tottenham are rampant! Now Alli surges through the middle and almost bursts clear after combining with Moura, only for Smalling to deny him in the nick of time. The locals are restless.Kieran Trippier plays another pass down the line to Christian Eriksen, who’s played onside by Ander Herrera in the middle. Eriksen has the presence of mind to pick out the onrushing Lucas Moura, who has the desire to charge on to the ball and skim a drive into the bottom-right corner from 12 yards. That is a lovely goal and Manchester United are in big trouble now.51 min: United look for an instant reponse, but Lukaku sees his curving drive pushed away by Lloris after bustling through. Rose manages to hook the loose ball clear.A corner to Tottenham on the right. Kieran Trippier swings it in and Harry Kane levers Phil Jones aside before guiding a sumptuous header into the top-left corner, leaving De Gea rooted to the spot. It’s the first time Tottenham have scored at Old Trafford under Mauricio Pochettino!Harry Kane has his first goal at Old Trafford!49 min: Tottenham’s passing has been appalling at times. But this is better. Eriksen escapes down the right and clips the ball back to Alli, who sees his low shot deflected wide by Smalling.47 min: Alli spins adroitly and makes towards United’s area. He feeds Kane on the left and the striker tries to find Moura at the far post. It isn’t a great cross, but De Gea es down to meet it and almost pushes it on to Moura’s head. With his goal unguarded, United’s goalkeeper is relieved to see the ball loop over the Brazilian’s leap. 46 min: Tottenham get the second half underway. They take 30 seconds to lose the ball, allowing United to attack. Shaw raids down the left again and knocks a pass inside to Pogba, who swings a decent shot just wide from 25 yards. “Fascinating duel between Pogba and Alli to see just who can waste more possession in a single half of football,” Christopher Faherty says. “Alli with the more decisive misses, Pogba the more habitual and careless offender. We eagerly await the second half.”Manchester United have had the better chances and most of the play, but Tottenham will feel aggrieved not to have been awarded a penalty for Phil Jones’s push on Lucas Moura. Overall it’s been a weird, ragged game, with neither side particularly impressive.45 min: There will be one more minute of this scrappiness.42 min: Surrounded by three Spurs players, Pogba knocks a five-yard pass out of play before remonstrating with Valencia for failing to support him. Moments later Alderweireld launches a long ball towards Moura. The ball floats over the Brazilian and falls to Alli on the left. He takes a touch and looks certain to score, only for Herrera to throw himself in front of the England midfielder’s shot.40 min: Vertonghen hoicks a long ball into the area. Kane’s presence leads to the ball dropping to Moura, who seems surprised when it reaches him. His miscontrol runs back to Eriksen, who sees his tame low shot from 18 yards saved by De Gea.39 min: Mousa Dembele has been an issue for Spurs tonight. He’s been slow on the ball, which has stopped Spurs from building any rhythm, and his passing’s been poor. This is a player who was expected to leave Spurs at the start of the summer.36 min: “I am as astonished as you that that clear penalty was not called,” JR in Illinois says. “Would you be more astonished to know that Lee Dixon didn’t think it was a penalty? Absolutely ridiculous. Spurs don’t deserve to be leading this game but they still should be.”35 min: Harry Kane appears to have decided he’s a midfielder.34 min: More United pressure. Fred tees up Pogba, who bends a low shot towards the left corner from 20 yards. Lloris pushes it away. The ball comes to Valencia and the right-back’s cross hits Vertonghen, who’s relieved to see it spin inches past the near post. 31 min: I’ve now seen that clumsy barge from Jones on Moura three or four times and I am astonished that Tottenham were not awarded a penalty.30 min: Fred, who’s been impressive so far, bends a shot just past the far post from the right of Tottenham’s area.29 min: Lucas Moura suddenly injects some urgency into Tottenham’s attack, speeding in from the right and using his strength to excellent effect. He bursts into the area and falls when Jones barges into him from behind. Craig Pawson waves Tottenham’s appeals away. It was a clear penalty. A pathetic decision from the referee."},{"url":null,"title":"why i came out as being poor","story":"Publicly admitting my struggle perpetuated the feeling that I was undeserving of most things – but anyone could find themselves in a similar situationFor nearly a decade, I thought it was obvious that I was poor.Cashiers saw me and knew, without asking, that I’d pay for my groceries with food stamps. My car was always the oldest in the parking lot when I brought my daughter to ballet classes – the family there by scholarship, by the good graces of the owners. I sat on the entryway benches with all the other moms, listening to them complain about their husbands working so much. “I’m practically a single mom,” they’d say, exasperated. I clenched my jaw and stared at the floor. Every Friday afternoon my kindergartener’s backpack was filled with free food for the weekend. The local parent-teacher association always had an in-depth discussion over what to include. I didn’t tell them that I knew, firsthand, that the granola bars were inedible I didn’t want to make the other parents uncomfortable knowing there was a “food bag” recipient in the room. That fear of being singled out never left me I wore it like a weighted vest. I felt the stigma of poverty every hour, even in my own home, but I never admitted to friends how desperate my situation was. I stared potential landlords down with a seven-year-old standing next to me and a baby on my hip, asking to apply for a tiny studio apartment I could barely afford. I spoke to a dozen secretaries at local churches, asking if they had funds to help me pay for childcare. I went hungry and bounced checks to order pizza for dinner. Struggling to take care of my daughter on my own, I needed whatever government assistance I qualified for – a few hundred bucks a month in food stamps, free school lunches, childcare vouchers and coupons for milk and cheese – while I simultaneously worked as a maid, juggling 10 clients between going to class to put myself through college. Very few of my friends knew. They didn’t know the work I put into finding these resources – hours on the phone, standing in line, handing over thick packets to prove my need.These food stamps, coupons and vouchers were not resources the public deemed vital to my survival. They were handouts, donations – alms. We call aid programs “entitlements” but, for those who depend on them, they feel less like rights and more like privileges given, or yanked away, at the caprices of a cold and unsympathetic state. The hours I spent applying for food stamps, Medicaid and childcare vouchers became akin to begging. When I saw the letter of acceptance for Snap – the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, popularly known as food stamps – it was a moment of gratitude, and brief catharsis and relief. Still, I knew it wasn’t a socially acceptable means to feed my family with. I saw the memes friends posted, chastising people on welfare. One friend who worked as a grocery store clerk (paid $7.25 an hour and unchanged since 2009) took it upon herself to list the junk food people bought with their Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) cards, the debit cards used to pay with food stamps: “Funyuns? On food stamps? Really?”Meanwhile, another acquaintance shared a letter to the editor written by a man proclaiming that people on food stamps should be sterilized and given bags of beans, rice and powdered milk.Eventually, I made my way out of poverty.After I sank deep into debt to get a bachelor’s degree in English, I stubbornly held myself accountable to it. Maybe because I felt obtaining a higher education was a privilege I couldn’t afford, and that the debt affected not only my future, but my daughters’. This hindsight made me work harder than ever, late into the night, from home and with a baby sleeping on my lap. Gone were the days of cleaning houses. I put my degree to as much work as possible as a freelance writer. Even if it meant filling content for a local events calendar, technically I was getting paid to write words. These gigs gradually grew into ones with paychecks bigger than I’d had in years. I carried myself like a professional, even stood a little taller. Cashiers didn’t assume I would pay with food stamps as much anymore, but those days burned bright in my memory. I began to think that, maybe if I wrote pieces about the battles people in poverty face, it would cause others to share their stories.The prospect of publicly admitting my economic struggle to make ends meet meant gnawing on my fingernails the morning an article was published. By disclosing that I needed government assistance, I thought I’d open myself up to scrutiny in every social interaction. Now it felt as if there was a “welfare” label hanging over me, flashing like a neon sign. Would my friends judge me for joining them for lunch? If they saw me out on a rare dinner date? Would I be chastised for wasting money on a babysitter? I felt like what most people considered self-care was, for me, indulgent and even selfish.Seeing my words – “I’m on food stamps” – out there for everyone to read made me sink a little into the floor. “Serves you right for getting an English degree,” one commenter remarked. But he just read this in a nationally respected publication, I thought. Still, the comments perpetuated the feeling that I was undeserving of most things, even a college education. Most people don’t see themselves as sitting on that bottom rung as a defense mechanism. The more they blame poor people for their poverty, the further they feel from being in the same place. Even the working poor who qualify for food, childcare and housing benefits don’t see themselves as such. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps! They see their situation as temporary. This creates a boundary around what people will do, how much they are willing to swallow their pride, to ask for help. Some might borrow money from family, or ask to move their wife and children into an apartment over their parents’ garage. Others will ask friends for donations or their church congregations for offerings. But some, like me, didn’t have this cushion under them, and I think it’s hard for people to realize how much that invisible place to land is a huge privilege when you find yourself falling into depths you weren’t able to plan for. Anyone could get laid off anyone could have their hours cut, and feel their stomach lurch as they watch their wages drop anyone could encounter a medical emergency that clears their life’s savings in a matter of weeks and leaves them with punishing debt. After publishing that first article, a surprising amount of comments and messages came from others who admitted to the same feeling of living life over a great chasm with only a wobbly suspension bridge to keep you from falling. They admitted to the same head-spinning fear of any movement, any upset, any wrong step could plunge one’s foot between the slats of the bridge. For people in poverty, every day is like that. Yet they are expected to live this way while being told to work harder. What they need to hear instead is: “It’s okay to sit down for a second, you deserve some rest.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/47a0082deec05d5044877a3c6c056df7670a04d4/0_0_1960_1180/master/1960.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ab1d5c18036e12c668799fa9229ccbaf","title":"greece in 10 audiobooks a listeners literary guide","story":"Myths, magic and mandolins feature in these stories about one of Europe’s oldest and grandest culturesIf you’re planning a summer vacation to Greece, the good news is it’s hard to get it wrong. From the stunning coastlines of Crete, to the lively festivals of Thessaloniki and the sacred sites of Delphi, the country combines beautiful landscapes with rich mythology and literature. Go on a sunset wine tour beside the bright-blue seas and domes of Santorini, believed to have been the home of the mythical land of Atlantis. Or visit Delos, where Apollo, the god of poetry, truth and prophecy, is said to have been born. Travel to one of the world’s largest natural harbours in Ithaca and you’ll see why Odysseus is intent on returning here in Homer’s Odyssey. Literature is inescapable in Greece. Athens offers its own tour of the spots where writers from all over the world once spent their time keen cyclists can take a three-hour bike tour around historic Athens and Plaka. Families with teens can be led around the city by a street-art expert, exploring the graffiti and urban art of a thriving creative scene. And if it’s great food you’re after, why limit yourself to eating when you can learn how to make it too? Join one of the city’s cooking lessons designed to give tourists a chance to recreate seven traditional Greek dishes, before heading home with a recipe book.If you’re in the market for a lazy holiday of sun, sand and sea, Crete could be the place for you. With its secluded bays and pink-sand beaches, Greece’s largest island is stunning and hospitable. Elounda is perhaps the fanciest part – a good spot if you’ve got a bit of cash to spend, or for the honeymooners. Alternatively, you could take the heart-stopping drive through narrow roads on steep cliffs to Stefanou Beach, an incredible cove of turquoise water. Elafonisi Beach is the place for pastel-pink sand. It is near a national park where tourists are known to come and do a five-hour hike through the gorge. Nature lovers might also enjoy Pátmos, designated as the “Holy Island” of Greece. Its settlement, Chorá, is a world heritage site, where white houses sparkle under the Aegean sun between historical streets leading from the island’s port, Skála, to the famous monastery. This is where John the Apostle wrote the Book of Revelation, having been banished to Pátmos by the Roman authorities. Ultimately, Greece’s extraordinary literary legacy is evident almost everywhere you look. Whether you’re exploring the inner cities or taking time out on the beach, a holiday in Greece is a great chance to familiarise yourself with the abundance of literature written about this ancient, mythical and beautiful country. And you might want to start with any number of the audiobooks listed below, perfect for listeners heading there this summer.The Magus by John Fowles, NaxosNicholas Urfe is a young Brit teaching English on a fictional Greek island, based on Spetses. Bored and consumed by his loneliness, he stumbles on to a wealthy estate and its Greek owner, Maurice Conchis, a man who may have collaborated with the Nazis. The two develop a friendship, and Nicholas is drawn into Conchis’s mysterious ways and psychological games, becoming a performer in re-enactments of the Nazi occupation and obscene parodies of Greek mythology. This is a chilling thriller, as well as a postmodern classic, in which the narrator, Nicholas, grows unsure of what is real. Many of its settings exist, however. The Lord Byron School, where Nicholas teaches, is the Anargyrios and Korgialenios School of Spetses, and Villa Bourani is a private house on the south side of the island, overlooking a popular public beach.The Names by Don DeLillo, MacmillanDeLillo knows how to write a dense and elusive novel. And he doesn’t miss the mark in this tale about the mythological world. The characters are bizarre, yet well realised, and the author uses their story to look at family loss and language. It’s classic DeLillo, in so far as all the players are smart and eloquent, including the children, and it is stylish throughout – much more than just your average exotic thriller. Set in Athens, this is a story that moves away from conventional plot to focus on politics, culture, religion and mythology.Murder in Mykonos by Jeffrey Siger, HachetteWhen a backpacker goes missing on the island of Mykonos, no one is sure if it is her body that is found in the ancient church. Andreas Kaldis, the new chief of police, recently arrived from Athens, is faced with an island of locals who are used to doing things their own way. The case reminds him, and veteran homicide investigator Tassos Stamatos, of the ritualistic murders of a few years ago, but the suspect has since killed himself. So who could the killer be? The book reveals its author’s intimate knowledge of Mykonos, with very visual descriptions and lots of information about the historic churches. Perhaps it’s no surprise this was a bestseller in Greece.Exit West by Mohsin Hamid, PenguinIn the newest novel by the author of The Reluctant Fundamentalist and How to Get Filthy Rich in Rising Asia, Hamid tells a story about migration, in which the refugee journey happens through a portal. While living in an unnamed country taken over by war, Nadia and Saeed hear of “doors that could take you elsewhere, often to places far away”. The couple pass through a portal and find that they are on the Greek island of Mykonos, in a refugee camp. Here, “everyone was foreign, and so, in a sense, no one was”. Exit West is a timely tale about the global refugee crisis, much of which Greece has witnessed first hand. This modern history of the country is just as compelling as its mythology.Captain Corelli’s Mandolin by Louis de Bernières, AudibleSet on the Greek island of Kefalonia, the novel follows Antonio Corelli, an Italian army captain who comes to the island in the early days of the second world war. Corelli begins a love affair with Pelagia, the daughter of local doctor Iannis. Their relationship is complicated, as is to be expected in wartime, and atrocities mount around them, in both their personal lives and the life of the island itself. This is a love story and a war story – a tale of an island that is occupied first by the Italians, then the Germans. The characters are gloriously rendered and Captain Corelli’s Mandolin uses its magical setting to tell a now-famous story about romance and courage.Shirley Valentine by Willy Russell, Laughing StockYou’ve probably seen the film, adapted from the play of the same name. Shirley is a lonely middle-aged Liverpudlian woman in a loveless marriage. When her friend offers to take her on holiday to Greece, she packs her bags and heads for the sun. The gorgeous island of Mykonos is a strong attraction for both tourists and, seemingly, many of the writers who go there. And it’s the same for Shirley, who rediscovers herself here, along with the happiness she’s been longing for. Hers is a story of finding self-confidence, and recognising it’s never too late to start again.Zorba the Greek by Nikos Kazantzakis, Recorded BooksMaybe you’ve seen the film too? Written by Cretan Kazantzakis, the novel tells the story of a Greek intellectual who befriends working man Alexis Zorba. Zorba is a larger than life and unpredictable, unlike the narrator, who is modest and reserved. The two become friends, and the passion in Zorba’s character reminds both narrator and reader of the joys of living. Set in Crete, the tale captures the island’s passionate spirit – full of its smells, tastes and wines.The Song of Achilles by Madeline Miller, IsisThis is The Iliad skilfully told from another perspective. Writing from the point of view of Achilles’s best friend, Patroclus, Madeline Miller convincingly reimagines the relationship as a romance, casting a different light on the Trojan War. Achilles is given a human touch. He is gentle and capable of love. It’s a new side to an ancient story and it’s super smart. The men are not positioned as brothers in arms, but as the soul mates that Homer hints they might be. Greece’s wealth of mythological and classical literature is complemented by this masterful modern interpretation.My Family and Other Animals by Gerald Durrell, AudibleThis autobiographical work tells the story of British zookeeper, conservationist and TV presenter Gerald Durrell’s childhood on the Greek island of Corfu, where he discovered his interest in the natural world. Home-schooled during this period, Durrell became friends with a Greek doctor, Theodore Stephanides, who acted as a mentor to the boy and kindled his fascination with local fauna. The book is as much about the author’s family experiences as it is about Corfu. “It was originally intended to be a mildly nostalgic account of the natural history of the island,” wrote Durrell, “but I made a grave mistake by introducing my family into the book in the first few pages.” My Family and Other Animals is as charming as it is full of sunny olive groves and cypress trees, and all the more enjoyable for it.Mythos by Stephen Fry, PenguinAncient Greek literature has inspired creators from Shakespeare to Walt Disney. The Greek myths are told to you here by the ever-soothing voice of Stephen Fry, who takes you from Zeus to Athena with his typical humour. The Greek gods of the past become relatable, as pop culture, modern literature and music are woven into their stories. It is joyfully informal, yet full of the literary legacy threaded through so much of the tapestry of contemporary Greece.Your first audiobook is free with a 30-day trial from Audible – £7.99 a month after 30 days.

Beveridge added that hefty stamp duty charges were also pushing second-movers out of the capital. “More people are making a bigger move and buying a larger home sooner to avoid having to pay stamp duty on additional moves as they trade up. For many, this means heading further north.”The average stamp duty bill for buying a detached home in the south is £14,780, compared with £5,358 in the north, Hamptons said.Most Londoners selling up move to the home counties, but the proportion going further afield has risen markedly in recent years. In 2008 one in 17 headed to the north or Midlands, but now the figure is one in five.Hamptons said the typical London leaver buying in the south-west of England paid nearly £550,000 for a home. It said moves to the south-west were not just about retirement, with evidence that many people are commuting long-distance back to the capital, often staying in London for a few days a week.In some towns, such as Hastings, the surge in Londoners  is blamed for pushing up prices to levels that local residents cannot afford and creating gentrified enclaves.However, that was a slight improvement on last year, with the help-to-buy scheme assisting some purchasers. “But even though more Londoners are buying their first home in the capital than last year, more are being priced out of the south altogether,” Hamptons said.Richard Donnell of Hometrack, said: “The fact house prices in some of our biggest cities are still recovering from the financial crisis shows how big an impact it had on the UK’s regional housing markets.“While 2008 was the year when house prices fell at their fastest rate, they continued to fall for a further three to four years in the weaker performing markets as the impact of the recession and restricted credit availability hit the value of people’s homes.”• This article was amended on 27 August 2018 to clarify that there is a record proportion, not a record number, of Londoners selling their homes and moving north."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c4f81ecf351f7413f87b5bd03ff6354b374c0ca/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e2b288d51b9af446566e6eb69f9ad39","title":"reading leeds festival review most diverse lineup yet","story":"Bramham Park, LeedsFrom Dua Lipa’s choreographed pop to Kendrick Lamar’s rap blitzkrieg, R\u0026ampL expanded beyond the indie faithful – but Sex on Fire still got the biggest singalong‘The worst lineup ever” raged social-media users when this year’s twin-site festival was announced in February, while a recent tweet unfavourably comparing the event with that of 2000 (Oasis, Pulp, Primal Scream, et al) went viral.However, the former rock festival had to adapt to changing tastes. Huge, anthemic indie rock bands – the Vaccines and the Courteeners – still fill the field, but there are far fewer of them. This year’s event is the most culturally erse yet, with rock, metal, rap, grime, dance and pop represented across seven stages. Some things don’t change, though, and the traditional post-GCSE results blowout attracts a largely teenage audience seizing the opportunity to paint their faces with glitter and try things they wouldn’t dare at home. When rapper Post Malone urges “Get drunk! Do drugs!” you can almost hear the distant wails of irate parents.If the vibe is still mostly good-natured fun, acts as erse as rabble rousers Shame and exuberant brass-sectioned popsters Get Cape, Wear Cape, Fly make political statements, and post-hardcore band Petrol Girls’ singer Ren Aldridge’s startling screams of “Touch me and I’ll fucking kill you” bring #MeToo fury to the Pit tent.After criticism over the lack of female artists, women are finally featuring more prominently. Norwich’s Let’s Eat Grandma mix sublime, airy electro pop with charmingly bonkers dance moves. Stylishly-suited Ellie Rowsell leads Wolf Alice’s terrific mix of ethereality, hard riffola and a dash of funk with poise and confidence, while Dua Lipa’s choreographed pop gets the Sunday main stage crowd singing in the rain. Dance music is strong this year, and the beat-pumping Bicep pack the tent so tightly that latecomers might as well tunnel their way in. Although mediocrity s all stages, there are some surprises. Linkin Park’s Mike Shinoda’s set becomes an emotional tribute to that band’s late singer, Chester Bennington, and the weekend’s unlikely smash is the reinvention of the Wombats from indie has-beens into a slick, synthesiser-augmented, funny pop machine. For Let’s Dance to Joy Division, they play in front of a reworking of that band’s iconic Unknown Pleasures artwork – with little wombats – and dancing costumed bears. Panic! At the Disco singer Brendon Urie was knocked unconscious by a bottle on stage at Reading in 2006, but he returns in triumph after remodelling his fading emo princes into a modern Queen, complete with classical musicians, an unfeasible falsetto and a perfect Bohemian Rhapsody. Other headliners seem picked to appease a slightly older rock crowd. Stadium dustbowl rockers Kings of Leon headlined here in 2009, and that era’s Sex on Fire (still) generates the weekend’s biggest singalong. Veteran pop-punks Fall Out Boy also party like it’s the noughties with a career-ning setlist, although they didn’t have flame-throwing bass guitars back then. Rap has a mixed weekend. Post Malone’s catchy tunes go down much better in the afternoon sunshine than Travis Scott’s heavily Auto-Tuned discourses, and the audience steadfastly resist Pharrell Williams’ urges to “make some noise!” for his hip-hop band, NERD.Kendrick Lamar has won a Pulitzer prize, but has never faced the unique challenge of a soggy field in Yorkshire. Closing the festival in Sunday’s monsoon, his late-starting set (with a live band) is a blitzkrieg of rapid-fire wordplay, humorous kung fu movies, references to police brutality and music that hurtles dizzyingly from jazz to rock to funk in milliseconds. Disappointingly, though, he doesn’t say much to the crowd and the weekend’s biggest audience is thinner by the end, although this is perhaps less to do with the Compton superstar’s performance than the promise of a nice warm bath."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/481f3a7cfae9365a198543d05165d7e32a322b82/119_303_4444_2668/master/4444.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=833c7bfd45738df6878d91a868de745a","title":"german business brexit joachim lang","story":"Senior business leader says effects would be much more serious than UK admitsMany businesses in Germany are still hoping the UK reverses its decision to leave the EU, according to one of the country’s top business leaders, who also warned of the dangers of a no-deal Brexit.Foreign investment in the UK had plummeted, he said, which was “a dramatic development which should prompt urgent action from the government in London”.Lang did not mince his words when asked whether German industry would like to see Brexit reversed in a second referendum. “Voters voted for Brexit, that should be respected,” said Lang. “But it would save a lot of businesspeople sleepless nights if the British stayed in the EU.”The UK is Germany’s fifth-largest trading partner and imported €84bn (£76bn) worth of German goods last year, but these are uncertain times for the 2,200 UK-based German businesses and their 412,000 employees.

It hosts sellers that offer to ship synthetic opioid drugs to the UK.The project examined activity on Weiku for six months. It found that while searching for “fentanyl” on the website returned zero results, the website offered related searches such as “Fentanyl,” or “Fentanyl patches”. Some of those advertising under these search categories had their accounts deleted, while others still sold the substances.Those who analysed the website were able to find sellers willing to ship fentanyl and other substances. The drug appeared frequently on the website over the period analysed and, as well as fentanyl, Weiku also hosted people selling bromadol, which is estimated to be five times the strength of fentanyl. One seller of this drug on the website produced a US certificate for a dog examination in lieu of a business licence.Sellers on the site also advertised pentobarbital, a short-acting barbiturate that can cause death when used in high doses. It is used in euthanasia programmes in the Netherlands and executions in US states such as Texas. One seller promoted the product as “peaceful death”.When approached, one seller said: “Our fentanyl powder is very pure ... We can send to you safely in the UK. Delivery will be done through UPS or Fedex.” The seller offered 50g for $700 (£540).Weiku is based in the eastern city of Hangzhou . When approached by the , the company said that it regularly checked for sellers of illegal drugs such as fentanyl, and deleted those accounts.A representative admitted, however, that searches for fentanyl could return results. “It does happen that sellers and buyer create new ways to make deals on our site, but Weiku is not able to discover this right away.” The firm said it did weekly inspections. “As an information platform, Weiku needs to make sure all information is legal, but we are not accountable for the transactions,” it said.The findings come as the head of the National Crime Agency (NCA) told the  that vast majority of the synthetic opioids coming into the UK were from China. The NCA said that most synthetic drugs, including the synthetic cannabinoid spice, came into Britain from the east Asia.he said the drug was mainly sent through the post and was then sold on the dark web, a part of the internet only accessible through a particular browser. also found another Chinese website, DIYTrade – China Product Directory, where fentanyl and carfentanyl, which is 100 times more potent than fentanyl, were offered for sale. One seller, when contacted, said they offered 10g for $280 or 100g for $1,100. They said: “Yes, we can ship carfentanyl to London ... how many ... do u need?”DIYTrade did not respond to requests for a comment.Another Chinese website, Mfrbee, had dozens of listings under the search term “opioids”, although links to fentanyl appeared to be blocked. Other opioid analgesic drugs are sold with shipping options.The website also hosts vendors purporting to sell Xanax, a benzodiazepine, and pregabalin, a medication used to treat epilepsy and generalised anxiety disorder. Both are illegal without a prescription in the UK.The market for synthetic drugs in China is driven by demand abroad. The authorities control fentanyl, but they did not begin restricting its two most common ingredients until this year, more than a decade after the US.The law in China has got tighter in recent years, however, with more than 130 synthetic drugs – including at least 10 fentanyl analogues – added to the country’s list of controlled substances since 2015. Chinese regulators say they struggle with the speed at which chemists are able to produce new variations on fentanyl, circumventing the government ban on analogues.Additional reporting by Wang Xueying"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/925be4c69865343cce64e82e4cc6981404a81a6d/725_466_2321_1393/master/2321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=872ffaed5bb5140c9fefdbb67579f2cf","title":"chepstow meeting abondoned two races","story":"A big bank holiday crowd left Chepstow racecourse disappointed in mid-afternoon on Monday after the stewards ordered the abandonment of racing at the Welsh track due to “the unsafe condition of parts of the racing surface”.Only two races were run at the meeting, which is one of the most popular Flat fixtures of the year at Chepstow, and both were followed by inspections of the track involving jockeys, trainers and officials. After the first race, over six furlongs, a decision was taken to proceed with the next event on the card over the same trip but with the stalls moved three yards down the track.A subsequent inspection after the second race, however, looked into concerns about false patches of ground both on the straight course and on the bend into the home straight, and one rider appeared to pull a large clod of turf and mud from the course. The stewards decided racing should be abandoned shortly afterwards.Chepstow, like most of Britain’s tracks, has received plenty of rain in recent days and the official going was changed to soft, from good-to-soft, soft in places, after the first race. While the decision to abandon the meeting was ultimately a straightforward one, however, questions may be asked about how and why two races were run on the course before the meeting was called off. It is also possible the British Horseracing Authority will seek to clarify the circumstances surrounding the abandonment.Too Darn Hot, second-favourite for next year’s Derby, could make the second start of his career in the Group Three Solario Stakes at Sandown Park on Saturday.Tips by Greg Wood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d51a30e03137a1aa00fa23ffbd0f36f069a4f8d2/71_14_3284_1971/master/3284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f6ee4c55b31abcf1461d0a563f11c313","title":"halo worth made clear spa belgium gp charles leclerc","story":"The halo cockpit protection device found few fans when it was imposed by the FIA at the start of this season. Certainly on aesthetic grounds, no one liked it but its role was to improve safety around the drivers’ head, an area identified by the FIA as one of the last remaining vulnerable areas of the car. They had the data to back up their decision to implement it, which changed the mind of some naysayers, including Lewis Hamilton. At Spa, its worth was made clear to all. Whether the device specifically prevented Charles Leclerc from serious injury or worse in the crash with Fernando Alonso is irrelevant. Looking at the incident, it would have been a miracle, as the race director, Charlie Whiting, put it, were Leclerc not at least hit in the head but for the halo. Which is justification enough. There may be better looking alternatives to come in future but for now halo as earned its place on every car.The clear power advantage Ferrari enjoyed in Belgium was a major step forward for the Scuderia and left Hamilton and Mercedes concerned about how they could catch up. Hamilton referred to the tricks they have on the car, which some interpreted as illegal advantages. Hamilton denied this and it was dismissed by Whiting. “We know quite a lot about the Ferrari car and there is no way Lewis would know anything about the Ferrari car,” he said. “If he says they’ve got a few tricks going on that car, well clearly they have got things going on which are giving it performance which all of us in the FIA are aware of and obviously are happy with.” The Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, conceded Ferrari’s were ahead but not just in power. His team was also losing time with poor traction out of the slow corners. They must be hopeful of better in the largely high-speed curves of Monza but Ferrari are strong favourites to win their home race.Mercedes are more than aware of how important this can be, the potential gains from fuel have been estimated as up to three-tenths of a second. A formula Petronas now need to find.Despite losing all their points in coming out of administration, Force India’s rebirth as Racing Point Force India (or Force India as everyone still refers to them) could not have gone better. The team have some history at Spa, where they have always performed well. In their original incarnation as Jordan they took their first win here in 1998 with Damon Hill and also their first pole in the hands of Rubens Barrichello in 1994. Giancarlo Fisichella also took Force India’s first podium and points at Spa in 2009. They were on fire again this year. Esteban Ocon and Sergio Pérez did brilliantly in qualifying to take third and fourth and then in the race the pair showed no fear, going almost four abreast with Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel on the Kemmel straight. Ocon believed if he had had another metre he could have taken the lead into Les Combes. They finished fifth and sixth, immediately putting points on the board, overtaking Williams and going into ninth place.Unfortunately for Ocon, he may not last much longer to enjoy the resurgence at Force India. Pérez is expected to remain but it is believed, unsurprisingly, that the head of the consortium that now owns the team, Lawrence Stroll, is eager to move his son in, perhaps as soon as the Singapore Grand Prix on 16 September. What happens next is still up in the air. Ocon is a Mercedes driver and they rate him highly. He is being prepared as the potential works driver to step in when Hamilton calls it a day. Wolff says he is confident they will find a seat for him, with McLaren looking to be the most likely candidates. It has to be hoped a drive can be found for the Frenchman as he is a genuine talent but he finds himself in a complex web of negotiations. Once the Stroll domino topples, however, expect swift movement all round, not least in Robert Kubica resuming his F1 career at Williams."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10b5ab0bd09c5ff3414a673ff6ec0a3f78063b24/0_72_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=180ec2de5bb7fb7c848afc3639e556f8","title":"raw speed elia viviani sprint stage vuelta","story":"The Italian national champion Elia Viviani won the first sprint stage of the Vuelta a España on Monday, demonstrating raw speed to edge out Giacomo Nizzolo and the world champion Peter Sagan on a false-flat finish in Alhaurín de la Torre. Team Sky’s Michal Kwiatkowski finished safely in the bunch to retain the red leader’s jersey at the Spanish Grand Tour.Before stage three the race’s technical director, Kiko Garcia, issued a warning to the fast men. “It is supposed to be the first sprinters’ stage,” he said. “But they should be wary of the course, with a long climb again at the start.”There was no need to worry. After a scenic departure from seaside Mijas, a tepid breakaway led by the Frenchman Pierre Rolland never seriously threatened the peloton on a balmy afternoon in southern Spain. While the lead group was first to the summit category one Puerto del Madrono and category three Puerto del Viento – extending the polka dot jersey lead of Cofidis’s Luis Ángel Maté – the break never looked capable of staying away.Jordi Simon from the local team Burgos-BH made several valiant attacks on his own but his hopes were extinguished as the race again passed a town called Mijas – this time a hillside citadel village. The Austrian Lukas Pöstlberger then succeeded where Simon had failed, managing to establish enough of a solo lead to make the peloton nervy. He was eventually caught with six kilometres remaining, setting up an exciting bunch sprint on the outskirts of Málaga.After controlling the race all day Quick-Step Floors executed perfectly in the final kilometre to deliver Viviani to the line. The Italian won the sprint jersey at the Giro d’Italia this year and his performance on Monday suggested he could mirror that feat in Spain.“It was beautiful,” said Viviani, a 2016 Olympic gold medallist on the track, following his victory. “I think I have no words again for the team. Being the strongest is always difficult because no one helps us to pull.” The sprinter has been in ominous form, winning the EuroEyes Cyclassics in Hamburg only last week. “I’m really happy. This wonderful season continues.”There were no significant changes to the general classification rankings. Kwiatkowski holds a 14-second advantage from Movistar’s Spanish veteran Alejandro Valverde, while Britain’s Simon Yates is 37 seconds away from the red jersey.The Vuelta continues on Tuesday with a gruelling 161.4 km stage, as the race leaves the Costa del Sol and heads inland towards Granada. The stage features two category one climbs, the Carretera de la Cabra (goat’s road) ascent and a summit finish at Sierra de la Alfaguara."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bb51b2418dca58df7cb86e1175c3d0f2bdfbb16a/0_128_5327_3196/master/5327.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7d93538b7ba5b9fb61db3838b35abbe6","title":"somerset nottinghamshire t20 match report","story":"The captaincy can enhance a cricketer and there was another example of this phenomenon here yesterday as Somerset’s Lewis Gregory produced a glittering performance to earn a semi‑final against Sussex at Edgbaston, on 15 September, in what has become a coveted day out for county cricketers. Gregory, not for the first time in this campaign, produced a blistering innings, in this instance 60 from 24 balls. It was peppered with five sixes and enabled his side to post 209 for five, a challenging target in a knockout game when there is more tension about. In the field he grabbed\u0026nbspthe vital catch of the day at cover to dismiss Alex Hales, the one man who threatened to upset Somerset’s progress, and for good measure he took two for 29 from his four overs as well as overseeing affairs adroitly in the field.Aside from Gregory, Somerset were indebted to a silky 52 from James Hildreth he also ran brilliantly with Tom Abell, who picked a good time to register his career best (46 not out) in this format. There was also a perky 27 from Johann Myburgh, a very popular figure here, who was playing his last game at Taunton.Hales threatened to chase down the target on his own. After Jamie Overton had dismissed Riki Wessels with his first ball, Hales hit the next four deliveries, some of little merit, for four. He now has the capacity to intimidate white-ball bowlers just by taking guard. He was dropped on 35 off Gregory by Abell at deep square-leg, which might have been a decisive moment but that was the last fielding blemish from Somerset.Once Hales had been caught the run chase faltered and Overton ended up with three more wickets in his leg-trap, which comprised the wonderfully athletic Max Waller at deep midwicket, who once again caught everything that came his way.Even though this game had been rescheduled after the rains of Sunday, the stands were full. It was, in some ways, a subdued, sober affair, simply because the fans were anxious. They were not here for the beer – or the cider – but to see a side with whom they identify so strongly, win.

The Stars then bowled out Loughborough for 117, the 19-year-old Mady Villiers finishing her four overs with three for 22. Only three of the Lightning’s top six could muster double figures in a disappointing response.“I don’t think we were at our best today,” the Lightning captain, Georgia Elwiss, said. “It is disappointing because we had a good campaign and we know we can play better than we’ve played today.”The performance from Surrey was particularly impressive given the Lightning were considered strong favourites before Finals Day, and the team setting a total had never before won a game on KSL Finals Day. Surrey broke the record in spectacular fashion, put into bat by the opposing captains in both the semi‑final and the final and triumphant both times.“We knew we could do it – we’ve got a brilliant batting order and some really good young bowlers,” the Stars captain, Nat Sciver, said.The win will also be of particular interest to South African fans before the Women’s World Twenty20 in November, with three of their players – Lee and the bowlers Marizanne Kapp (two for 14) and Dane van Niekerk (three for 37) making key contributions to the win.“Everything clicked and it all just came together,” said Lee, who was player of the match for her 104. “We didn’t have a target in mind, we just went with it. I’m so proud of the girls.”Though she survived several early chances, including a close lbw shout against the left-arm spinner Kirstie Gordon, Lee eventually brought up her century – her first in T20 cricket – in the 16th over in convincing fashion, walloping the ball through backward square-leg. Earlier in the innings she had brought up Stars’ 100 with a huge six over deep midwicket.Sciver, who hit an unbeaten 72 in the semi-final, also contributed a 31-ball 40, the pair sharing a 111-run third‑wicket partnership. “I\u0026nbspdidn’t have to do too much – just get Lee on strike,” Sciver said. “She has worked really hard on her batting this summer, and it is a great way to finish the tournament.”Loughborough’s hopes of chasing such a mammoth total rested on their leading run-scorers across the tournament, the openers Sophie Devine of New Zealand and the Australian Rachael Haynes. Devine fell lbw to Kapp in the second over of the innings, while Sophia Dunkley had Haynes caught at point in the seventh over.Van Niekerk sent England’s Amy Jones back to the pavilion in the following over, before her two in two balls in the 10th did for Georgia Elwiss and Georgia Adams, and Loughborough sank to 63 for six at the halfway point. Gunn defended the hat-trick ball, finishing unbeaten on 23 in a performance that will do her World T20 selection hopes no harm, and the Lightning gradually limped over 100.Villiers then wrapped things up with a four-over spell that included 11 dot balls and three wickets, as the Lightning sunk to 117 all out – Linsey Smith the final wicket to fall in the 19th over.All in all it was a somewhat disappointing climax to the third Super League for the neutral though not for Surrey, who were clearly ecstatic as they ran into a huddle to celebrate their first KSL victory."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dce8222f993b4f31ae9225b5296188308551a03/0_141_3388_2034/master/3388.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=492abf62b8075e0b9773fd6560364b94","title":"memory lane 40 years us open flushing meadows tennis","story":"2018 sees the 40th anniversary of the US Open’s move from the clay courts of the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills to the hard courts at the USTA National Tennis Center in Queens"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7249277fa0c218bfa2912b84b90e34080268741/0_0_4626_3177/master/4626.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d9c23357d7dceea9f09e7ca68335c2ef 1440w","title":"michael cooper chicago 68 photographs","story":"Michael Cooper was most famous for shooting candid moments with the Rolling Stones and the cover of the Beatles’ 1967 album Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band.

The first major political test for his new centrist movement, La République en Marche, is next spring’s European elections, where he is hoping to prove that the centre ground can limit the rise of far-right parties and Eurosceptics in Europe.But Macron conceded that much had changed in the past year. He warned of an “awakening of nationalists and extremes” in Europe and hit out at what he called US president Donald Trump’s “aggressive isolationism”.Macron’s comments follow Trump’s repeated distancing himself from the Nato military alliance, which groups the US with most of Europe and has underpinned European security since the second world war. “The partner with whom Europe built the new post-world war order appears to be turning its back on this shared history,” he told French ambassadors gathered at the Élysée Palace.Macron defended his policy of maintaining a close relationship with Trump, who has shunned European allies by pulling out of a global climate pact, imposing extraterritorial sanctions on Iran and imposing tariffs on EU steel and aluminium. Macron said communication with Washington had to be open and constructive, but European countries had to work together to come up with alternatives to hardline isolationist politics. “The question is not about whether I grab Trump by the arm at the next international summit the question is, what are we going to reinvent?”He said moments such as the UK’s Brexit vote, the Trump election or the success of Hungary’s Viktor Orbán were linked to a crisis in modern globalisation and it was now up to countries to overhaul global governance and make globalisation more “human”.But since Macron vowed last year to overhaul the EU – pushing for deep political reforms, including a separate budget for the eurozone – he has appeared isolated, amid a rise of Eurosceptic and nationalist parties in countries from Italy to Hungary and gains by the far right in Germany. Macron insisted that France had to push on with EU reforms because “we’re paying the price of several decades of a Europe that has become bland, weakened and hasn’t made enough suggestions”. He added: “Do China and the United States think of Europe as a power with similar independence to their own? It is not the case.”Macron said France respected the UK’s Brexit vote and wanted to maintain a strong, strategic relationship with London, but he warned he would not allow the move to be to the detriment of EU unity, which was his priority."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a80c8e3035071b993f8cda86ddb05ba879f24c4/0_65_2412_1447/master/2412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c85b78a434ab324edc0b9f5309dfb0d3","title":"germany xenophobic riots chemnitz far right pegida","story":"Chancellor says far-right protests in eastern city of Chemnitz ‘have no place in our country’The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, has condemned far-right protesters for “hunting down” foreigners in street mobs following the killing of a German man, allegedly by a Syrian and an Iraqi.The far-right movement Pegida called for a second day of demonstrations after about 800 people in the eastern city of Chemnitz rioted, forcing police to call in reinforcements.It was reported that some demonstrators on Sunday had shouted “We are the people”, “Get lost” and “You’re not welcome here” at any people they believed to be immigrants.Prosecutors said on Monday that police had arrested a 23-year-old Syrian man and a 22-year-old Iraqi man on suspicion of stabbing the 35-year-old German in an altercation in the early hours of Sunday. “The investigation, especially into the motive, the details of the crime and the murder weapon continue,” a statement said.In the far-right riots that followed, some protesters used bottles to attack foreign-looking people, the freelance journalist Johannes Grunert, who reports frequently on the far-right scene, told Spiegel Online.Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, condemned the violent protests. “Such riotous assemblies, the hunting down of people who appear to be from different backgrounds or the attempt to spread hate in the streets, these have no place in our country,” he said.Asked about an apparent call for vigilante action by a politician from the far-right AfD party, Seibert said it was up to the legal system to deliver justice in a constitutional democracy. The AfD MP Markus Frohnmaier had tweeted: “If the state can no longer protect the citizen, then people will go on the streets and protect themselves.”The violent altercation in which the German man was killed took place at 3am on Sunday, on the sidelines of a street festival. Two other men aged 33 and 38 were taken to hospital with severe injuries, police said.The mayor of Chemnitz, Barbara Ludwig, said she was horrified by Sunday’s demonstrations. “The fact that people can agree to meet … run through town and threaten people is bad,” she told the regional broadcaster MDR.Amid growing outrage over the scenes of xenophobic violence, left-leaning activists called for a counter-protest on Monday in the city, hours before Pegida supporters were due to gather.Pegida’s Chemnitz and West Saxony regional chapter urged its supporters to “Muster strength from anger and sadness!

The Tatmadaw also carried out murders, imprisonments, enforced disappearances, torture, rapes and used sexual slavery and other forms of sexual violence, persecution and enslavement – all of which constitute crimes against humanity.In northern Rakhine, the mission also found evidence of mass extermination and deportation.“The fact-finding mission’s powerful report and clear recommendations demonstrate the obvious need for concrete steps to advance criminal justice for atrocious crimes, instead of more hollow condemnations and expressions of concern,” said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “This report should eliminate any doubt about the urgency of investigating those responsible for mass atrocities.”The mission, prompted by the UN security council visit in March, called for an investigation into the military’s actions in Rakhine. The campaign of violence against the Rohingya began a year ago. An estimated 25,000 people have been killed and 700,000 have fled over the border to Bangladesh.Following the report’s publication, the UK foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, tweeted that he would visit the country “to seek answers at the earliest opportunity”.Min Aung Hlaing has occupied the highest office of Myanmar’s military since 2011 and is described as the “most powerful man in the land”, with all military under his control. His hatred of the Rohingya is well-known and he spoke openly of solving “the long-standing Bengali problem” in Myanmar. He travelled to Rakhine before and during the military’s genocide of the Rohingya to oversee the violence and later said the tensions in Rakhine were “fuelled because the Bengalis demanded citizenship.Soe Win has been has been in the position of commander-in-chief (army) since 2011. He has been dogged by allegations of corruption, accused of accepting bribes from companies dealing in jade, timber, and gold. As commander in chief of the army he oversaw successive “clearance operations” in Rakhine state and numerous human rights violations at the hand of the military in Kachin state over the past seven years.As commander of Bureau of Special Operations-3 (BOS 3) Kyaw Zaw controlled all military operations in Rakhine state from 2015 until January 2018. It was under his watch that the military enforced a regime of systematic oppression and domination against the Rohingya which eventually built up to the violence and genocide in 2017.Maung Maung Soe was the commander of western regional military command, the unit who carried out the massacre in Maung Nu in Rakhine state in August 2017. The unit participated in other unlawful killings in at least several dozen other villages, raped and committed other sexual violence against women and girls, and burned villages across northern Rakhine state.As commander of the 33rd Light Infantry Division, it was under his command that troops carried out the massacre, torture, and rape and other sexual violence in Chut Pyin in August 2017 and he personally made threats against Rohingya leaders in the village.\u0026nbspThe 99th Light Infantry Division\u0026nbspunder Than Oo’s command carried out the massacre, torture, and rape and other sexual violence in Min Gyi on 30 August 2017. They burned other Rohingya villages in northern Maungdaw Township. In May 2018, he was quietly stripped of his command transferred to the “auxiliary forces”, which is believed to be a response to pressure from the UN to hold the military accountable for the actions in Rakhine. However, he has never been formally investigated or charged by the military.Laying out the legal argument for genocide to have taken place, the UN report said: “The crimes in Rakhine state, and the manner in which they were perpetrated, are similar in nature, gravity and scope to those that have allowed genocidal intent to be established in other contexts.”Iniduals singled out for investigation and prosecution for genocide and crimes against humanity included Min Aung Hlaing, the commander-in-chief of the Tatmadaw, who has openly stated his intention to solve “the long-standing Bengali problem”.“There is sufficient information to warrant the investigation and prosecution of senior officials in the Tatmadaw chain of command, so that a competent court can determine their liability for genocide in relation to the situation in Rakhine state,” the report said.Minutes after the report was released, Facebook removed 18 accounts and 52 pages associated with the Myanmar military, including that of Min Aung Hlaing. It comes in the wake of months of criticism of the company for failing to combat the spread of hate speech on Facebook in Myanmar. The Tatmadaw have often used their Facebook pages to spread disinformation and anti-Rohingya sentiment, such as photos of dismembered children posted to Min Aung Hlaing’s page, claiming they were killed by “Muslim terrorists”.“We want to prevent them from using our service to further inflame ethnic and religious tensions,” the company said. The pages and accounts that were removed had a total of almost 12 million followers.The UN mission called for Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, to be investigated by the international criminal court (ICC). Although the country is not a signatory to the Rome statute, and therefore not under the jurisdiction of the court, ICC prosecutors are deliberating whether they can investigate the violence in Rakhine.The UN report also prompted Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, Fortify Rights and Save the Children to push for Myanmar to be investigated by the ICC.“The international community has the responsibility to act to ensure justice and accountability,” said Tirana Hassan, the director of crisis response at Amnesty International. “Failing to do so sends a dangerous message that Myanmar’s military will not only enjoy impunity but is free to commit such atrocities again.”Michael McGrath, the country director for Save the Children in Myanmar, added: “Children and their families have been murdered, sexually assaulted and forced to flee burning villages, and they have not yet seen the justice they deserve. Establishing the facts through the fact-finding mission was a critical first step to achieving justice however now there must be a move towards investigations for prosecution.”The UN report is very likely to anger Myanmar’s military and government, which have denied genocide has occurred in Rakhine and claimed that the Rohingya – whom they regularly refer to as “illegal Bengali immigrants” – instigated the violence by attacking security forces and then burning their own villages to the ground. Both the military and the civilian government, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, have stated that the actions of the armed forces were an appropriate response to “terrorists”.The Tatmadaw’s own investigation, widely considered a farce, cleared the armed forces of all wrongdoing and the head of Aung San Suu Kyi’s newly established inquiry into Rakhine has said there would be no “finger-pointing, blaming, to say ‘you’re accountable’”.The UN said that, with Myanmar’s repeated failure to admit genocide had taken place and with the legal impunity given to the military, it fell to the international community to hold those responsible to account.Mark Field, the UK’s minister of state for Asia and the Pacific, said “there cannot and must not be impunity for such acts”, but stopped short of calling for Myanmar to be referred to the ICC."},{"url":null,"title":"smart","story":"Practical, hands-on courses offer career progression and skills enhancement outside traditional CAO system"},{"url":null,"title":"pope francis welcomed by president michael d higgins","story":"  August 25, 2018Pontiff addresses crowd of 82,000 at Croke Park at the end of the first day of his visit "},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Reporters accused of illegally possessing official documentsMove against hate speech after UN report accuses miltary of genocide in treatment of RohingyaSecurity forces carried out \u0026lsquocrimes against humanity\u0026rsquo against Rohingya and other groupsNegotiations remain deadlocked as Mike Pompeo\u0026rsquos visit cancelledJulie Bishop announces move to backbench after Scott Morrison wins leadership battlePark Geun-hye was ousted from office last year and jailed on corruption chargesTurnbull blames \u0026lsquoinsurgency\u0026rsquo in Liberal Party \u0026lsquobacked by powerful voices in the media\u0026rsquoMore than 380,000 minors lack education and basic facilities in Bangladesh campsMalcolm Turnbull faces likely ousting on Friday after caving in too often to conservativesPrime Minister Malcolm Turnbull accuses rival\u0026rsquos supporters of bullying MPs in bid to force him outUN atomic watchdog observed actions consistent with uranium enrichment, says reportChallenger Peter Dutton says he is working on renewed bid to unseat Malcolm TurnbullJulie Anne Genter the country\u0026rsquos second member of the government, after prime minister Jacinda Ardern, to give birth this yearBeijing Letter: Election of bishops a key to power struggle for China\u0026rsquos CatholicsEl Salvador is third diplomatic ally this year to switch from TaipeiNobel laureate target of flak over Rohingya exodus, but says generals all \u0026lsquorather sweet\u0026rsquoRelations have deteriorated sharply between neighbouring states in past three yearsMalcolm Turnbull sees off attempted coup by Peter Dutton but could face another vote soonTaiwan now has formal relations with just 17 countries worldwideKabul government forces report rescue of 150 bus passengers abducted by insurgents"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3609206.1535382179!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"facebook removes accounts linked to myanmar s military","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMen walk at a Rohingya village outside Maungdaw in Rakhine state, Myanmar in October 2016. Facebook posts have stirred up and spread hatred against the minority Rohingya population in Myanmar. Photograph: Soe Zeya TunReutersIn an unusually prompt move, the pages and accounts of the Mynamar military, known as the Tatmadaw, were deleted just minutes after the UN fact-finding mission released its damning report. Facebook, which is a highly popular source of information in Myanmar, has come under criticism for giving a platform to vitriolic posts aimed at stirring up and spreading hatred against the minority Muslim Rohingya population. About 25,000 have been killed and 700,000 forced to flee to Bangldesh in a campaign of violence in the past year. There have been several incidents of mob violence, both Buddhist and Muslim, after messages spread on Facebook messenger about bogus attacks. The UN report named several generals, including the head of the military, Min Aung Hlaing, who “must be investigated and prosecuted for genocide in the north of Rakhine state, as well as for crimes against humanity and war crimes”. In response, Facebook removed six pages and six accounts associated with him and other military commanders.“We want to prevent them from using our service to further inflame ethnic and religious tensions,” the company said. The removed pages and accounts had a total of almost 12 million followers.This month it admitted it had been “too slow” in tackling hate speech in Myanmar on Facebook. The company had already pledged to hire more Burmese speakers to monitor hate speech on Facebook, but the removal of the military-linked accounts shows a step-up in actions against those accused of promoting anti-Rohingya rhetoric. The official page of the military’s Myawaddy television network was among those to be taken down.The Tatmadaw regularly uses its official Facebook pages to discredit allegations of the crimes it has committed in Rahkine and to stir up fears about the Rohingya, who they often referred to as “Bengali terrorists” or “Bengali illegal immigrants”. Facebook said it had carried out an investigation which found the Tatmadaw “used seemingly independent news and opinion pages to covertly push the messages of the Myanmar military. This type of behaviour is banned on Facebook because we want people to be able to trust the connections they make.”The Facebook account for the de facto leader of the Myanmar government, Aung San Suu Kyi, was not removed, although there are allegations that it has been used to spread misinformation about the Rohingya and the violence in Rahkine. While Ms Suu Kyi was not implicated by in the UN report, she was criticised for failing to use her “position as head of government, or her moral authority, to stem or prevent the unfolding events in Rakhine state”.The move by Facebook comes less than a month after it deleted 32 pages and accounts attempting to influence the US midterm elections, and just days after it removed 652 fake Facebook accounts and pages and pages intent on influencing politics in US, UK, Middle East and Latin America. – "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3608974.1535364412!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"myanmar s military accused of genocide in damning un report","story":"One million Rohingya live in the world’s largest refugee settlement in Bangladesh.

her husband Peter Murrell.The latest developments came as Ms Sturgeon insisted again there was no legal basis on which to suspend Mr Salmond from the SNP, and as Mr Salmond was reported to have written to Leslie Evans, Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Government, asking if there will be a “leak” inquiry, and claiming data protection law has been breached.Alex Salmond plans to challenge government process in courtRhoda Grant, Labour’s women’s spokesman, said a safe space for other women to come forward in future could not be created if they knew “the head of the government investigating their claims is prepared to meet with the alleged perpetrator on multiple occasions and subsequently refuse to reveal what was said”.She added: “It would be completely unacceptable if the details of those meetings remain hidden from the Scottish people.“That is why I have today submitted a series of Freedom of Information requests to try and give the public as much detail over what their current and former first ministers discussed.“Members of the public understand that the government will be restricted in some regards due to Mr Salmond\u0027s legal action against them, but basic details surrounding these meetings should be released to them.“The allegations against Alex Salmond are incredibly serious. His meetings with the head of a government that was investigating him must not be kept under wraps.” The Scottish Conservatives, meanwhile, asked Ms Evans, Scotland’s top civil servant, whether any complaints were raised against Mr Salmond before January this year, when two members of staff came forward over alleged incidents in December 2013.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said there were no complaints about Mr Salmond prior to January 2018, adding: “For legal reasons we are unable to provide further detail at this time.“However, in the fullness of time the Scottish Government will seek to make available as much information as it can.”Mr Salmond has described the allegations as “patently ridiculous” and has complained about the lack of confidentiality in the process and called for an inquiry into government “leaks”.Meanwhile, Ms Sturgeon said that in other cases where SNP politicians had been suspended the investigations had been carried out by the party, but on this occasion the SNP had not received complaints directly about Mr Salmond.She added: “It\u0027s been a Scottish Government investigation and for legal reasons right now, the information cannot be shared with the SNP.”Jeremy Corbyn will face pressure from union leaders to back a second Brexit referendumJohn McCain warned America against \u0026#39tribal rivalries\u0026#39 and \u0026#39hiding behind walls\u0026#39 in final messageListening to soothing yoga music at bedtime is good for your heart, say scientists Russian claims that US and UK are plotting Syria chemical attack \u0026#39ridiculous\u0026#39, says British general Donald Trump announces new US trade agreement with Mexico and ditches the name \u0026#39Nafta\u0026#39 Comment: The UN\u0026#39s damning report on Burma should herald the end of empty talk and the time for actionJos Brech arrested in Spain for 1998 murder of Nicky Verstappen after 20-year manhuntComment: Victoria Atkins deserves praise, not vilification, for speaking of her caution over transgenderismSpanish homes sold at knock-down prices -

The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/09/20/17/rexfeatures_4080054a.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2014/09/20/17/rexfeatures_4080054a.jpg","title":"beluga whale menopause narwhal human species wild","story":"Created with Sketch.\u0027Older females\u0027 knowledge of where to find food helps groups survive – but if she keeps reproducing, her new young would compete with older offspring, researchers sayClick to followThe IndependentBeluga whales, like humans, stop reproducing after middle ageBeluga whales and narwhals go through the menopause in the same way as women, scientists have discovered.Along with humans, other toothed whales – killer whales and short-finned pilots – were the only others previously known to experience the menopause.Almost all animals continue reproducing throughout their lives, and scientists have long been puzzled about why some have evolved to stop doing so.Most species in the wild continue reproducing until they die.The new study, by the universities of Exeter and York and the Center for Whale Research, used data on dead whales from 16 species, and found dormant ovaries in the females of older belugas – small white mammals – and narwhals – medium-sized single-tusked creatures found in the Canadian and Greenland Arctic seas.The researchers believe older females are useful to groups but if they continued having calves into old age, the new youngsters would be competing with her earlier offspring.Visitors are greeted by an Orca killer whale as they attend a show featuring the whales during a visit to the animal theme park SeaWorld in San Diego, California March 19, 2014.

For menopause to make sense in evolutionary terms, a species needs both a reason to stop reproducing and a reason to live on afterwards, said lead author Dr Sam Ellis, of the University of Exeter.In killer whales, the reason to stop comes because both male and female offspring stay with their mothers for life so as a female ages, her group contains more and more of her children and grandchildren.This increasing relatedness means that, if she keeps having young, they compete with her own direct descendants for resources such as food.The reason to continue living is that older females are of great benefit to their offspring and grand-offspring. For example, their knowledge of where to find food helps groups survive.Dead whales beached on the North Sea coastTwo dead sperm whales are seen washed up on a beach near Skegness in northeast England.

Sketch.High levels of artificial noise blamed for shortening lifes in the wildClick to followThe IndependentZebra finches are affected by traffic noise after they have flown the nestTraffic noise may make birds age more quickly than is natural, scientists have found.A study on zebra finches suggested those exposed to the sounds of road vehicles were less protected from damage linked with ageing. \u0026nbspPrevious research has\u0026nbspconcluded that urban birds have shorter lifes than their rural counterparts, and academics believe high levels of artificial noise may play a role.Researchers at the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology in Germany and North Dakota State University investigated the effect of traffic noise on the length of the telomere –\u0026nbspcaps on the ends of chromosomes that protect genes from damage – of offspring zebra finches,\u0026nbspa species native to Australia.The study, published in Frontiers in Zoology, said that zebra finches exposed to traffic noise after they had left the nest had shorter telomeres at 120 days old even than those exposed to noise before they had left the nest and whose parents were exposed to traffic noise during courtship, egg-laying, and nesting.Finches exposed to noise after leaving the nest also had shorter telomeres than those that had not been exposed to traffic noise at all.Although birds may seem to be adapting to life in noisy cities, they may actually be ageing fasterDr Adriana Dorado-Correa, co-author of the study, said: “Our study suggests that urban noise alone, independent from the many other aspects of city life, such as light pollution or chemical pollution, is associated with increased telomere loss and may contribute to ageing in zebra finches.“Our study is a first step towards identifying the causal mechanisms that may account for differences in life observed between birds living in urban or rural environments.”Co-author Dr Sue Anne Zollinger said: “Cellular ageing as a result of urban stressors is something that may not have a very visible impact, but our study indicates that although birds may seem to be adapting to life in noisy cities, they may actually be ageing faster.“It may be important to consider developmental stages in birds when studying the effects of urbanisation, as the mechanisms by which these human-induced habitat changes impact iniduals may change throughout their lifetime.”Woodland birds en route to extinction as numbers eThe authors suggested that the time between 18 and 120 days after hatching is a critical period during which birds are more affected by noise. This period is when zebra finches begin learning songs, which may make them more sensitive to noise\u0026nbspBy contrast, birds may be less sensitive to noise\u0026nbspwhile still in the nest, and parent birds may be able to make behavioural changes to protect offspring from the negative effects of noise exposure, the researchers said.The traffic noise used in the study consisted of recordings of street traffic that mimicked typical urban noise patterns.Previous\u0026nbspresearch has found birds sing differently in response to industrial or traffic noise, which potentially affects their ability to attract mates and defend their territory.A 2016 study suggested traffic noise may endanger wild birds by making it harder for them to hear alarm calls.Enter your email addressFill out this

treatments, new figures reveal.The UK receives €1.28bn (£1.15bn) every year from Horizon 2020, the EU’s funding programme for science and innovation.The nation would lose around 45 per cent of the cash, and its ability to influence key European projects, in a no-deal scenario, according to analysis by the Scientists for EU group.The government had previously attempted to reassure scientists by claiming they would still have access to EU funding under ‘third country’ rules, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.But following the publication this week of their plans for a no-deal Brexit, the government has updated advice to scientists to concede funding from the EU would be lost.\u0026nbsp“Third country participation does not extend to some Horizon 2020 calls”, the advice now reads.That line\u0026nbspupdated a report published at the beginning of August which said: “In a no-deal scenario, UK researchers and businesses would be able to apply to, and participate in all those Horizon 2020 calls open to third country participants from the date of exit.”Without full membership of Horizon 2020, the UK would lose access to money from the European Research Council (ERC), Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA) and SME Instrument grants, which are not available to “third countries”.The revelation comes after leading scientists voiced concerns about a chaotic exit from the EU and declared their support for The Independent’s Final Say campaign, calling for a referendum on the final Brexit deal.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor

scientists and the country’s ability to attract foreign talent.On top of a hit to UK science, the SME Instrument programme provides £143 million to small, innovative UK businesses, funding around 17 per cent of their research and development.The government has said it will step in to replace any lost funding if necessary, but the effects of third country status go deeper than monetary value, according to some experts. \u0026nbsp“Throughout my career I have had many, many grants, but none as transformational as the ERC grants,” said Professor Carlos Frenk, a cosmologist at Durham University. “Access to these grants to a very large extent determines where the very best researchers in the world want to go.”“In short, it’s a mess,” said Dr Mike Galsworthy, programme director at Scientists for EU.Besides the “chilling effect” the possibility of a no-deal Brexit is having on grant applications and hiring in the sector, he noted people who received EU grants were having to register with the government “just in case”.“So it’s devastation if it does happen, and just lesser damage, red tape and waste if it doesn’t,” he said.According to Scientists for EU, third country status would also mean UK researchers in European projects could no longer take leading roles, as the EU will not be willing to put them in charge of the money.\u0026nbspThat\u0026nbspis why Dame Anne Glover, president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, says it is essential the government arrives at some kind of deal.“If that doesn’t happen, there is a danger of us being a sort of lame duck, just looking at what the opportunities are and trying to become partners in research consortia without driving anything,” she said.The Tories’ plan for a no-deal Brexit is not looking so sunny any more‘Not realistic’ for UK to trade on WTO rules straight after BrexitDespite assurances, Dame Anne said she felt “we are really no further forward” with understanding the status of science after Brexit.“In March next year if there is no deal, the EU is not going to scrabble around to help researchers in the UK,” she said.“There may be an accommodation reached for a period of time, but there will be a hiatus, and research does not work well with a hiatus.”Professor Frenk added, unlike some of the predicted effects of a no-deal Brexit, the loss of scientific funds would not change the country overnight.“The effects won’t be seen tomorrow, they won’t be seen next year – they will be seen gradually over the years as we see a general decline in the scientific excellence of the UK,” he said.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as

targeted by some opponents of leaving the EU who believe his acceptance of Brexit stands in the way of the party signing up to a new public vote – a potentially decisive shift.The clash will come to a head at Labour’s annual conference next month, when up to 200 local party branches will attempt to make a further referendum official party policy.Now a leaked memo from the People’s Vote has told supporters: “This campaign is not about Jeremy Corbyn and we must not – will not – use it to damage or undermine the party’s leadership or attack them personally.”Penned by the group’s head of communications, Tom Baldwin, it comes amid growing confidence that there will be a showdown at Labour’s conference in Liverpool.The ruling body of the grassroots pro-Corbyn group Momentum will meet on Saturday to decide whether to canvas opinion, after more than 4,000 members signed a petition calling for a conference vote.The pressure illustrates a growing clamour from Labour members within Mr Corbyn’s base on the left of the party, as well as among many mainstream MPs.Pro-referendum motions are being considered by more than 200 constituency Labour parties and have already been passed for submission to conference by at least 13, Momentum says.People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration

backing a referendum, with both John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, and Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, insisting it must remain an option.Significantly, polling has found strong support among Labour’s target voters with 59 per cent of non-supporters who “might” or “would seriously consider” getting behind the party favouring a fresh referendum.Mr Baldwin’s memo, seen by the BBC, stresses that the tone of the People’s Vote campaign will be crucial to its success in winning Labour backing.May’s scramble for African goodwill on first sub-Saharan visitBrexit secretary contradicts

Brexit deal to the British people, while around 215,000 are backing the very similar People’s Vote campaign.However, the push was strongly criticised today by Andy Burnham, Labour’s mayor of Greater Manchester, who argued it would “deepen that rift” in the country.“My frustration with those leaping to a second referendum is it further inflames this idea of an arrogant political class which isn’t listening, and isn’t dealing with the issues that gave rise to the referendum in the first place,” Mr Burnham told the Politico website.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want

UK’s decision to leave the bloc – but vowed to protect the EU’s “integrity” at all costs.\u0026nbspThe comments appear to be a severe setback to Ms May’s hopes that the pair’s surprise talks earlier this month could achieve a breakthrough to rescue her beleaguered Chequers proposals.Significantly, No 10 had refused to say whether any progress had been made, at an island fortress off the French Mediterranean coast – beyond describing it as “a good meeting”.Speaking to France’s diplomatic corps, Mr Macron showed no sign of breaking ranks – in a speech in which he also lashed out at Donald Trump\u0027s “aggressive” isolationism.“France wants to maintain a strong, special relationship with London but not if the cost is the European Union\u0027s unravelling, he told the gathering of ambassadors.Brexit, Mr Macron said, “is a sovereign choice, which we must respect, but it can\u0027t come at the expense of the European Union\u0027s integrity”.Downing Street played down the implications, insisting: “We remain confident of securing a good deal that is firmly in the interests of both the UK and the EU.”But Ian Murray, a Labour MP supporting the People’s Vote campaign for a fresh Brexit referendum, said Mr Macron’s response had left the Chequers plan “dead in the water”.“It is filled with contradictions and can clearly satisfy neither her own MPs nor our European negotiating partners,” Mr Murray said.“Persisting with the Chequers car crash, and praying for a last-minute change of heart from the EU, is not a credible negotiating strategy. It simply increases the chances of a disastrous no deal Brexit.”And Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesman said: “The prime minister’s ridiculed Chequers deal has been given its verdict. It is a no in the UK, and a \u0027non\u0027 in France. It is \u0027nul points\u0027 from Macron.Theresa May is now fast running out of options, leaving the UK facing the harsh consequences of her Brexit mess.”Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria

European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union In France on 3 August, Ms May is believed to have issued a “Chequers deal or no deal” message, insisting she could not compromise further on the package thrashed out in June, which sparked two cabinet resignations.She turned to Mr Macron after a firm rejection from\u0026nbspMichel\u0026nbspBarnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, who ruled out both her plans for customs and for the UK to follow EU rules on goods but not services.Mr Barnier warned that Chequers would “undermine our single market which is one of the EU\u0027s biggest achievements” and insisted there would be no rethink.The government holds out hope that Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, is willing to be more flexible and viewed Mr Macron as the next – and probably toughest – nut to crack.However, last week, David Lidington, the effective deputy prime minister acknowledged that hopes of a deal by the original deadline of October are fading fast.Instead, an emergency summit is possible in November – if any progress has been made behind the scenes – or there will be a last-gasp push for an agreement in December.Campaigners for fresh Brexit referendum say don\u0027t \u0027damage\u0027 CorbynPlanes \u0027to be grounded\u0027 if UK crashes out of EU without aviation dealMay’s

need to be nailed down before Brexit day, but Tory MPs will strike down any agreement without progress towards an eventual trade deal.The Independent is joining forces with the People’s Vote to jointly stage a rally in London on 20 October, calling for a further referendum on any Brexit deal.More than 712,000 people have signed our Final Say petition to give the final decision to the British people, while around 215,000 are backing the very similar People’s Vote campaign.Brussels has hit back at the UK government, insisting it will not be to blame if no agreement can be reached because its negotiators are working “day and night, 247, for a deal”.Meanwhile, the government says it is stepping up preparations for crashing out of the EU without a deal, despite open clashes between cabinet ministers over the economic damage.Philip Hammond, the chancellor, has reiterated the Treasury’s warning of a 7.7 per cent hit to GDP and an £80bn black hole in the public finances, under a no deal exit.But Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, dismissed those fears, insisting most such predictions “proved to be wrong”.\u0026nbspThe Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want

religion","story":"Created with Sketch.The religion is banned in Russia, and labelled an \u0027extremist\u0027 group, akin to IsisClick to followThe IndependentAn appeal hearing at Russia\u0027s Supreme Court over the ban on Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses as an \u0027extremist\u0027 organisation on 17 July 2017Hundreds of Jehovah’s Witnesses fleeing Russia have applied for asylum in Finland, its immigration\u0026nbspauthorities have said.\u0026nbspThe Scandinavian country has become a favoured destination for the religious group\u0026nbspever since Moscow outlawed its activities last year.\u0026nbspThe denomination was labelled “extremist” in March, equating the pacifist movement\u0026nbspwith terrorist organisations such as\u0026nbspIsis. A month later, Russia’s Supreme Court upheld the decision and ordered the group’s official representation to disband. \u0026nbsp“It doesn’t matter where in Russia they try to worship – in their meeting houses, which the state is beginning to confiscate, or in private homes,” said\u0026nbspGeraldine Fagan, author of Believing in Russia – Religious Policy after Communism. “It\u0026nbsprepresents the worst roll back of religious freedom since the fall of Communism.” \u0026nbspIt is unclear exactly why the Kremlin chose to use its broad extremist laws against the movement. Initially\u0026nbspthe Russian Justice Ministry’s moves against the group appeared to be\u0026nbspa response to an aggressive leafleting campaign.\u0026nbspSome have suggested the group’s opposition to overt patriotism and violence played a role. The influence of the Russian Orthodox Church, which views Jehovah’s Witnesses as a dangerous sect, is also apparent.\u0026nbspIn the 17 months since the ban was enacted, dozens of Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses have been arrested. Most of an\u0026nbspestimated 175,000 members of the denomination\u0026nbspin Russia no longer advertise their faith. Many, it seems, are looking for new lives elsewhere.\u0026nbspAccording to the Finnish Immigration Service, the number of applications from Russian Jehovah’s Witnesses grew from five in 2016 to more than\u0026nbsp100 in 2017 and 2018. The number of asylum applications also grew, from 193 in 2016 to 309 in the year to date. The\u0026nbsplatter figure\u0026nbspincludes all kinds of groups – from opposition activists to refugees from the northern Caucasus.Finnish immigration officials told The Independent the vast majority of Jehovah’s Witnesses applications have yet to be processed. There had been only a “handful” of accepted applications and a “handful” of negative decisions, officials\u0026nbspsaid with nearly all of those rejected since appealing.\u0026nbsp“Each of the cases is dealt with on an inidual basis,” The Independent was told. “Persecution of these groups has not been systematic across Russia, and the approach of the ministry has taken this into account.”\u0026nbspWorld news in picturesA police officer walks by the front of a Chicago Pizza and GLHF Game Bar at the scene of fatal shooting at The Jacksonville Landing.

But that’s where we have got it so wrong.It comes as no surprise that nearly 50 per cent of UK schools are failing to achieve the target 25 per cent of A-level entries in STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The nation is crying out for STEM skills. It is estimated there is a STEM-worker shortfall of 40,000 — and it is set to rise. We are facing a national crisis.Yet schools are rewarded on delivering grades, not different subjects. And this relentless focus on grades means youngsters are potentially being deprived access to high-paid and fast-growing careers.Research shows interest in maths and science dramatically declines during secondary school.When it comes to gender, there is a big difference. Interest in STEM subjects drops by 56 per cent among boys and 74 per cent among girls.Quite often girls underestimate their performance and, although they get better grades in maths and physics at GCSE, fewer of them take the subjects at A level than boys.There is this perception that you have to be a genius to do maths or science, but that is not true.Often teachers will say unless you get a grade A in maths or science at GCSE, don’t even bother taking it for A level. The reality is, even if you get a lower grade in the subject, it is still viewed very well by employers. Even if you take just one STEM subject, it will open up so many more doors.This is one of the reasons I created Future Finder, a free app to show young people the relationship between subject choices and their career pathway.After all, this is about preparing them for a job, not getting them to the top of the school system.Science is also fun, it is creative. It’s not dull and nerdy, which is how it is often perceived.We need to tell youngsters there are such jobs as autonomous vehicle engineers, gamification designers and carbon capture technicians, because you can’t be what you can’t see.Sixty-five per cent of children entering primary school now will end up working in jobs that don’t yet exist. And unless young people are learning the right skills, they’re not going to get them.Nearly 30 years ago, when I set up a data analysis company with my husband Clive, people threw data away because it was too expensive to keep. We went on to create Tesco Clubcard, the world’s first supermarket loyalty card.We were only a small business, but we had the skills to figure out something Tesco couldn’t on its own — exactly what its customers were buying.It revolutionised the way we shop, the supermarket doubled its market share within the year and we went from employing 30 staff to 1,500.We were at the forefront of a new science and it was an amazing time.I’m incredibly lucky and I’ve had a brilliant career. Now I want to help give back by preparing tomorrow’s talent.I was the chair of Your Life, a national campaign to encourage youngsters to consider careers in STEM.As a result of that movement, the Government now gives schools an additional £600 per pupil studying maths at A level.Figures also show that STEM subjects are becoming more popular. More than a third of all A-level entries in 2018 were in these subjects and more girls are taking STEM subjects.But we are already far behind countries such as America and China. That gap is only going to get wider too, as we estimate we will need 1.3million more science professionals by 2030.If schools are the talent factory then we need to deliver the skills the nation needs. We must start by giving extra weighting to maths and physics when it comes to measuring a school’s success.We are defined by the talent coming through our schools. That’s our future, that’s who we will be.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And since 2000 our population has soared by more than seven million — more than 80 per cent of it directly due to immigration, according to Migration Watch.The Sun is not criticising the migrants themselves. Quite the reverse. The vast majority come for a better life and a decent job and integrate perfectly.Our objection is to short-sighted politicians who failed to foresee the cost.Now wages are depressed, houses and rents unaffordable, schools overcrowded, the NHS and our transport system under massive strain.Migrant numbers should be tied to our economic need — but it is vital, with the annual net increase still at 280,000, that we build the infrastructure to match.What’s being done? Precious little.WHAT credibility can Labour’s promises over the freedom of the media possibly have when their single biggest financial backer is the odious Max Mosley?Leave aside that he is a former fascist who was present as his father Oswald’s thugs marched through a Jewish area of East London chanting “Jews out”.He now bankrolls Corbyn’s mob, to the tune of £300,000 last year alone, because he knows they will try to crush the popular Press given the chance. His apparent sole motivation being revenge after his lust for Germanic sado-masochistic hooker orgies was exposed.This, then, is the rancid state of Labour:A cesspit of a party, run by public schoolboy Marxist class warriors, infested with anti-Semitic racism and funded by one of the most unimaginably unpleasant individuals in public life.How proud its MPs must be.IT’S far too easy for banks to blame ­customers conned out of their savings.Most of us are still too savvy to give our details to cold-callers or emailers. But the scams grow more and more credible and sophisticated. It’s easier than ever to be taken in and plenty are.The Financial Ombudsman argues that it’s unfair to assume victims are “grossly negligent”, and we agree.The onus must be on banks to beef up their security processes and software to keep our funds safe — as well as to keep hammering home to all customers the risk in handing over information.Last year only a quarter of the £240million stolen got refunded.That represents a shameful shirking of responsibility.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Corbyn’s speech was full of cuddly sounding expressions.But the real message was clear: Never mind all that freedom nonsense — let’s nationalise the news.So, the Labour leader says he wants to invest taxes in public-interest journalism.Who would want journalism that goes against the public good?But the question is: Who decides what the public interest might mean?Government ministers? High court judges? Simon Cowell and Cheryl? Jeremy Corbyn’s press office?Look a little closer and it is clear there is no consensus on what qualifies as public-interest journalism.It is just an ethical-sounding excuse for imposing your own interests on what are really matters of personal taste and political preference.One thing seems certain: It will not be the British public deciding which sort of public-interest journalism taxes should finance.Corbyn wants his state-backed media fund to be “independent”.A buzzword that should raise the question: Independent of what?There are no independent angels floating above the grubby political battles below, with only the public interest at heart.Everybody has interests and agendas of their own.Labour’s independent media funding body would be another government-backed quango, stacked with placemen from the political and cultural elites.Corbyn had the nerve to protest that the media today is “unaccountable”.Yet his independent media board would be less accountable to the public than newspapers, which must respond to their readers who pay their hard-earned money for their newspaper of choice.As for taxes funding journalism to create a more informed public — informed by who, peddling which line?It is not hard to imagine the sort of information Corbyn wants the media to feed us, it would be like the old Russian Communist party paper Pravda.It is no coincidence that the Labour Party’s biggest individual donor last year was the odious, Press-hating Max Mosley.The Labour leader singled out something called the Bureau Of Investigative Journalism as an example of an independent outfit that should be given charitable status and tax perks.Would that be the same self-righteous bureau that prompted the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme to throw its ethics overboard a few years ago and falsely inform us that a Tory lord was a paedophile?Newsnight never recovered its reputation in the wake of the debacle.When Corbynites talk about wanting a more “diverse” media, one thing they do not mean is diversity of content and opinion. They want a conformist media that will report what it is told and not ask awkward questions.Even the BBC — bastion of the Remainstream media establishment — is too insolent for Labour’s tastes.If you want to see the real face of Labour’s attitude to journalism, just look at Corbyn’s smirking response to a Sky News reporter who asked him some straight questions about the recent wreath-laying controversy.His contemptuous reply basically said, “You have no right to know what I do or think” — in which case, neither do the mass of viewers.Labour’s track record gives the lie to any notion that it is interested in a more open media.The non-Corbynite deputy leader, Tom Watson, is an even more embittered Press-hater.Who does Jeremy Corbyn think he is, to be laying down the law on what a free Press should or should not investigate, and protesting to regulators when they report facts or express opinions not to his liking?Yet Corbyn’s quasi-Stalinist vision of State-approved journalism seems to go down well with his cultish fan club, who ensured that #ChangeTheMedia was trending on Twitter even before he spoke in Edinburgh.Perhaps they should more honestly have made it #ChangeTheMedia-OrElse.“Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or The Mail,” Corbyn claimed yesterday, “doesn’t automatically make it news.”If he had his way, it would be more a case of: “Just because it’s news, doesn’t automatically mean it should be allowed on the front page of The Sun.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Remainer sabotage? Or just another tone-deaf blunder?Either way, he left the Government looking even more chaotic than usual.Will No Deal happen? Consider this:Britain has offered “unconditional” security cooperation with the EU post-Brexit. In response, Brussels vows to CHARGE us to access its databases.They want capitulation, not a deal.JEREMY Corbyn’s sole motive in “changing the media” is to silence a hostile Press.The giveaway was when he attacked broadcasters yesterday for following up Sun stories. “Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or Mail doesn’t automatically make it news,” he whined.Could this be because recent front pages have exposed Labour’s racism? That IS news, as page one stories in the two biggest daily papers tend to be.Britain already has the world’s most vibrant media. Corbyn is feigning some high-minded interest in improving it. But the last thing he wants is it holding a future Labour Government to account.He detests scrutiny, as his tantrums sparked by tricky questions prove.As for his plan for a state-run Facebook rival, can you imagine anything more ridiculous or pointless?The ­Austin Allegro of social media, making ­gargantuan losses for taxpayers?And how about his “Netflix levy” to fund the BBC?Is there no limit to the costs he wants to pile on ordinary people?NOW, by contrast, is the time for the Tories to CUT taxes.There is depressing talk of a new hike to fund the NHS. But the public finances are in unexpectedly good shape, the deficit plummeting and growth on the up.Corporation tax should be as low as Ireland’s, stamp duty slashed to get the housing market moving, fuel duty lowered, and income tax cut too.With No Deal Brexit more likely, we need to boost the economy and lure investment with a low-tax regime as never before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a horrible time.”In light of his apology, some people might talk about rehabilitation. He’s said he’s sorry and he won’t do it again.People have to be given a ­second chance — right?Before I answer that, let me flag up a few other stories that caught my eye this week.There’s the tale of Sean Simmons, 28, a domestic abuser from Hull who waterboarded one of his ex-partners, tying her to a bath before covering her face with a towel and pouring cold water over her, saying: “This is what I do to people who lie. I’m going to make you tell the truth.”Later, he produced a knife and said he’d “have to kill her”.And Darren McKie, a 43-year-old police inspector who was jailed for life after strangling his wife Leanne, 39, at their home in Cheshire, then dumping her body in a lake.And Glyn Leedell, 39, who threatened to kill a woman with a kitchen knife within hours of meeting her in a Rotherham pub.Oh, and the news that Ian Stewart, 57, who was jailed for 34 years after smothering his wife, children’s author Helen Bailey, is being questioned over the death of his first wife, Diane Stewart, who died after collapsing in the garden of the couple’s home in Cambridgeshire.I could go on, but it’s too depressing.If you read the same stories you may have taken a moment to despair that the papers are full of similar stories every day — of women being killed, brutalised and attacked by the men who purport to love them.Or, you may have barely noticed because these stories are so ­commonplace.Of course, not all men who threaten to kill their partners go on to do so.But you can be sure that most of the women above had probably suffered years of traumatic intimidation and abuse before their partners actually acted on their threats.Meanwhile, those women were ­living in fear — that’s what these chumps get off on. They want to make their victim feel helpless and powerless.So, let’s talk about forgiveness and rehabilitation.Do I think people who really regret being a perpetrator of domestic violence deserve a second chance? Yes, I do.If someone is genuinely ­repentant about anything they’ve done wrong, you can’t refuse ­forgiveness forever.Do I think that Dan Osborne’s second chance should take the form of a public platform on which to rehabilitate his image and, no doubt, earn a pretty penny or two into the bargain?No, I really, really do not.Sure, it was three years ago and no, he didn’t actually go on to act on his threat to knife his ex.But by letting him into the CBB house, Channel Five are sending a strong message that domestic violence allegations are a trivial affair, not to be taken seriously.By welcoming him in, despite his “scandal”, they are normalising and turning a blind eye to the kind of behaviour that too often ruins — and sometimes ends — women’s lives.People on TV are role models. And to allow a man who has made verbal threats to kill his girlfriend to become a role model is irresponsible in the extreme.ITV recognised this when they decided to boot him off Towie.Channel Five should have done the same.SHIRLEY BALLAS has revealed she weighs herself every day in the run up to Strictly in order to get “telly ready”.You might think that sounds extreme but, believe me, the only way to get telly ready is to take very seriously the old adage that the screen adds a stone.I don’t exactly weigh myself before filming The Apprentice or Give It A Year but, in the three months leading up to filming, I always manage to lose – by hook or by crook – a stone.In fact we all do – Lord Sugar and Claude Littner are watching what they eat as well.Then, as soon as filming stops, we all immediately put the weight back on again as normal life resumes.And, let me tell you, it’s a lot harder to take it off than it is to put it on.I’M a big believer in benefits being available to people who need help because they can’t help themselves.But the story of Bangladeshi immigrant Abdul Jalil, a father of six who came to the UK in 1969, really makes a mockery of the system.Jalil, who is 64, hasn’t worked since 1988 for “health reasons”.But a probation officer found the only problem he had is a slightly tender right knee.In 2008, he exceeded the amount of cash that claimants are allowed to have when he was loaned £25,000 to buy his council house.He did not notify the Department for Work and Pensions and continued wrongly claiming more than £28,000 over the next eight years.He then lied to the DWP about his assets as he filled out his benefits review form in 2012.He had re-mortgaged his council flat in May that year for roughly £148,000 and given the money to his children so they could purchase their own properties keeping around £86,500 for himself.Then at court this week he was spared jail – in favour of community service and even had the cheek to say he would do it if it was “light work”.I know that some people need benefits to get back on their feet, and I’m proud to live in a country that provides that.But once a person is back up, they need to actually stand on their own two feet – rather than abusing the system that helped them.Like all benefit cheats, he should pay the money back or go to jail and never be allowed access to benefits again.AS taxpayers we give almost £14BILLION a year away in foreign aid of which almost £1billion goes to the EU, and this week the Government was threatening to withdraw our cash if there was no-deal Brexit.Why wait until Brexit? Just stop it now.We need this money to fix our own country – our NHS, our police forces, our schools, benefits and housing all need it desperately.And the worst part of all this is that we have to borrow the money to give it away.Our country has almost £2TRILLION of debt, which costs around £50billion a year to service in interest.Borrowing money to give it away, it’s the economics of the madhouse.I KNOW our prisons are full, but it beggars belief that Allan Williamson, 45, was let off with a two-year community order and 30 days rehabilitation.When police raided his flat in Hulme, Manchester, they found more than 600 images – including 68 films classed as Category A, the highest level of children being sexually abused.To be clear, the images showed children as young as seven being sexually abused by adults.Still, Judge Elizabeth Nicholls,  decided prison wasn’t necessary, saying Williamson had been “open and frank” with the police about his behaviour and because the man has allegedly taken “tentative steps to address these issues”.So the guy was in possession of 600 images including many of the worst kind of paedophilia – and he’s still in the community?Who in their right mind would want this guy in their community?I know the prisons are buckling, so let’s just build more – even if that includes sending prisoners out to sea in containers.When is the justice system going to start thinking about the victims as opposed to the perpetrators?I BET the boyfriend of Kay Longstaff – the air hostess who spent ten hours in the water after plunging from a cruise liner – is feeling a bit embarrassed.Longstaff was miraculously rescued ten hours after falling – or jumping – from the Norwegian Star, 60 miles off the Croatian coast last week.It’s not quite clear what happened beforehand but other passengers and crew claim to have seen Ms Longstaff in several arguments with her partner Craig Rayment, above with Kay, on the evening of the incident.Once she’d been rescued, Mr Rayment’s estranged wife Kelly offered Ms Longstaff some unsolicited support, saying: “If I was on a ship with him, I would get off any way I could.”Oh dear.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

with this and accepted, regardless of the fact I have never fiddled my expenses or taken cash for ­questions, some of those who come before me have damned all politicians to the sin-bin.I do, however, think there is one very simple thing all politicians could agree to do that would help rehabilitate us to the public.We could answer a straight question with a straight answer.This week doing the rounds on Twitter was a clip of Jeremy Corbyn on Channel 4 News being asked six times: “Do you honestly believe Britain will be better off outside of the EU?”Each time he answered with a iation of, “Labour wants to maintain good relations with the EU to protect jobs”.His words are not bad — it is certainly the answer he and his team would have practised.But it is not an answer to that question and that’s the problem.To the average punter it just looks like politicians can’t be straight.The answer, as far as I’m concerned, is a big fat no.Gavin Williamson, the Defence Secretary, suffered a similar cringeworthy encounter with Richard Madeley in May.The question in the wake of the Salisbury poisonings was: “You told Russia to ‘shut up and go away’.Do you regret that now?Do you think it was too informal?”He started by answering an entirely different question about paying tribute to healthcare workers, which had absolutely nothing to do with what he was being asked.God only knows why he didn’t just say: “Yeah, it wasn’t my finest hour but I guess I was just really cross that people in Britain were being poisoned.”He could then have gone on to say all the nice things about Salisbury health workers.Instead, Madeley savaged him and all that anyone remembers of the encounter is that Gavin Williamson should avoid interviews.Mind you, at least both Corbyn and Williamson gave an answer.At least they bothered to take part.Boris Johnson would just have offered his questioner a cup of tea as if he was Mrs Doyle from Father Ted.I honestly despair.I’m not sure when the art of just repeating the same message over and over again, even if it in no way answers the question, started.Most people put it down to the Tony Blair years of slick media management, but times have surely got to move on.Politicians spend too much time hedging their bets, trying to keep all the people happy and end up pleasing no one by waffling through an answer that is basically six of one and half a dozen of the other.I get that it is hard when your job is basically a massive popularity contest, but I am not sure we are made more popular by dodging questions and refusing to give our own opinions.People contact me every single week telling me they don’t always agree with me but they appreciate that I stand up for what I believe.I honestly don’t think the British people want politicians to say an approximation of a safe answer, or to try to be pals with everyone.People have a damn sight more respect for people when they say what they think, even if they disagree.For too long politicians have been especially scared of upsetting working-class people, without recognising that most people don’t even think of themselves that way any more.I have absolutely no idea where the idea came from that the average member of the public can’t stand a bit of discussion and disagreement, or are so fragile that they will all fall apart if someone says something not to their liking.I have never once voted for someone who I agreed with 100 per cent of the time.I didn’t marry someone I agreed with a 100 per cent of the time and, frankly, if he tried to please me, placate me and pander to all my views I would no longer stay married to him, because it would be dishonest.Don’t get me wrong — saying what you think is not a universally appreciated characteristic and some do get in touch with me to tell me to shut up and go away.Much like Russia probably felt when Williamson said it to them, I pay little mind to this and crack on.Journalists do sometimes ask stupid questions.Politicians do have to be careful about what they say as it can sometimes get twisted and misrepresented.Things are not always simple, and giving a quick answer on a complex issue takes some skill.All that said, it has got to be time to stop the waffle and give the public a break from shouting at their telly each night: “For God’s sake, answer the bleedin’ question!”IT’S that time of year where slow news weeks turn to how much wine we should drink and if swearing at work should be banned.Apparently no amount of alcohol is safe, which will change absolutely no one’s behaviour, and swearing at work is bad for morale.I cannot agree on the swearing front.I am not advocating we all run around barking sweary orders and aggressive expletives at our colleagues but I find sometimes, especially in times of high stress in the office, nothing will quite explain it like a collective FFS.I have seen how a bit of good old Anglo Saxon can be used to break down barriers between me and my constituents.It stops me seeming like some lofty bureaucrat who cannot understand their problems.In some cases it makes them physically relax if we get a bit sweary about their crappy landlord or their benefits being stopped.We all swear, and most of us drink, I doubt that’s going to change.PADDY DOHERTY of My Big Fat Gypsy Wedding and Celeb Big Brother fame was in the papers this week, leading the funeral procession for his nephew.A sad affair, of course, but the diamond-encrusted funeral casket is reported to have cost £100,000.I remember organising my own mother’s funeral and balking at spending around £2,500 for an event I’d rather have not had to attend.I could hear her voice in my head saying, “How much?” as we wrote out cheques for cars and coffins. My wedding only cost £3k and I thought that was a bit much.When my time comes, I implore my family to keep their cash. I wouldn’t be thankful for money being literally burnt.THIS week’s, in fact this year’s, feminist icon goes to the unlikely Stormy Daniels.There is, of course, no reason why feminism would not extend to women performing in pornography but there are few crossovers.Stormy Daniels is a hero.World leaders across the globe pander to Trump, few are brave enough to publicly call out his racism, sexism and terrible decision making.Our own PM holds his hand, allowing him to make her look weak and feeble.Ms Daniels has been brave enough not only to take on the most powerful man in the world but also some pretty tooled-up lawyers too.After apparently receiving payment and signing a non-disclosure agreement to hush her up about an affair she had with Trump in 2006, she broke rank.This was not just a kiss and tell, this was a story that has caused Donald Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen to plead guilty to breaking election campaign rules.He explicitly stated that he was told to pay her the money by “the candidate” meaning Trump. Donald Trump will probably get away with this misdemeanour, but it is the closest he has come to being in real trouble.Without Stormy Daniels and her courage to face down legal threats, vicious hate mail and a campaign to discredit her, powerful men would continue to use women as playthings and just pay them off when they are done.Stormy Daniels is every woman who has been messed about and we salute her for fighting back.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Project Fear forecast dramatic downturns in the economy if the people were so unwise as to vote for Brexit. Wrong again.Since then, we have had record levels of employment, huge investments from the likes of Google, Microsoft, SoftBank and a long list of other companies.They demonstrated their confidence in the future of this great country in the best way possible — with their money.This time round the wise insight came from Andy Haldane, the best economist at the Bank of England.Ruefully he said “economic forecasting is having a Michael Fish moment”.Michael Fish was the weather forecaster who completely mispredicted the huge 1987 storm that struck Britain.If only economic forecasters were even as good as weather forecasters, we would be a lot better off. But they are not, and they are at it again.This week Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted the Treasury would need to raise an extra £80billion in 15 years’ time in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And yet the Chancellor insists on ­trotting out yet another bogus forecast, on the very day that my successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, is ­presenting the first set of preparation for no deal.Coincidence? I do not think so.The great departments of state are very careful about what they put in the public domain, and exactly when.For nobody is this more true than the Treasury, which has to judge the public perception of everything it does, if only because of its effect on the markets. So this was either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate. I know what I think.And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.It would not be long before our world-leading position in life sciences, gene technology, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and a whole range of other modern industries would be being actively undermined by the Europeans.As for being out of reach of the ­European Court, pull the other one.But now the Treasury is beginning to fear that even these spectacular concessions the Government has made in the Chequers deal will not deliver agreement from the European Commission — or if it does, the Commons will turn it down.In that event you can expect attempts by the Remainers in Parliament to try to scupper our departure by delaying it beyond the General Election, or offer some other enormous raft of concessions to give back control of the EU.Hence the ridiculous suggestion that the Army would be used to move food around the country.Why? What conceivable aspect of European policy would handicap British hauliers moving British products from Kent to Cumbria?None of course, but it was just the bogus nonsense some of our Remainer media is only too happy to carry ­completely uncritically. Similarly, we have heard suggestions of all sorts of shortages, based it seems mostly on the idea that the French might impede the flow of goods between Calais and Dover.It would not be the first time we had dealt with such issues. We had about 30 days of such delays in 2015. I remember queues of lorries, but I do not remember shortages of food or medicines.And on other issues, are the Europeans really going to pick a fight on data with the biggest IT power on the continent, on banking are they going to refuse to cooperate with the greatest financial ­centre in the world?Are the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards going to disadvantage the UK residents on whom many of their local economies depend? Or stop tourism? I think not.I suspect we are quite likely to have the odd hiccup when we leave the EU, but we will be able to cope, which is what Dominic Raab was demonstrating this week. And any problems we have will be over in months not years.So in 15 years’ time, far from worrying about Mr Hammond’s £80billion bill, the country will have trouble remembering what all the fuss was about.The biggest question will be whether we have made the most of the opportunities created by Brexit.And that is what we should worry about today, creating the circumstances where this great country can take its proper place in the world. We will only be able to do that if we allow ourselves the freedoms a clean Brexit will deliver.So my advice to all my old colleagues in Cabinet is simple: Ignore the misery merchants of the Treasury, stop fearing things that will never happen, and start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But leading Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg dismissed the “delusional”.He hit back at Brussels, telling The Sun: “It is wishful thinking by a EU establishment that has failed to notice that its grand scheme has failed economically, is devoid of democratic support and is increasing unpopular across the continent.EU sources also questioned Brexit secretary Dominic Raab’s upbeat assessment of how the UK would cope in the first few weeks of a no deal outcome. One said they “wouldn’t count on” his reassurance that Brits will still be able to enjoy a BLT sandwich in such a scenario.Last week the Government published a slew of notices warning people and businesses how to prepare for a crash out situation in March next year.Announcing them, Mr Raab dismissed suggestions the army and Air Force would have to be deployed to secure food and medicine supplies as “scare stories”. And in a bizarre pledge, he said Brits will “still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit”.But asked whether the UK Government could survive the first few days of a no deal exit, an EU ambassador told The Sun: “It’s not possible to have a no deal. There would be a massive outcry.“With even a no deal for one week, with no flights to and from the UK, no ships, imagine the economic loss of one week of no economic activity, no personal activity, no financial transactions. That would already be a disaster.”The diplomat added that Britain’s sluggish economic growth over the past year meant it was already “falling behind more and more” compared to the rest of the continent.The EU Commission has slashed its growth forecast for the UK to just 1.3 per cent for 2018, the joint lowest rate alongside struggling Italy.And EU officials believe that business pressure on Ministers to reach a compromise and avoid a crash out will crescendo in the next few months.A senior EU official told The Sun: “The moment the markets understand this is going in the wrong way, the cycle of negotiations and the political dynamics will be taken over by the real world.“In a few months the UK will have a credibility issue. The moment economic operators understand this is going wrong there will be events on the ground.”Meanwhile a former EU chief sparked outrage yesterday by claiming a no deal Brexit would trigger the break-up of the UK.Former European Council President Herman Van Rompuy said: “We could end up with a situation in which the EU27 becomes more united and a United Kingdom less united. This talk about a ‘no deal’ is the kind of nationalist rhetoric that belongs to another era.”THE Eurocrats are losing the plot.We’re used to their regular predictions that Britain will turn into the 10th circle of hell once we leave the EU. But even we’re taken aback by the ridiculous warning that we’ll have “no economic activity” the day after a clean break Brexit.These bizarre forecasts show the arrogance of those who rise to the top of the European tree.They genuinely believe that without their flag, their bureaucracy and their anthem that the continent will just fall apart.And it reveals their motives in the Brexit negotiations. To punish us, and send a message to anybody thinking of heading for the exit door – no matter how disastrous it is for the European economy.How are we supposed to negotiate in good faith? They can barely conceal their hope that the UK is going to slip into anarchy.The Government must continue to plan for a clean break. And treat everything Brussels says with not so much a pinch but a whole bucketload of salt.Meanwhile, for all their cocksure bravado, the EU is in all sorts of trouble.Unelected bosses in Brussels are in open warfare with the elected leaders of Poland and Hungary and are now fixing for a fight with Italy, too.Even the EU’s so-called ‘triumph’ in Greece will ring hollow to the 40% of youngsters there who are still out of work.Some ardent Remainers at home are still hoping that Britain might change its mind on leaving.But Brussels keeps proving that we’re better off out. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But despite this, the pensions are unfunded - meaning the whole bill has to be paid out of general taxation.Government liabilities for all exisitng unfunded pension obligations was a staggering £1.7 trillion in 2017. This is nearly as much as Britain’s official national debt of £1.8 trillion.The Taxpayers’ Alliance has called on ministers to stop raiding private pension pots and start funding public sector pensions to narrow the gap.Total pay in the public sector - including the value of pension contributions and bonuses, is on average 23 per cent higher than the private sector for comparable workers.Taxpayers’ Alliance boss John O’Connell blasted: “Workers in the private sector are paying for their public sector counterparts to enjoy a retirement they can only dream of, and that disparity has been brutally compounded over the years by politicians continuously launching raids on private pensions.“What’s more, pension promises made to public sector workers are unfunded and will continue to be paid out of general taxation - that is unsustainable as people are living a lot longer than when these schemes were cooked up.“To stop kicking the can down the road, reforms must ensure that new public sector pensions are properly funded and not paid for by the taxpayers of the future, namely our children and grandchildren.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It also has a small garden with lawn and decking and even a white picket fence.Guy Morse from Lillicrap Chilcott, who are selling the property, said: Its such an amazing place to be, right down by the beach. It has a very much oldie-worldy style.The beach is one of the best surf beaches in Cornwall and its also the longest beach in the county so these chalets have a real draw because of that.Theres a nice little community there, although its mostly driven by the holiday season, and Gwithian is one of the prettiest villages, it is set down behind the sand dunes and there are lots of lovely little cottages.A lot of the chalets only have glimpses of a view, unless theyre on the frontline and then you pay a premium.But this one happens to be well positioned as, although its not in the front row, it looks down the access lane and you can see the lighthouse, which is the thing people want to see. The prices have risen quite a lot in recent years, theres a limited number and theres always people waiting to buy them.Theres no reason why it cant be a permanent home, its being sold without any residential restrictions, but we expect most people will consider buying as a holiday home.The current owners have done a lot of work to it - plumbing, electrics, new kitchen, roof - so its in top order now.It also has a small garden, although really the sand dunes are your garden. Its protected land but with public access so its an amazing place to go dog walking or for children to play and its something you wouldnt find anywhere else in the county.That all sort of adds to the magic of it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429237033.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ufo landing pad argentinian desert","story":"Swiss man Werner Jaisli claims he was contacted by extra terrestrials who told him they needed a landing spot on Earth.The spectacular space terminal is a collection of rocks which form the shape of a star - known as an ovniport - near the small town of Cachi in the province of Salta.Jaisli is reported to have claimed to have constructed the site after he received a telepathic message from aliens telling him they needed a site to land on earth.He told Argentine newspaper El Tribuno: They landed about 100 metres above our heads and projected on us a beam of light that made us both see their own brightness.The funny thing is that it did not affect our vision.

They come over with dog treats and look after her, so one day I just said ‘why don’t you become Coco’s godparents?’“It started off as a bit of a joke but here we are. It happens in America, doesnt it, but it never happens in Merthyr, so I thought, why not?”At the ceremony, well-wishers applauded and later lined up to present their gifts to Coco and Elaine.The godparents, couple Debbie Smith and Emidio Franca, who live across the road, stood by like any other proud godparents at any other christening.The ceremonys acting officiant Karen Meyrick, who has been a friend of Elaine’s for around 23 years, said: “I have never done anything like this in my life – I only just found out today I’d be doing this!”Despite the obvious amount of love for Cocopops, Elaine admitted that she was previously never bothered about owning a pet.Mum-of-three Elaine, who works at Prince Charles Hospital, said: “My son’s dog had puppies and Coco was the runt of the litter. She was so little she could fit in your hand.“I said to my son, ‘Please can I have her?’ It’s been three years now.“I can’t imagine life without my Cocopops now. I absolutely love her.”Coco has been a source of comfort for Elaine in recent years following her husbands death.Elaine’s husband Colin died suddenly from a heart attack around eight years ago, aged just 46. The couple had been together for 28 years, and married for seven years.Elaine said: “He had a heart attack when he was 38, and then he died suddenly when he was 46. I was left in the house on my own and it was horrible.”Elaine presented Coco’s godparents with an engraved keyring each, marking the day.Godmother Debbie Smith, 56, said: “I fell in love with Coco when I first saw her.“We love seeing her, she came around for Christmas dinner last year. She was dressed up as Santa.”Although she’s only just been christened, a wedding is now on the cards for Coco, with Elaine planning a marriage with her neighbour’s dog Alfie in the coming months."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004292408281-e1535380868224.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"randy dolphin rubbing itself against swimmers sparks beach ban in french resort loved by brit tourists","story":"The mayor of Landevennec, in Brittany, has outlawed bathing and diving from the districts beaches whenever the horny animal is spotted.The move came after after the visibly excited three-metre  dolphin - nicknamed Zafar - rubbed himself up against boats and bathers.I issued the decree to ensure safety...

Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used to call out “Number 10, Wilson’s Den” in Great Yarmouth. He spent three teenage years in a Catholic seminary before, as he puts it, discovering women – so celibacy went bang out of the window. Now, he is reasserting his position as leader Jeremy Corbyn’s closest comrade. The Liverpool-born MP for Hayes and Harlington in West London is overseeing the party’s preparations for government, as they sense the Tories’ collapse is imminent amid an uncivil war over Brexit. “I had been saying pessimistically that the Tories would cling on to office,” he told me. “Now, I think anything can happen.” McDonnell is the architect of Labour’s alternative economic plan to boost living standards by ending Conservative austerity.  And he has lined up meetings next month with bankers Goldman Sachs and Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, as well as trade unionists Len McCluskey, Dave Prentis and Tim Roache to fine-tune Labour’s policies. The party’s plan to hike taxes for high earners and big corporations was a 2017 masterstroke that he’ll repeat in the next election manifesto. Once the fearsome “Mac the Knife”, McDonnell has recently morphed into a peacemaker. He’s demanding Labour stamps out anti-Semitism and appealing to pro-Europeans by leaving the door open to giving people a vote on Brexit. These moves were described by an ally as signs that McDonnell is clearing roadblocks to power.

But wait, it\u0027s not over yet, we\u0027ve got one last bank holiday to go and it\u0027s really worth being prepared for it. By this point, we\u0027ve all had enough of cowering from the heatwave sun so the end-of-summer cooldown is most welcome. That means it’s the ideal time to get out and enjoy some activities. Below we\u0027ve pulled together some great ideas for making the most out of the last bank holiday before Christmas... Get out on a family cycling adventure  If you\u0027ve been putting off taking the kids out to practise cycling, this last bank holiday is the ideal time to get out for a ride. Head out to some quiet woodland, or check out the Halfords widget below to find your nearest cycling route.   If you want to head further afield, then don\u0027t forget that it\u0027s easy enough to add a bike rack to your car.  The Thule ProRide 591 Roof Mount Bike Carrier  is \u0026pound75  and useful because you can add more than one to a roof rack - making it perfect for growing families. Halfords also sell a wide range of roof racks - and will fit them for you too. Enjoy a camping trip to Scotland  One of the great things about Scotland - aside from the stunning countryside - is freedom to roam. It means camping is allowed on public, unenclosed, land for no more than two or three nights. Your other option is to visit one of the many existing campsites across the country, such as at Loch Lomond Ardlui, Loch Ness Borlum, or one of the many along the coast Clachtoll Beach Campsite at Sutherland.  For camping, we suggest the Halfords 4 Person Double Skin Tent  which is now just \u0026pound40, save \u0026pound60, and takes just 15 minutes to pitch. If you\u0027re driving with all your camping gear, you\u0027ll also want to consider boot space.  It\u0027s surprising how much stuff you need to take the kids away for a couple of nights and you don\u0027t want to be uncomfortable in the car.  For added space, grab the Exodus 470L Black Roof Box Fully Fitted Bundle  from Halfords. It\u0027s \u0026pound389  and includes the fitting and a roof rack suitable for your car. Find the perfect spot for a picnic  Take a picnic out with you and you\u0027ll have everything you need for a great day out. You could even pack the Halfords Portable Gas Stove , which is now \u0026pound8 . But don\u0027t forget to pick up the correct Campingaz CP250  Gas Cartridge to go with it - these are just \u0026pound2 each or four for \u0026pound5.  Just make sure you\u0027re allowed to cook at your destination – many beaches only allow barbeques and small stoves after most people have gone home. It\u0027s well worth checking with the local council if you\u0027re not sure. Go on a great road trip!  A day trip or staycation break by road could be perfect for your family. Avoid queues by bagging a handy sat nav - which will also keep you on route and give you a pretty reliable answer to the \u0027are we there yet?\u0027 question. The Garmin Drive Sat Nav  - priced \u0026pound89.99  comes with lifetime map updates so you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road.  Also be sure to check your car is in good shape before heading out as there\u0027s nothing worse than planning a great bank holiday trip only to be thwarted by vehicle trouble. There are some simple things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, how is your car battery doing? Telltale signs that something is wrong include trouble starting the engine and lights that are dim when the engine isn\u0027t running - simple enough to check when you\u0027re parked up. Also, be wary that the hot summer months have a big impact on your car battery.

Andy Burns, 26, has taken to YouTube with a list of misconceptions people have about his disorder, including thinking he can\u0027t understand social interactions. He says he has even been accused of lying about having the condition because he doesn\u0027t look autistic. The young man, from Newcastle, says: Myself and many other people constantly have our diagnosis\u0027 questioned based on two minute conversations. Not all autistics are like Dustin Hoffman\u0027s Raymond from Rain Man - I get this comparison often and it\u0027s not an accurate reflection of me and other autistics.  Not all autistic people have \u0027special abilities\u0027 like people tend to think. Autism doesn\u0027t just influence the way I communicate, but how I see, hear and experience the world around me. He adds: For example, someone who is not on the spectrum could be able to go into a supermarket with no problems. But for me, I experience everything more intensely to a point where the lights are blinding, music is pulsating and people walking close to me becomes uncomfortable. Andy, an administrator, says he was bullied as a child for having autism.  He finds it upsetting when he hears of parents who are disappointed when they are told their own child has the disorder. In a bid to raise awareness, he has detailed five things you should never say to an autistic person on his YouTube channel Indie Andy . 1. Not all autistic people look the same Andy says: Autism has many faces and appears in many different ways - and there are different severities - For myself I am considered to be high functioning. I know general social norms and can act appropriately in social environments Someone who\u0027s low functioning may not have that social etiquette. 2. Everyone is a little autistic He says: It depends what context you mean. Mainly my understanding of this phrase is the social awkwardness and missing social cues. But you have many other things that come with it like stimming, sensory issues, social communication issues. I personally don\u0027t find it offensive but I do think there\u0027s a difference between someone being socially awkward and hardly making eye contact to someone who is autistic, who has real trouble making eye contact and communicating effectively.  3. Autistic people can\u0027t feel empathy He says: A lot of us feel emotion harder than someone who doesn\u0027t have autism and from my personal experience I have trouble being able to relate to someone\u0027s situation. This is just due to lack of experience with that situation in that time. I can understand how people feel most of the time but for me, I struggle to put myself in their shoes because if I haven\u0027t been in that situation then it\u0027s hard to imagine it. I feel like people misinterpret that as not having empathy. I know when someone\u0027s feeling upset about something - the first thing I ask is: \u0027Are you ok?\u0027 and \u0027Is there anything I can do for you?\u0027  do feel empathy but it\u0027s just not in a way that\u0027s conventional or ordinary or considered normal.  4. You must be really high functioning He says: This upsets me - just because someone appears to be coping in a situation - like being in a nightclub say where there\u0027s lots of flashing lights loud music etc - doesn\u0027t mean they don\u0027t find things difficult in other aspects. Just because you see me in a situation doesn\u0027t mean I don\u0027t have struggles of my own and it\u0027s likely I will have been in that situation many times before and that\u0027s why I seem ok. Explaining how the condition affects him, he adds: From becoming overwhelmed by small changes to feeling like no one understands me, it can be a struggle. I still struggle with unexpected change to my routine and environment today. I really thrive on familiarity and things staying the same.  But when there is change, I feel like my world is falling apart and this anxiety has led to a few autistic meltdowns in the past. Even as an adult, I still have meltdowns which involve emotional frustration, crying and just finding the smallest of tasks like competing in a marathon. BUT this is not my life 24/7. One of the worst situations for Andy are children\u0027s parties, because they tend to be very loud and messy. When he has an autistic meltdown he says anxiety sinks in and he can feel himself becoming snappy. I sometimes can\u0027t hide how I feel and it all comes out wrong, he says. My heart beats faster and it\u0027s like my heart wants to escape my chest. I find it nearly impossible to understand what people are saying to me and everything just becomes overwhelming. 5. You must be really good with maths, IT, numbers, binary code He says: This is simply not the case. There are autistics who do love maths and are good with numbers and code, however not all autistics are the same. Though we can have similarities in the way we show our symptoms, it is a very individual condition and the support that each of us may need will differ depending on the autistic in question.  Andy was diagnosed with autism aged four, but he said he didn\u0027t really become aware he had the condition until he was 10. He had started to notice he was being segregated from his classmates into a room with a group of people who had autism and learning difficulties. He says he also faced taunts from some other students over his condition, causing him to heartbreakingly ask his mum: Why am I different? He says: She explained the fact that I have autism but it makes me who I am. At first, I wasn\u0027t proud of the fact that I am on the autism spectrum. Like every kid, I just wanted to fit in at school and try to avoid the \u0027weirdo\u0027 label. But despite how hard I tried to fit in, most of my peers couldn\u0027t see past the label that I somehow adopted. I did have some friends who stuck up for me but most other students treated me quite terribly. There was the name calling, physical threats and general mental torture by saying that is was no good at anything etc.  All of this was pretty constant from what I can recall and even when I told teachers about it  it never stopped. I try not to think about because I was a different person back then. While Andy received a positive response from his mum about his condition, he says it upsets him to hear that some other parents are disappointed to find out their child has it. He says: Now I am not a father or a parent but being autistic does not mean that their child won\u0027t grow up to lead a reasonably normal live. I can only imagine that not knowing what your child\u0027s future will be like is a really intimidating concept. But with the right support from school, health and from family and friends, autistic people have the opportunity to live fulfilling and meaningful lives. I do think this mindset is based on a misunderstanding about autism and if you are not involved in that world is understandable. Andy says he struggled with dating when he was younger, but he is now happily settled with fiancee Nicola, whom he has been with for five years. The couple plan to marry in 2020.

The woman, who has not been named but has shared her story in her shock, is due to get married to her fianc\u0026eacute in Colombia this December. However her soon-to-be mother-in-law who is not her biggest fan is causing a stir by interfering with the wedding arrangements and has done the unforgivable with her wedding dress.  The woman wrote on Reddit : Future MIL is very upset about our destination wedding.   She thinks we\u0027ll all be murdered , b***hes constantly about the cost of her airfare, the size of the wedding, the guests that won\u0027t be able to come, the thought of my fianc\u0026eacute getting malaria, the fact that no one in Colombia speaks English...you get the picture. I try to limit her exposure to my wedding planning, though when I do this, she complains to my fianc\u0026eacute behind my back on how she\u0027s being excluded. The woman goes on to say how her partner\u0027s mum has criticised how extravagant her ring is - and that she needs to watch her calories as she\u0027s getting fat and won\u0027t be able to fit into her dress. However, the final straw was when she found her mother-in-law in her bedroom doing something disturbing with her wedding dress while she and her partner were putting up a bed in their guest room.  She explains that she left her to her own devices and to watch Netflix while they assembled the bed. But 40 minutes later, the woman went to the toilet and found her mother-in-law in their bedroom putting her wedding dress on - and she wasn\u0027t wearing knickers. Things got even worse when she saw her mother-in-law was stuck in it and had torn the sheer back of the dress, broken the zip and left a foot print on the train. The furious woman wrote: I asked her, as soon as I got her out of the dress , what the HELL she was thinking. She responded that she was just trying to make sure the dress would fit me because if the dress fit her, then it absolutely fit me too. If it didn\u0027t fit her, then I obviously had some work to do. Nevermind that I just had my final fitting and it had fit like a glove.

She and husband Jason, 28, had welcomed their little girl into the world at 11.50pm last Friday - but at 12pm the next day they were celebrating with Leanne and husband Sean. And little Rose only met her grandma 15 minutes before Rachael walked down the aisle. Rachael and Jason, of Newlands Lane, Workington, Cumbria, did not know if they would have made the wedding when the first-time mum went into labour on Friday morning, a week after Rose\u0027s due date.  But they said thanks to the amazing support of the super-nurses at Whitehaven\u0027s West Cumberland Hospital they were able to make the wedding at Sella Park Hotel, Calderbridge, where they also spent their first night as parents. Rachael said: Everyone was panicking and thinking we wouldn\u0027t be there, but the staff in the delivery suite were brilliant, they got me ready and made sure the baby was okay. It meant the world for me to be there, Leanne is my sister-in-law and I wouldn\u0027t have missed her wedding for the world. Jason added: It was really emotional to see Rachael coming down the aisle holding our baby at my sister\u0027s wedding. My mum only met Rose 15 minutes before the ceremony.  We\u0027d only had an hour sleep the night before, but we weren\u0027t tired because of the buzz. I had to rush home and get everything for Rachael to do her hair and make-up and everything for the baby and rush back to hospital so we could get ready. I didn\u0027t even know how to fold the pram, I had to look it up on YouTube. A 12-month countdown started earlier this year to decide the future of the consultant-led maternity unit at the West Cumberland Hospital. But Rachael and Jason said had it not been for the amazing support of staff at the hospital\u0027s maternity unity, they would have missed out on their special family day, celebrating both Leanne\u0027s wedding and the birth of Rose.

Upton Fish Shop has become one of Britain\u0027s most popular chip shops despite only opening six hours a week. Even the hour-long queues fail to put customers off. Owner Sally Shaw, 45, uses a 66-year-old batter recipe which attracts customers from miles around. The fish and chips are cooked in dripping in a huge coal-fired range - believed to be one of only two in operation in the UK.  People queue down the street in Gainsborough, north Lincs., when it opens on Friday nights and Saturday lunchtimes - and some even bring camp chairs to sit on. The takeaway, which recently celebrated its 70th anniversary, has had customers to fly into a nearby airstrip on private planes from across the country. It\u0027s popular with staff too, as one devoted staff member has worked there for 52 years. Sally, who purchased the takeaway at auction in 2005, said she can\u0027t believe the popularity of the 70 sq ft shop.  She said: People will queue all of the way down the street. I never get to see how many people are outside from behind the counter but customers will get to the front and say \u0027we have been in the queue for over an hour tonight\u0027. It is a regular thing, if someone tells me they have been queuing for half an hour I cheekily tell them that doesn\u0027t sound too bad.  Long-serving member of staff, Janet Gillespie, 74, jokes she\u0027s probably past her sell-by date by now, adding: I have enjoyed every single minute of it. The customers are all fantastic, they are like friends to me. I have never heard a bad word or complaint said about the shop, we treat everybody exactly the same whether they have been coming forever or it is their first time.   Is this Britain\u0027s most expensive pint? Hipster pub selling beer for 5 TIMES the price because of its very odd ingredients  Janet started work at the shop after making a pledge when she was eight years old to the previous owner. She explained: I told Mrs Longden, \u0027I want to work behind the counter here one day\u0027. It is the best decision I ever made. I have such a passion for it. I will carry on working here until I get thrown out, I will never leave.  My family joke if I\u0027m not at the chip shop on a Friday night, I\u0027m probably dead. The limit operating hours were used by the previous owner and Sally continued with them to keep everything the same. Sally said: I have known people come from Leicester, from North Yorkshire, from all over the place, she explained.  Some customers come every week without fail and many have been coming for decades. Customers have become so used to having to wait for their favourite meal they have created a system to work out how long they have left to wait.  Sally explained: The customers can work out how far away from the food they are by different points on the street. At one post they know they are an hour away, at another they know they are half an hour away.  It has become a bit of a social event, people bring their camping chairs and sit and have a chat while waiting.

Andy Godden, from Liverpool, passed away earlier this year aged 32 after suffering from bowel cancer for two years. His friends are now running the Great North Run in his honour and told of how their pal was determined to live life to the full despite his illness.  His friend Tom Loughlin, 31, help to organise the stag and told the Liverpool Echo: Andy and his partner Jess had spoken about getting married, but decided against it in the end - but he still wanted the experience of the stag.   Over the past five years a lot of our group of friends have had weddings, with us all going on about seven stag dos as a group. Despite not getting married Andy decided he\u0027d love to have a stag, so we planned a weekend in Manchester, with all his blokey mates. We stayed in a youth hostel and went to the football museum and a lot of bars. It was basically a celebration of Andy\u0027s life while he was still with us and it was the most amazing time. Tom, along with four of Andy\u0027s close friends, are taking part in the Great North Run to raise money for Bowel \u0026amp Cancer Research.  Their team name is \u0027The Runs\u0027 after one of the first signs of bowel cancer. The members of the team are Tom, Andy\u0027s partner of six years, Jess Lunt, 30, Elen Barfield, 30, Zoe Thirsk, 31, and Megan Key, 31. Before Andy\u0027s death, the group regularly completed challenges such as Tough Mudder, the three peaks and colour runs and thought the Great North Run would be a great next challenge. Andy had actually hoped to be there to cheer his friends along on September 9, with a few tears expected among the group as a result.  Tom said: By doing a half-marathon we want to raise as much money as possible to help people like Andy deal with the disease and prevent others having to deal with it at all. It\u0027s so important to raise awareness, it was something Andy was really passionate about and we want to continue that on. We didn’t expect him to go so soon, I thought we had more time. It will probably be a bit of an emotional finish.” "},{"url":null,"title":"family horror dementia moved away","story":"NewsFamily\u0027s horror as dementia sufferer, 89, is placed in bed 300 miles from homeDerek Jewson, who also has chronic heart disease, was transferred from Cornwall to Northampton - five hours awayShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAdam Aspinall21:02, 27 AUG 2018News \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A dementia sufferer aged 89 has been moved 300 miles away from home for treatment because of a lack of specialist care beds.  Derek Jewson, who also has chronic heart disease, was transferred from Cornwall to Northampton. The widower’s loved ones claim he was too frail for the journey and was admitted to A\u0026ampE shortly after arriving. Since the grandfather-of-five moved a week ago, his family have made the 600-mile, 10-hour round trip once. Mr Jewson’s son Kurt, 47, said: “Never in my wildest dreams did I think he would be moved out of Cornwall. Why was he transferred there? “He’s physically frail and was not strong enough to make the journey.”  Kurt says his father – a former politan Police motorcycle rider and lighthouse keeper from Porthleven, Cornwall – had been taken to A\u0026ampE in Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro before he was moved. Dad-of-two Kurt said: “He has chronic heart disease. He has water retention in his lungs and is struggling to breathe. “Why did they pressure him to travel the 300 miles within 24 hours of being in A\u0026ampE? He needs specialist nursing care in a hospital. “He arrived in Northampton and complained of pains so was taken to A\u0026ampE. We were told to expect the worst but he seems to have rallied.” “I have to look after the kids but he’s stuck up there in a hospital bed.  The Cornwall Partnership NHS Trust said it is “committed to providing care for people in Cornwall whenever it is safe to do so.

Birmingham Live reporter Stephanie Balloo decided to find out exactly what the family holiday camp is really like. During her trip, she found chewing-gum trodden into the carpet and saw dirty towels and empty crates of booze dumped in the entrance at the Brean Sands holiday park in Somerset. The choking stench of stale cigarettes filled an apartment and the toilet seat had been left broken with razor-sharp edges. It transpired a major mix up by staff meant she was given the spare key to a family\u0027s occupied flat, exposing all their belongings. One horrified dad she spoke to revealed images of what he believed to be \u0027human faeces\u0027 smeared on his paid-for bedding. Another told how their child had cut their feet on loose tiles in the swimming pool. Stephanie kept a detailed account of her short stay - here is her diary...  3.30pm: Popular destination with Midlands families The taxi driver tells me that Pontins Brean Sands is a popular camp with families from the Midlands. 3.55pm - Surrounded by caravan parks Driving through it seems there are plenty of other options for holidaymakers wanting to enjoy Brean Sands beach. The camp is surrounded by a number of caravan parks. I arrive at Pontins Brean Sands in a taxi and give my details to security who hand me a form to fill out. 4pm - Musty smell in chaotic arcade As I opened the door to what I imagined was a quiet reception desk, I was immediately plunged into chaos. Dozens of arcade machines all ringing simultaneously, children racing around and a musty lingering smell like an old-fashioned pub. One staff member mans the entire reception and I join the queue of around seven families - all waiting to check-in to their rooms as key collection starts from 4pm. The arcade carpet is stained with filth and blobs of chewing-gum are trodden into the disgusting flooring at reception.  4.25pm - Friendly staff The young receptionist is polite and friendly enough - calling me \u0027babes\u0027 and handing me a map with the route to my apartment. She also explains how I\u0027ll have to put at least \u0026pound5 of electricity into the meter on top of the \u0026pound139 I paid for two nights in a one-bed apartment. There is no Wifi apart from in the main building, I discover. I was directed to the fun factory to find out what entertainment the night had in store for me. Surprisingly, it seems quite an extensive list, despite previous complaints from families there is nothing for the kids. Though judging by the week\u0027s schedule, the entertainment is largely the same every night, with a Pontins character kicking off the evening, different Blue Coats performing and a disco to finish.  4.40pm - Cigarette butts and litter Walking through the holiday park to my allocated apartment I realise the reception isn\u0027t the only filthy area. Cigarette butts and rubbish is dumped all over the park - especially near the benches outside the main entrance. En route to my accommodation, I passed a neglected skate park, a strangely quiet adventure play area and a Nisa Local. The grassy areas around the play parks - dotted within the accommodation - were littered with discarded cigarettes as well.  4.45pm - \u0027Sick\u0027 on the steps I\u0027m first greeted to my apartment block with the sight of what appears to be someone\u0027s vomit. I try to dodge this as I haul my suitcase up the steps. But nothing could prepare me for what I was about to experience.  4.46pm - Horrifying scenes at my apartment A full to the brim bin, burnt trodden-in popcorn and two damp towels - one strewn across the filthy corridor floor and another hung up on the rail. There was a empty crate of beer abandoned and a mug full of cigarettes and ash dumped on the floor outside too. And this was just the exterior of my allocated apartment. I was horrified but despite everything I\u0027ve heard about Pontins, I thought surely this can\u0027t be right. But from the window I thought someone had genuinely left my room in this state, so I double checked the door - number 60. And double checked my documents - number 60.  4.48pm - Spare key to somebody\u0027s apartment To my surprise the key worked, but as I tried to enter, a rubbish bag full of half-eaten food and cans erupted and spilled out - blocking the entrance. A blast of stale cigarette smoke hit me and I begged internally to escape this hell. Inside, soiled underwear appeared stuck to the floor, sausages in thick grease on the oven and a bowl of what I can only describe as green slime. I spotted a mobile phone and pairs of shoes and realised Pontins staff had made a very worrying mistake.  4.54pm - Displeased neighbour The guest next door tells me the people in number 60 have been staying there for days and have just popped out for the day. It begs the question, why was the apartment all set for me to check-in? Nevertheless, the neighbour doesn’t seem surprised and tells me lots of families have had problems. They’ve lost the plot running this place, she says, as she explains how her room had no running water and a broken TV. She adds that her fire alarm keeps going off too. 5pm - Room mix-up not \u0027uncommon\u0027 When complaining to reception about my apartment, the formerly chirpy lady now seems inconvenienced and replies agh okay before calling the manager. She explains that there is two sets of keys and suggests the family should have checked out. What may have happened was they were meant to have booked out but obviously the system hasn\u0027t updated that they\u0027ve booked an extra night or something like that. It doesn\u0027t happen too often. It\u0027s just that crossover - it has happened before though. She is unapologetic for the inconvenience caused, as is the manager - who says somebody had gone into a room they shouldn\u0027t have been in. He claims he was off to find out who they were and sort the situation. 5.10pm - New apartment damp and reeks of smoke I get my keys to the new apartment, no 61, and it is relatively clean save for the broken toilet seat with the sharp edges. The harsh smell of smoke makes me choke slightly as I enter and there\u0027s dripping damp all over the ceiling too. A bucket has been placed underneath to collect the condensation. Small yellow blobs stick to the inside of the bath, though I\u0027m unsure what these are.  5.31pm - Faulty smoke alarms sounding The smoke alarm has randomly started ringing and refuses to stop even though there is no smoke present. There\u0027s no way to turn it off and fifteen minutes later it is still sounding. I think it is time to get out of the room. But as I leave, I realise it is the whole block and guests are furious. They say it has been going off constantly all week in the entire block every time anyone tries to cook for their children. They claim Pontins staff have not done anything to resolve the situation. 5.45pm - Furious guest says \u0027never again\u0027 Reacting to the fire alarm issue, a guest staying in my block says it\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve ever been here and the last time too. Another guest says there was no water to bath his children and he entered the apartment to find other people\u0027s food still in the fridge. 6pm - Hidden costs Dozens of families have flocked to the fun factory as the evening entertainment kick starts with a paparazzi session with Chuckles the monkey. The bluecoats are admittedly very enthusiastic and seem to excite the children. There are huge queues of families waiting to see the favourable monkey mascot, but these extras for the kids all cost more money. It costs \u0026pound5 for the children to have a photo with the monkey while outdated cheesy 80s music plays in the background. 6.30pm - Litter-plagued leisure area There is litter everywhere and young kids are running around without a parent nearby. Towards the rear there’s an \u0027inflatable zone\u0027 consisting of just two pieces of equipment, but the kids seem to be enjoying it. In the leisure zone there seems to be plenty to do, with go karting, paddle karts, a play area with swings, an \u0027urban gym\u0027, a skate park, trampolining and the pool. However, all of which is outdated and will cost more money in the form of tokens purchased from the leisure centre.  7pm - Pleasant beach nearby Brean Sands is just a three minute walk and is perhaps one of the few selling points for the camp. The long stretch of beach is soft and clean, perfect for young children staying in the nearby Pontins.  7.20pm - Buffet on dirty plates The evening meal at the Queen Victoria pub for those who opt for self-catering is \u0026pound8.95 and consists of some salad, grated cheese, \u0027vegetable pie\u0027, cod fish cake and chips. There\u0027s also some sliced potato with \u0027mince-meat\u0027 underneath. Some of the plates have spots of food from previous meals clinging on and the food smells are a bit overwhelming. There\u0027s food squashed into carpet and on the floor and the dessert fridges are a mess. I force a little bit of food down but it is largely tasteless just like the squash which misleadingly brands itself as 100% juice.  7.35pm - Dirty fridges Dirty fridges full of bashed up bits of cake is the offer for dessert. Crumbs of pudding spill out from the fridges and onto the floor - ready to get squashed like everything else on the food hall floor. Though admittedly what was left of the pudding was surprisingly tasty.  8pm - Bluecoat entertainers The fun factory is packed out with hundreds of parents, young babies, toddlers and even teenagers. The blue coat entertainers are up on stage and encouraging the kids and parents alike to be silly - including dancing around like ious animals and being soaked with a water gun. Chuckles the monkey comes out on stage and pantomime style jokes are made, leaving the children in fits of giggles. Everyone seems to be having a great time - especially the children.  8.30pm - Staff selling toys During the performance, Pontins staff try to squeeze more money out of the guests by offering light up batons to the kids for a set price. There is also a shop at the front selling Pontins branded toys and another store at the side of the main hall. 9pm - Non-stop evening entertainment The entertainment is non-stop and as soon as \u0027party time with Chuckles\u0027 ends, the children are up on their feet once more dancing to classic school disco songs. The jam-packed line up is great to see and clearly has most people enjoying themselves. 9.15pm - Scantily-clad dancers as children watch With the children still present, the parents continue to drink and the adult entertainment begins. Female dancers in crop tops dance around the stage and sing loud rock songs in the \u0027I wanna rock\u0027 show. As the concert gets underway, the Blue Coats dance seductively as rows of children sit looking up at them.  9.35pm - Bouncers on patrol There are four bouncers currently manning the bar area and entrance for the fun factory. 9.45pm - Young children play while parents drink Children as young as around six play in the parks outside the apartment blocks with no parental supervision in the pitch black as adults continue to drink inside the main hall. 10.30pm - Chaos as fire alarm clears hall Families cling onto each other and ask whether they have all their belongings as they are evacuated from the building. All the while the children are screaming about their abandoned slush puppies and toys. Everyone is told to move away from the building after what seemed like a serious fire. However, it is believed a drunken guest had smashed the fire alarm.  11pm - Doors banging, kids screaming As I try to sleep, the bass from the main hall can be heard among children screaming and doors slamming shut. I\u0027ve brought my own sleeping bag after hearing horror stories of blood-stained mattresses and filthy linen. Every breath I take I am inhaling more and more of the lingering second-hand smoke which clings to the walls, furniture and very atmosphere of the musty apartment. 3am - Parents squabbling with children I was awoken to the sound of what I thought was a fight kicking off outside my apartment. As I looked out into the corridor, parents were arguing loudly with their children in the doorway to their room. The row lasted around an hour before they eventually returned to their rooms. 4.10am - Screaming girl The sleepless night in hell continues as I\u0027m woken by the short sharp scream of a young girl. It seems to have come from near the squabbling, restless family - who to my annoyance refuse to sleep. 8.45am - Average breakfast The Queen Victoria is fairly quiet and there seems to be no staff in sight. It is a buffet again, which is all the camp offers in terms of cooked food. Segments of oranges, a fruit cocktail, toast, cereal or the main fry up in silver trays are the options available. But the sausages are spotted with transparent blobs of fat which are chewy to eat. Nothing tastes fresh, and it is fairly average.  10.15am - Huge queues for swimming pool Around 50 families are queuing for the swimming pool and have been for more than an hour with their children in just swimwear and a towel. One frustrated child - who clearly doesn\u0027t understand time yet - says why are they not open yet, it\u0027s stupid. The families are forced to wait a total of an hour and a half to be let into the swimming pool for their turn. The long wait was due to no lifeguards being present at the pool. 10.30am - Rammed pool The pool is rammed full of parents and children - each with around two square metres to swim and play and yet more are piling in. It has a capacity of 120 people, which is far too many for the size of the pool, in my opinion. The much-anticipated Flume feature of the pool is out of action due to a technical fault.  11.30am - Child cuts foot on broken pool tile A young child is hopping around in her swimming costume and towel with toilet paper wrapped round a bloody foot. Her father claims she had cut her foot on a broken, loose tile at the bottom of the pool. In images it appears many of the tiles on the bottom of the pool are either dirty or missing.  11.45am - \u0027Faeces\u0027 smothered on duvet I speak to another unhappy guest who is disgusted by his experience at Pontins. He shows me images of what he claims are human faeces on a duvet supplied by Pontins for a sum of \u0026pound8. Their mattress, he reports, also had smears of poo all over it. The family, who have come from Cardiff, claim they waited from 4pm until 11pm at night for clean bed linen for their children to finally go to sleep in. He says 99.9 per cent of people are unhappy here and have complained too.  12pm - Claims of mice and second pool injury Another family, living at the other side of the park in the chalets, claim mice have chewed through the furniture in their room. While a third family say their child lifted one of the loose tiles above his head in the swimming pool after cutting his foot on it. 1pm - Haven is the Ritz compared to this A pair of unhappy mums - who brought their kids down together - explain how they had bought bleach to clean their chalet themselves. We got bleach flash, wipes, everything to clean as the smell was like rot, damp, festering bodies. We had a conversation last night saying overall there\u0027s plenty for the children to do, entertainment\u0027s fine, but the smell of cigarettes was disgusting. We\u0027ve stayed in a lot of holiday parks, Butlins, Haven and this is the worst. Haven is like the Ritz compared to this. 2pm - Same activities, different day On the surface, there seems to be plenty of activities for the children and the whole family in the day time including Curling, Cine Racing, a Disco Bingo and photo opportunities with Pontins characters. However, when dissected this is nearly exactly the same as yesterday\u0027s daytime entertainment. And most of which needs to be paid for on-top of the accommodation price. When speaking with families at the end of my stay, many say there is not much to do for the kids in the day - and every day is the same.

But have you ever wondered about the behaviours which tick off supermarket staff? One woman, who used to work for supermarket giant Tesco , has revealed her biggest work-related bug bears. Kent Live reports some of the hidden truths people may not know about the business.  1. The dread of asking for someone\u0027s ID - and then finding out they\u0027re 30 anyway Feel flattered I\u0027m asking you to prove you\u0027re old enough to buy that bottle of vodka, because I\u0027m not doing it for fun. 2. I know it\u0027s three minutes until we open, but I can\u0027t unlock the doors just because you\u0027re standing there You\u0027re early, that\u0027s great. But unfortunately when we open at 7am, that means 7am. I\u0027m sorry if it\u0027s raining, or you\u0027re cold. But looking at me with a face like thunder isn\u0027t going to speed this process up. 3. Huffing and puffing in the queue won\u0027t make me go any quicker on the checkouts I\u0027m not deliberately going slow - it\u0027s just busy in here. 4. The frustration of people gathering around you as you knock 30p off a pack of mince Those yellow stickers are coming out, and its like shoppers can smell them a mile off.  5. The mindless game you play trying to squeeze another box of dolly mix on the shelf so you can finally get it off cage We all know those huge cages can get in the way, but getting the products off them is the real task. 6.

The brave police officers were seen quickly moving through the ocean in a bid to rescue the \u0027fully-clothed\u0027 woman at Sandbanks, Dorset, on Saturday evening.  Eyewitnesses say the mystery female ended up three quarters of a mile - nearly 4,000 feet - out to sea after finishing a phone conversation on the seafront. She apparently walked into the water at around 7.30pm, as the sun was setting. She was brought out an hour later.  Footage shows eight police officers looking out to sea, into the distance, before two remove some of their clothes and wade into the water after the woman. The incident disrupted a wedding party photoshoot at Sandbanks, which is a haven for celebrities and has been dubbed a \u0027millionaires\u0027 playground\u0027. Eyewitness Peter Hirst, 54, claimed the woman had been drinking alcohol before she walked into the sea with her clothes on and \u0027disappeared\u0027. He said: “The woman was on the telephone and drinking alcohol.  “When the conversation ended she got up and walked into the sea fully-clothed - it’s shallow for a while and you could see her disappearing into the night. “She was about three quarters of a mile away when the policemen entered the water. He added: A couple had just got married and were having pictures taken on the beach at the time. Sandbanks is a peninsula where homes cost up to \u0026pound10 million and the average house price is a staggering \u0026pound664,051.

Most workers in Britain are entitled to about 28 days of leave a year.  But, with some strategic planning you could beat the system and more than double your holiday time in 2018.  Anyone who wants about two months away from the office, while only taking the allocated holiday could have done so - with some careful planning.  The system works by calculating days away from work around bank holidays and weekends, according to Instant Offices .  So here is how to make sure you get the maximum benefit when booking annual leave.  Note: This only works if you work a normal shift pattern with weekends and Bank Holidays off. Sorry everyone else. Here\u0027s what to do  Christmas Day fell on a Monday last year, so if you were a clever planner you\u0027d have booked off from December 23 to January 1 you\u0027d get a 10-day holiday for the price of just three days.  If you missed your chance, don\u0027t worry.  Over the Easter break you needed to ask your boss for March 24 to April 8 off work. That\u0027s a 16 day break but only uses eight days of holiday.  The extra days come from the bank holidays - Good Friday , Easter Monday  and the early May holiday  - plus the three weekends the period covers.  Alternatively you could have taken off the 24 days from May 5 to May 28 by using up just 14 days of leave because of the May Day and Spring bank holiday.   Missed those? Well this weekend you had another chance.  You could have a 9-day break from August 25 to September 9 by using just four days of leave.  Christmas is coming The final way to work to system in your favour comes at Christmas.  By using up just seven days of paid leave, workers can take off from December 24 and not have to return to work until January 6 , 2018 - a 16 day break.     If you\u0027re interested in how it all works, take a look at the instantoffices chart.

Chris Larkin, 63, was just 23 when he ran his first marathon in 1982 - when he weighed a healthy 13 stone. But after falling into a routine of fast food dinners and little exercise, Chris piled on the pounds and at his heaviest he tipped the scales at just under 40 stone. Now the dad-of-two has embarked on a weight loss mission and shed a whopping nine stone. And he plans to run The Great Welsh marathon in 2022.  Speaking to WalesOnline, he said: It creeps up on you. By the mid-90s, I was getting heavier and heavier. I was working as a sales rep and basically eating out of a petrol station all the time. I just didn\u0027t make time to eat properly. The scary thing is you can easily put on a pound over a month without really noticing. But a pound a month is a stone every year.  By 2006 he had reached more than 30 on the scales.  His daily routine involved little exercise and he spent most of his time behind a desk.  He rendered himself practically bed bound, saying that he was too big to get off the sofa. He said: I reached my heaviest weight in June 2016 - 37 stone. At that weight I thought my life was over, it was awful.  His weight loss started after one of his colleagues bet him \u0026pound100 that he could not lose three stone in three months. He tripled the weight loss expected of him, losing nine stone in a year. Chris now is taking part in a swimming challenge for Running Down for Dementia as he is unable to run due to a knee injury. He aims to swim 130km for the charity, after he lost both of his parents to the illness. Chris met his wife, Karen, online. She has endlessly supported his transformation and has lost 4 stone herself in the process.

Ryan Howarth struggled to consume anything other than the low-nutrition meal from the age of four and felt like eating much more would be like eating insects. The 21-year-old, from Andover, Hampshire, has Selective Eating Disorder, which left him eating chicken nuggets and chips for 90% of the last 17 years - occasionally being able to eat steak, sausage, pasta and sweets. When offered other foods, the cinema host felt like they were so foreign that they were impossible for him to taste. He even cried for 20 minutes when his mum asked him to try root vegetable mash.  The disorder saw him eat by himself, leave the room when everyone else was eating and have arguments with his parents His family kept reminding him about the health risks of his diet, which led him to finding a therapist who persuaded him to try out some other foods before even leaving the room. Within minutes, Ryan was eating a iety of dishes with no hesitation. He said: I used to just think that\u0027s what my life was. I just ate the foods I wanted to. The way I reacted when someone asked me to eat more was the same way most people would react if I asked them to eat an exotic food, like insects. It just felt so foreign to me. My family started getting worried that my diet could cause health problems later on in life.  When I was still in the room with Felix, I was eating a bunch of different foods without hesitation. Now I\u0027m eating so many different things. There\u0027s ones I like and there\u0027s ones I don\u0027t like, but I\u0027m basically testing everything out. It\u0027s amazing how I\u0027m enjoying foods I never expected I\u0027d like. I never thought I\u0027d like pineapple, but now it\u0027s one of my favorites. Just one month after he\u0027s been introducing these foods to his diet, Ryan already feels healthier. Before the switch, he had a low energy levels, took a lot of vitamins to make up for the nutrients he wasn\u0027t getting from his meals and ate a chocolate bar whenever he was feeling weak. Ryan said: It\u0027s amazing. I feel healthier and I feel like I have more energy throughout the day.  That was no way to live. I was eating candy to keep myself going. I had three cavities as a kid. Another thing Ryan realized after changing his diet was that his eating disorder had a negative affect on his relationship with his family saying he alienated himself from everyone and dreaded going out to restaurants. Ryan said: I never used to eat with my family. I feel like I was letting them down and I was also letting myself down. Now I finally know what it\u0027s like to sit and have a meal with my family. It\u0027s really nice. I always tried to avoid going to restaurants or only went to ones where I could order the few foods I liked. Now I can finally go out to eat with my family and have lots of different foods to chose from. His mum Christiane, 45, has noticed a drastic change in his personality since taking up the new diet.

Employees are said to love his cheekiness - but it\u0027s not Harry or Wills , nor is it young George .   Matt Smith, who plays Prince Philip in Netflix drama The Crown - which chronicles the life of The Queen - has lifted the lid in a new interview.   And he\u0027s revealed how much the 97-year-old Duke of \u0026shyEdinburgh is adored by staff - and is the secret favourite.   In the royal house he’s the most popular of all of them, Smith told Variety .   All the research I did found him to be brilliantly funny, very clever, very popular. If you’ve talked to any of the staff, Philip’s the one they all love really. I think more than a lot of them, he’s a bit more of a man of the people.  Smith , 35, also described how it is Philip\u0027s naughtiness and cheekiness that makes him so well liked.   Meanwhile, Philip reportedly scoffed at the \u0027ridiculous\u0027 suggestion he watches The Crown, Smith added.   Philip is said to have made the remark during dinner with one of the actor’s pals and said: “Don’t be ridiculous”. Netflix has confirmed the series will be back in 2019. Olivia Colman will take over from Claire Foy in the role as Queen Elizabeth, while Tobias Menzies will star as Philip.  Earlier this month Philip joined the Queen at a church service in Balmoral just months after he had a hip replacement.

Rachel Potter was diagnosed after getting lost while driving home from her dad\u0027s home, prompting relatives to urge her to see doctors. Now her distraught family say she is far from the woman they once knew - as she is unable to write or walk without help. Mum-of-one Rachel, now 33, received the devastating news in 2016. Her devastated dad, Kev Potter, 61, said that his daughter isn\u0027t the same person as she used to be - with the young woman now requiring visits from carers twice a day.  And he said the condition is affecting her relationship with daughter Brooke. Kev said: Being able to walk any distance now is quite for painful for her and her handwriting has been reduced to a child\u0027s scrawl. Doctors have told Kev that they believe Rachel to be one of the youngest people in the UK to have dementia. Her condition - Gerstmann-Str ussler-Scheinker syndrome - is a degenerative condition that affects the nervous system and gradually inhibits coordination, speech and muscle control. Former UK Border Force official Kev said: It\u0027s absolutely heartbreaking - we were absolutely devastated when we found out.  We can see the change in her. She\u0027s not the same person she was, she was a bubbling, outgoing girl with a massive circle of friends who loved working and socialising. She travelled all over the world. Now, she can\u0027t work or drive anymore. She\u0027s deteriorated rapidly, her mobility is decreasing all the time as well as her cognitive skills. She can\u0027t write properly anymore or cook. She has trouble with directions and finding her way. As time goes on her relationship with Brooke will be affected as the condition gets worse. Her world now is a few close friends, her family and her carers. The syndrome is a degenerative condition that affects the nervous system. Both Rachel\u0027s mum - who is divorced from Kev - as well as Rachel\u0027s granddad have had the condition.  Rachel\u0027s mum, June, requires round-the-clock care and Rachel\u0027s grandad died after battling the condition for six months. Now Kev is concerned Brooke too could inherit the syndrome - but she may choose to never find out, Kev said: There\u0027s a chance Brooke could have the gene too. She won\u0027t know until she\u0027s 18 and that\u0027s if she decides to have the test. It\u0027s a ticking time bomb in our family. Kev said Rachel\u0027s condition has created enormous pain in their family. Relatives first became concerned after she became lost while driving home from a visit to her father and stepmother. Eventually, Rachel phoned her worried dad in a state of panic, not knowing where she was. Kev said: We phoned her for hours and she didn\u0027t pick up.  Eventually she picked up and said she was in a pub in Wakefield. She was very upset and said she hadn\u0027t been able to read the signs on the motorway or follow the directions on the satnav and she didn\u0027t know where she was. From that point, we got in touch with a GP. It was only after the GP referred Rachel to a doctor at Sheffiled Hospital and then University College Hospital in London that Rachel\u0027s family were given the terrible news that she had Gerstmann-Str ussler-Scheinker syndrome. Now, the mum-of-one requires help getting in and out of the bath as well as cooking in addition to doctor\u0027s visiting her every six to eight weeks to do a series of cognitive tests. But despite the care and support she receives, Kev said that Rachel\u0027s condition is totally unpredictable. Kev said: Rachel\u0027s doctors compare her test results to previous tests to see if she\u0027s got any worse. They\u0027ve been brilliant. The condition is so fluid, it\u0027s like a wave. We have good days and bad days. We took her on a holiday recently and Rachel said she was walking to a shop which we could see directly in front of where we were staying. Half-an-hour went by and we didn\u0027t see her. We were starting to get worried so I ended up calling security who eventually found her after two hours. She was very upset. Rachel walked past the caravan after getting lost. There have been a few other instances when I\u0027ve taken her out and parked close by to wherever we\u0027re going and she\u0027s come out, looked at the car with me sat in it and walked away, completely lost. She\u0027s started shuffling quite a bit so it\u0027s becoming more difficult for her to walk.

Forecasters predict the balmy temperatures experienced in the UK throughout summer could make a welcome return - after a washout bank holiday Sunday. According to the The Weather Outlook, the mercury could hit 30C in some parts, while the Met Office said a “very warm” September is on the cards. El Nino - the warming of eastern Pacific sea-surface temperatures – is predicted to bring about a return of the hot weather.  The phenomenon boosts autumn temperatures in western Europe, according to a Met Office El Nino impacts map showed. The Met Office said: “Heat released by El Nino events typically drives a short-lived spike in global temperatures. “A region marked ‘warmer likely’ in El Nino conditions means a greater than 50 per cent chance that the temperature will be in the top third of temperatures observed in the season.” Met Office forecaster Emma Smith said: “Wednesday’s cold front sees rain break up as it moves south, but high pressure from Thursday sees most places dry with sunny spells. “We could see 24C by Friday and up to 26C as autumn starts on Saturday. That’s warm for the time of year, as average highs are only 21C.    “The pattern will continue, and temperatures could be into the low or mid-20s in spells until mid or late September, which is warm or very warm for the year. “The warmest and driest weather will be in the South and East, with the North and West seeing outbreaks of rain at times, but having bright spells also. “Bank Holiday Monday’s sunny spells up to 22C were a lot better than a wet and windy Sunday. “But temperatures are lower than previously so that impacts summer’s average temperature. We’ll have to wait and see where summer ends up in the rankings.” The Met Office long-range forecast leading into October also suggested temperatures would be higher than normal.

The Duchess of Sussex\u0027s friend Lindsay Roth asked her to take on the important role for her wedding back in 2016.  But Meghan was a bit nervous about one of her maid-of-honour duties - organising the hen party , or the bachelorette party.  She didn\u0027t like the idea of running around a city trying to get into clubs and wearing headbands of the phallic persuasion. So instead, she decided to organise a low-key stagette - and it sounds like it was really lovely.  Meghan organised for the two of them, along with their other pal Lucy, to go on a weekend break to Hydra in Greece. And it sounds like they had a great time sunbathing, eating and doing a few cheeky shots on the quiet island.  Writing on her blog The Tig, Meghan said: When my best friend, Lindsay , announced she and her beau would be tying the knot, the pressure I felt as maid of honor was immense.  Exciting, of course, but immense – especially when it came to a bachelorette party.  Because the thought of running around a city trying to get into clubs and wearing headbands of the phallic persuasion didn\u0027t seem very on brand for us, I opted instead to woo the bride to be with a more low-key stagette. Now splitting half her time in London, it was easy for Linds to have a European weekend jaunt – so along with our friend Lucy, we ventured off to the sleepy chic island of Hydra. It\u0027s a two hour ferry from Athens, and a little rock trapped in time with the only mode of transportation being bikes or donkeys.

The 24-year-old, wearing an army green jacket, killed himself after shooting rival gamers at a Madden NFL 19 video game tournament in Jacksonville, Florida on Sunday afternoon. Eyewitnesses say Katz was angry and snapped after losing an intense game and being eliminated from the competition. He was seeking revenge when he returned about 15-20 minutes later with a handgun. They said Katz - who has been compared to Sandy Hook school shooter Adam Lanza - had been acting weird, wore the same clothes on both days of the eSports event, and refused to shake hands and stared blankly after losing a game on Saturday. Who was David Katz?  Katz, 24, was from Baltimore, Maryland, about 750 miles north of Jacksonville. He was an avid video gamer and was well-known on the pro Madden circuit under nicknames or handles including Bread, mrslicedbread, ravens2012champs and ravenschamp, the latter two being references to the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League . But fellow gamers have said they noticed strange behaviour from him, including a lack of emotion and blank stares. In 2014, court records from his parents\u0027 divorce said he had significant medical problems and healthcare needs. At the time, his dad worked for Nasa and his mum worked for the US Food and Drug Administration, WBAL TV reported. In February 2017 Katz won a Madden 17 championship hosted by the NFL\u0027s Buffalo Bills - a tournament that included one of his victims, Elijah Clayton.  Katz was given a cheque for 10,000  and a Bills jersey with the name Madden Champ and number 17. An announcer said during one of the games: “You are not gonna see much emotion from our guy Bread. David Katz keeps to himself. He’s a man of business. He’s not here to make friends. To even get him to open up to talk to you about anything, it’s like pulling teeth, man. After winning the Buffalo event, Katz told ex-Bills player Steve Tasker in an interview: I think personally I\u0027m one of the better players. But fellow gamers had accused him of cheating and making online head-to-head games glitchy to gain an advantage. The FBI, ATF and police have been searching Katz\u0027s father\u0027s upscale Baltimore townhouse, and police in Jacksonville have located and seized his car. It is believed he had been staying at a hotel nearby. What happened?  At least a dozen shots rang out at the GLHF Gaming Bar at Chicago Pizza, which was hosting the tournament, at about 1.30pm on Sunday. Terrifying footage from a live stream on the website Twitch shows two young men playing against each other when the shooting starts. A red laser dot - believed to be a laser sight from Katz\u0027s semi-automatic handgun - suddenly appears on victim Elijah Clayton\u0027s chest as shots are fired. People begin screaming and a man says: Oh f***, what did he shoot me with? At least a dozen shots are heard as terrified gamers ran for their lives or hid amid the chaos.  At some point, Katz fatally shot himself inside the shopping centre as police raced to the scene. His body was found near the bodies of the two who were shot dead. In the aftermath, there is panic and confusion. A man appears to be in shock, repeatedly saying Oh my God, while another man tells a victim to sit down and asks: Where did you get hit? Eyewitnesses said families with babies were inside the venue at the Jacksonville Landing, a downtown marketplace on the St Johns River. Raheem Johnson, a cook at Chicago Pizza, told of the chilling moment he saw the gunman. Mr Johnson told CBS News that he grabbed two kitchen knives in case he had to defend himself, adding: Dude came in there to kill. It was rampage mode. Why did Katz target the tournament?  Eyewitnesses said Katz was angry after losing again on Sunday and being eliminated from the tournament. Fellow gamer Steven Jauski, who ran and hid in a toilet when gunfire erupted, told the Los Angeles Times that the gunman came back and “targeted a few people” before killing himself. Eyewitnesses Rico Martinez and Jais Long told the Tampa Bay Times that the gunman was nerdy and got mad because he lost. He went to his car, got a gun and came back inside and started blasting everybody, the pair said. Marquis Williams told the Tampa Bay Times that Katz was wearing an army green jacket when he shot up the venue. His girlfriend, Taylor Poindexter, said the couple watched the shooter take aim at his victims.  She said: We did see him, two hands on the gun, walking back, just popping rounds. I was scared for my life and my boyfriend\u0027s. A Chicago Pizza worker named Brianna told ABC News that Katz had argued with another gamer and gone to the back of the room, where he waited for a few minutes, before opening fire. Toshiba Sharon, a commentator on the tournament\u0027s live stream, was just a few feet away from Katz when the shooting began. Mr Sharon told reporters that the gunman was eliminated from the event and came back with a gun about 15-20 minutes later. Mr Sharon, who survived by hiding under a table, said Katz shot Mr Clayton first and then continued on firing. Police have declined to comment on the reason for the shooting. Detectives have obtained a video of the incident. Gunman was acting weird, wearing same clothes  Dennis Alston told Action News Jax that he and another gamer who beat Katz during the tournament are both still alive. He said: I felt like he was targeting, but I don\u0027t think it was the people who beat him. It seemed like it was premeditated. Mr Alston said Katz was wearing sunglasses and had been weird all weekend. He added: He didn\u0027t speak to anybody, even after we played, I beat him , I went to shake his hand and tell him good game and he just looked at me. He didn\u0027t say anything. He had on basically the same outfit that he had on the day before. Police said Katz used one gun during his rampage. It was unclear how he had obtained the weapon. Why is he being compared to Adam Lanza?  After Sunday\u0027s shooting, social media users drew comparisons between Katz and Adam Lanza, who killed 26 people, including 20 children, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut in December 2012. Lanza, a bullied loner who was mentally ill, shot and killed his mum Nancy before the massacre, and took his own life as emergency services responded to the mass shooting. Comparisons between Katz and other mass shooters were made as a profile and photos of the gunman emerged on Sunday. One Twitter user wrote: David Katz, Nicholas Cruz, James Holmes, and Adam Lanza all mass shooters, and have that scary hollow look in their eyes. Another added: David Katz — shooter in the Jacksonville Shooting — eerily looks a lot like Lanza the guy that did Sandy Hook. Who were the victims?  Two young men were killed and nine other people were injured by gunfire in Jacksonville. At least two people were hurt when they were trampled as gamers and spectators fled in terror. The two men who were shot dead have been named by friends as Elijah  Clayton, 22, and Taylor Robertson, 27. Mr Clayton, of Woodland Hills, California, was known by his Madden names True or Trueboy, and had reportedly won more than 50,000  in prize money. An EA Sports profile reads: Despite a rough season, True remains one of the best around and can potentially win it all when it\u0027s done. Mr Clayton was shot dead as he played against Wesley “Joe Rice” Gittens, who survived the incident.

What they probably didn\u0027t anticipate was Allyssa\u0027s three-year-old son Owen deciding to steal their thunder by dropping his trousers and peeing beside them. So romantic! As 33-year-old Kevin was down on one knee waiting for his partner to say yes, Owen clambered past them, pulled his trousers down and started to wee. Talk about upstaging them. As the person filming the romantic proposal starts laughing and alerts them to the hilarious mishap, Kevin turns around and exclaims: Oh my God, he\u0027s peeing, are you serious?

The Vietnamese vessel is the first to reach the Australian coast in almost four years. Locals raised the alarm when they saw a large group of people fleeing the crippled vessel at Cape Kimberley near the mouth of the Daintree River and make a risky swim to a beach.

Mia Murchison gave her last little breath on August 17 after battling a rare, genetic disease that robbed her of the ability to walk, talk, see or eat. She was laid to rest last week by her heartbroken parents, who drove her casket to her funeral themselves in their \u0027final family adventure\u0027 with her. Mum Peta said it was the saddest and most beautiful day. Mia, who had been diagnosed with Batten disease at the age of three, was a very happy and affectionate little girl who loved to laugh and smile. In April 2014, she was pictured donning a stunning \u0027princess dress\u0027 as she met the Duchess of Cambridge at a children\u0027s hospice in eastern Australia.      Then only four, the youngster \u0027tried to steal\u0027 flowers Kate had been given as she sat beside her mum at Bear Cottage in the Sydney suburb of Manly. In response, the beaming Duchess, who had kindly crouched down beside Mia and Peta, said she could have them. They then all had a giggle together. Kate, who was visiting the hospice with husband Prince William as part of their Australian tour, is said to have listened so attentively to the family. When Mia said the word baby to her, she replied: Yes, I have a baby, baby George, according to a post on the Murchisons\u0027 Bounce4Batten website . She also joined in singing as the little girl\u0027s younger brother, Toby, took centre stage and performed \u0027Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star\u0027 for her. The tot was said to be very excited to perform for a real Princess.  Meanwhile, Mia\u0027s dad, Hamish, was startled when William approached him in the hospice\u0027s garden and remarked: You must be Hamish, Mia’s father? The engaging prince also complimented Mia on her gorgeous dress. The family had their pictures taken with the royal couple by award-winning photographer Marieke Jongerius, who has volunteered for Bear Cottage. They were left with very special memories from the day. Mia, who was born in Dublin, Ireland, suffered from CLN2 disease, one of a group of disorders which are collectively known as Batten disease. As well as losing her ability to walk or talk, she had to be fed through a tube. Her family, who relocated from Ireland to Singapore and now live in New South Wales, have been dedicated to raising awareness of the condition.      They have set up the Facebook page Bounce4Batten , where they announced the heartbreaking news 10 days ago that their beloved Mia had passed away. A post on the page at the time read: Mia died this morning at home in our arms. So incredibly sad and beautiful. So very loved and adored. A later post, by Peta, revealed her bright shining star had been laid to rest. She said: Yesterday was the saddest and most beautiful day for our family. Mia’s casket had a simple wooden name plate that we will keep forever. I never thought you could like a casket but hers was so beautiful covered in flowers and so very Mia. I loved it. It was very special Hamish driving Mia to her funeral himself in his car with Toby and I - our final family adventure together with Mia. She added: I was never going to ready for this goodbye but it was heavenly and more beautiful than I ever could have imagined. So raw and honest. Our family all coming together to cry, laugh, sob and honour our little girl.  The most ethereal of flowers  are in Mia’s room. Pink ribbons and drawings by her friends pinned to her wall. It feels like we are being lifted up with all love pouring in to our little family. I can’t believe we made it through yesterday but we did and now we are looking forward to celebrating Mia’s life next Tuesday 28th August. Mia, who had been a healthy, robust baby who met all of her development milestones with ease, first had a seizure in August 2012 aged three. Before this, any slight behaviour changes or concerns had been explained by the \u0027terrible twos\u0027 and other factors such as the move to Singapore. But a month after the seizure, she suffered a second. Following ious tests, the little girl was diagnosed with idiopathic photosensitive epilepsy. However, her condition continued to deteriorate, as she suffered more seizures as well as language and memory problems. She also began to fall frequently and lost the confidence to walk down steps or run, her family say.  It was in May 2013, nine months after her first seizure, that she was diagnosed with Batten disease, which would go on to claim her life. She and her loved ones relocated to Australia to be closer to their relatives. And there, beautiful Mia marked her ninth birthday last month. She passed away only weeks later. Although it was short, the youngster\u0027s life was exceptional. She showed incredible strength, joyfulness and love to those around her. Her relatives are now fundraising in her memory. The money raised will go to charities chosen by Peta and Hamish - including Bear Cottage, where Mia and Toby used to happily play instruments, spend time with other children and make the most of the sun-soaked garden. A dedicated GoFundMe page reads: The love that Mia gave \u0026amp the joyfulness that everyone experienced through Mia’s life is her gift to us all. However in the six years since Mia’s diagnosis there have been countless supporters, champions, advocates, friends and professionals who have extended themselves for Mia and our family. We would like to recognize and support the organisations that supported Mia’s joyful life. It adds: On 17 August 2018, Mia gave us her last little breath.

The sexually frustrated bottlenose has been scaring tourists and locals by approaching them and trying to rub up against them. The 10ft-long male, nicknamed Zafar, had been hanging around the the harbour in the Breton city of Brest for months - delighting tourists and locals. Children in sailing schools were delighted when the dolphin would suddenly turn up and frolic around their boats, and Zafar sometimes let swimmers grip onto his dorsal fin and go for a ride with him.  But then a few weeks ago he changed as he moved south to the village of Land\u0026eacutevennec. While locals say Zafar hasn\u0027t been aggressive officials fear he is now getting too close to boats and swimmers alike, even in shallow waters, reports Le Telegramme. Last month a swimmer reportedly had to be rescued by a boat when the dolphin stopped her returning to the shore. But the final last straw appeared to come last week when the dolphin tossed a young woman bather in the air with its nose.

united new boy pavol safranko admits understanding the dundonian accent has been his biggest hurdle","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United new boy Pavol Safranko has revealed the biggest hurdle he’s encountered since arriving has been learning to work out English – Scottish-style.The Slovakian international was an instant hit in Tangerine as he scored a cracking debut goal in the 2-0 win at Queen of the South a fortnight ago.And from what he’s seen of Scottish football so far, the 23-year-old is feeling good about fitting in to life in the Championship with United.Having already switched countries successfully once when he moved from Dunajska Streda in his homeland to Danish outfit Aalborg last year, he did not anticipate too many problems with getting used to the culture here.Particularly as his language of choice in Denmark was very often English.“I was one year in Denmark and everyone speaks English and I thought this is good for me coming here,” he said.“But when I came to the training ground from Dundee for the first time, the taxi driver spoke with me and I didn’t understand anything.“I had to ask him two or three times to say again before I understood what he said. It was not a big problem because he was a nice guy.“I will try to learn the accent here and it will happen but when I arrived it was more difficult to understand English here than I thought it would be.”While learning to speak, or at least understand, Dundonian, Safranko will also be reading up on the opposition he’s going to face in the Championship, starting with today\u0026#8217s visitors Partick Thistle.For him, though, the most important factor being at Tannadice will be getting to know his team-mates and focusing on playing to his and their strengths.“I do not know Partick Thistle. I do not know too much about any of the other clubs, so we have to see some videos, play games, and after I can say something about our opponents.“I think this can be a good thing. You always have to start from the ‘us’, from what we will do and not think too much about the other teams. This is a good way to build the winning mentality.“It’s more important to learn about team-mates than the other teams. I have had three weeks training now, that helps.“And it is important that we are winning games while we are learning about each other. There are many new players here and we will get better as a team but we must win while this happens.”With that impressive debut coming down in the Dumfries, for most United fans today will be their first glimpse of Safranko.Giving them a preview of what to expect he’s told them to look for him in the penalty box. He knows that’s where his worth to the team lies and that is where he wants to spend most of his time.“I am a striker who gets into the penalty box. This is my area to play. Hey, I am not good outside the box – I know where I am and that is where I play.“I hope this is good for United and that it is where we will play. Then I can help the team and that is what is most important.“We were good in my first game and we were the better team first half, so we were attacking.“Maybe not second half but we won. I hope the second game will be even better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b7fd04af1b5a-836x564.jpg ","title":"elton ngwatala dundee players must trust each other to turn form around","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBelief is key for Dundee, says Elton Ngwatala, if they are to chalk up their first league points of the campaign.The Dark Blues will make the short journey to Perth to take on Tayside rivals St Johnstone in what has become a crucial fixture.The Dens men go into the clash stuck on zero points after two Premiership games keen not to repeat their slow start to last season.It took last year’s team until mid-September to register their first victory of the campaign – notably against today\u0026#8217s opponents, Saints, in a 3-2 victory at Dens Park.To repeat that, Ngwatala – one of the summer recruits – insists it’s about the players trusting each other to earn themselves a first win of the campaign.The Frenchman said: “Last week was, obviously, a very disappointing result for us but I think we have to look forward now.“We are back in the league matches and we have to start winning games, that’s the most important thing.“We can take a lot from the last game and learn from our mistakes. We will do everything we can to win but we have to score as well.“Obviously, we can do so much better than we have done.“Everybody in the team knows that but we have to improve and keep improving every week.“Now, everybody is on it. Everybody wants to do the best for the team, whatever the starting XI or subs, everybody wants to be part of it and we need that to be successful.”Before the 3-0 home loss to Championship side Ayr United, Dundee’s big problem was putting away the chances they were creating against St Mirren and Aberdeen.The defeat to the Honest Men has put a whole different spin on the club’s start to the season, however.Ngwatala, though, says there is plenty of talent in the current squad to create a positive twist in the story of Dundee’s season tomorrow at McDiarmid Park.“The first two games, I don’t think we deserved to lose,” he added.“That’s the way it is, though, and now I think we have to be prepared to fight every game.“As a team you have to give everything to get the win.“Even if we have to wait to score in the 95th-minute we’ll do that – you have to believe to the end.“We have to go there with confidence and express ourselves and do the best we can to get the three points.”And Ngwatala says the points will only be heading their way if they can work as a team and trust each other to get the better of their Tayside rivals – that’s the message from boss Neil McCann, anyway.“The manager has said we have to believe in ourselves, believe in what we can do and trust each other.“If we do that, we’ll get what we deserve.“It’s going to be a tough game – we have to treat this game like any other and prepare like we would against any team.“We must go there and do everything we can to get a result.”In those two league games, getting anything positive on the scoresheet was a big issue with Ngwatala the only Dundee player yet to find the net.He’s pleased to have got off the mark in goalscoring terms but would much rather have points on the board.“It was good for me to get the first goal so now I’m relaxed, the first is gone and I can carry on now.“However, I need my teammates to help me score and I will help them to do the same.“I want to score but when I do, I want my team to win, not just get a goal and we lose the game.“I want to help my team get points, that’s all I want.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ive loved every second and now i want more dan","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDan Jefferies “loved every second” of his first-team chance last season and has vowed to grab any chance he gets this campaign with both hands.The 19-year-old featured in the two final home matches of last season, as a substitute in a 1-0 win over Hamilton before starting the home defeat to Partick Thistle that concluded the campaign.The Welshman, who started his career in Swansea’s youth academy, joined the Dark Blues in January after leaving Colchester United and impressed in the U/20s team that narrowly missed out on the Development League title.He also grabbed a goal in last week’s Irn-Bru Cup win over Hibs Colts for the Dundee youth side and says he thinks he’s ready for another shot at first-team football.Though, he admits jokingly, he might have to calm himself next time he’s out on the pitch in the senior game.Describing his time in the first team last season, he said: “I loved every second of it – once you step on that pitch everything is mad, it’s crazy and you don’t know what to do!“You need to calm yourself down a bit but I’m buzzing to have played for the first team and, hopefully, I can get more chances this season.“I think I’m ready to make the step up.“With the players in front of me in my position, I’m always learning from them, they are always helping me and everyone around the training ground is helping me.“If I do get a chance this year, I’ll give my all and I think I am ready for it – I’ll definitely take it with both hands and I won’t look back.”As a centre-back, Jefferies certainly has plenty of competition to get through ahead of him.As far as central defenders go, the Dark Blues boast an array of experience – Steven Caulker being an England international and former Liverpool and Spurs defender, Darren O’Dea won numerous trophies at Celtic, Josh Meekings is a Scottish Cup winner and Genseric Kusunga has two Swiss league titles to his name.For Jefferies, that doesn’t pose an insurmountable hurdle but rather gives him an ideal opportunity to learn from players who have been there and done it.He added: “In training if you make a mistake, they don’t really get on to you, they encourage more than anything.“They want everyone to improve every day and because I’m young, I’m 19, I look up to the likes of Steven Caulker, Darren O’Dea, Josh Meekings and Gense – I mean, they’ve got some amount of experience.“I hope they can share it with me and I can move on with them.”After making the move north, Jefferies has settled into life quickly in Dundee and says the possibility of first-team football at a club with the stature of the Dark Blues was a big draw for him.“It was a quick six months at Colchester before the opportunity came about up here,” he added.“It’s a good club, I love it here, the people are friendly and I think I can learn more up here and maybe break into the first team.“The manager definitely gives young players a chance if he thinks they deserve it.“He believes in the youngsters and I am very grateful for the chance I had last season.“Hopefully, I can get more this year.“We play the same way as the first team and it’s all the same at Dundee so it’s not too much of a step up from reserve football but it’s older men with experience and you just have to put yourself about.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"midfielder stanton major dundee united worry for partick clash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tMidfielder Sam Stanton is the major Dundee United doubt for Saturday’s Tannadice clash with Partick Thistle.However, stalwart Stewart Murdoch and summer signing Callum Booth could be in the reckoning to make their first league appearances of the campaign.In the absence of club captain Fraser Fyvie, Stanton has been wearing the captain’s armband for the Tangerines.Though, he could be forced to sit out this weekend’s game because of groin trouble and, if that’s the case, there are concerns he could be out for some time.“Sam Stanton has a hernia problem that has come from nothing, so this is bad,” explained boss Csaba Laszlo.“He will try for these last two days of the week.“Hopefully, he will be OK and doesn’t need to stay too long out.”If that isn’t the case the fear would be the 24-year-old could require surgery but right now United are hopeful a week or so of rest after their victory at Queen of the South should have been sufficient to clear the problem.And the return to full training of Murdoch and Booth this week will add to Csaba’s selection options. Whether or not either is fit to start on Saturday remains to be seen.A swollen knee means Murdoch hasn’t played since the Betfred Cup tie against Alloa a month ago.Whereas Booth’s absence stretches back a few days longer, to when he picked up a knock at Ross County in his only competitive appearance so far.Just the fact both are back working normally, however, is good news for their gaffer, though he remains frustrated by the continued absence of winger Billy King because of a thigh injury.“Callum Booth has trained with the team and also Stewart Murdoch has trained fully with the team, so they are now fit.“Billy King is still struggling with this stupid injury that he didn’t even get from training,” added Csaba.“He hasn’t done one training session so far this season.“Last season he was one of the most important players for the team but he is struggling with this injury and it continues to affect him.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"simon not first dundonian to play for wits","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn July, Simon Murray joined South African club Bidvest Wits.Simon’s goals helped Dundee eventually stave off the threat of relegation from the Premier League when he played for the Dark Blues on loan from Hibs last season .His return to parent club Hibees for the new term was short-lived as he signed for the Johannesburg outfit, who play in the Premier Soccer League.However, it turns out Simon is not the first Dundonian to play for this club.Ronnie Mitchell, who is, perhaps, best known for his mountain of goals with Dundee amateur side Riverside Athletic, also had a spell with the ‘Clever Boys’, so nicknamed because of their ties with the University of the Witwatersrand.Dundee Junior clubs Ronnie also played for included North End, Violet, Lochee United, East Craigie and Broughty Athletic.Ronnie is a director of Dundee-based timber preservation and asbestos services specialists Intona Limited.He is a former pupil of Gilburn Primary School and Kirkton High School in Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"with former celtic man tony watt in form st johnstone have goals in them ahead of dundee clash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWith Tony Watt leading the way, St Johnstone look like they have goals in them this season.The former Celtic front man has netted five times and, with David McMillan, Chris Kane, Greg Hurst and Callum Hendry also all well capable of goals, the Perth side certainly have no shortage of striking options for their game at home to Dundee on Saturday.They also have a goal threat on the wings as Drey Wright and Matty Kennedy have already found the net this season.However, the top end of the park is not the only scoring threat Saints have according to their former defender Raymond Stewart.Raymond finished his playing career at McDiarmid Park after an illustrious campaign with Dundee United, West Ham and Scotland and he believes the Perth team’s full-backs, Richard Foster and Scott Tanser, offer a threat to Dundee.Raymond was no stranger himself to scoring from his right and left-back berths although most of his counters were from penalties.Raymond, voted 17th best all-time West Ham player in a fans’ poll, as well as being named in the best-ever West Ham XI, said: “Foster and Tanser are important players in the St Johnstone team as they both have good engines, they get up and down, and their delivery is good from open play and set pieces.“They are both a threat going forward and are capable of scoring goals as well as making them.“Foster already has assists to his name this season.“He is a good all-round pro who never shirks tackles.

time","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDons boss Derek McInnes today warned Celtic will be wasting their time launching another move for Scott McKenna.A £3.5 million bid from the Hoops for the Scotland international defender was knocked back by the Pittodrie board last week.The champions are understood to be considering coming in with an improved offer to test the Reds’ resolve to retain the 21-year-old.McInnes, pictured, insists any further Celtic approach would be doomed to failure as the Dons aim to cash in on a future “big ticket” transfer to the English Premier League.Any switch to the top flight south of the border cannot happen this summer as the English transfer window closed on August 11.However, the Scottish window shuts on Friday and Celtic have been warned off any late move for McKenna.McInnes said: “We have had a conversation with Celtic and it has been made clear and they have accepted that.“I have spoken to Brendan  and at boardroom level they have spoken.“It is difficult to me to react to another rumour that someone is thinking about putting in another offer.“We are not in a position where we need to sell or need to do a deal.“We want him to be a big part for us this season and hopefully he can be exactly that.”McKenna, who is contracted to the Dons until summer 2023, missed the 1-1 draw at Hibs through injury.He will be out until after the international break next month having suffered a hamstring tear in the 1-1 draw with Rangers.Celtic boss Rodgers criticised his defence after the 1-1 Europa League draw with Lithuanian side Suduva and is looking to strengthen his rearguard.However, McInnes insists McKenna, who was being tracked by Championship Swansea this summer, will go to a higher level than the Hoops.“McKenna’s market, for me, will be the English Premier League,” he said.“For me he will go to the English Premier League and we will get the bigger ticket on the back of that.“I am very confident of that.“It is not a case of if, it is when he goes there.”Aberdeen extended their unbeaten start to the domestic campaign to four games with a 1-1 draw at Hibs.The Easter Road side netted an equaliser with just four minutes remaining.Boss McInnes was left frustrated that referee Andrew Dallas failed to award the Reds a penalty in the first half for a foul by Paul Hanlon on Lewis Ferguson.McInnes confirmed he did not discuss the incident with Dallas after the game and had no plans to.He said: “Paul Hanlon had already been booked.“It was a genuine attempt for the ball but the referee is in such a brilliant position so credit him for that, for getting up with the speed of play.“But how on earth he doesn’t give that penalty – I have watched it back and there is no way Hanlon touches the ball.“He just comes through and takes young Lewis Ferguson down.“That is such a pivotal moment as it should have been a yellow card and a penalty kick. And two yellows make the red.“Coming away from home at such a tough venue that would have been a huge shot in the arm for us.“It was the wrong decision.“Every team gets bad decisions, but if he has seen what I did on the laptop I am scratching my head to see why he cannot give a penalty.”Aberdeen were within minutes of victory with a one-goal advantage earned by on-loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban, who returned from injury.However, McInnes was left frustrated at the late equaliser.He said: “When you go so close to the end of the game at a place like Easter Road and lose a goal late on there is that disappointment.“It is a hard one to take when you come to such a difficult venue and get yourselves in front.“We should have had enough experience and wherewithal to get the job done.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen concede late goal to draw 1 1 at hibs","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen blew a lead with just four minutes remaining as they were held to a 1-1 draw by Hibs at Easter Road.The Reds were heading towards a vital three points in Edinburgh courtesy of a first half goal from on loan Watford defender Tommie Hoban.However Hibs grabbed the equalizer their play deserved through a strike from substitute Jamie MacLaren in the 86th minute.Another player on loan at Pittodrie from the English top flight, Manchester United\u0026#8217s James Wilson, came off the bench in the second half to make his Dons debut.\u0026nbspWilson joined from the Old Trafford club on a season long loan but the 22-year-old was ruled out of a debut in the 4-0 BetFred defeat of St Mirren last weekend with an ankle injury.Aberdeen made one change to the side that destroyed St Mirren 4-0 in the BetFred Cup with the injured Scott Wright dropping out.Goal hero Hoban returned from injury that had ruled him out of the last three games.Right back Shaleum Logan also returned from a three match suspension but was named on the bench.The 22-year-old has signed on a one-year loan deal from the Premier League giants.Hibs created the opening opportunity in the sixth minute when Joe Lewis  blocked a shot from the left by Paul Hanlon.The loose ball fell to Martin Boyle who appeared to be bundled over by Andy Considine in the box. A strong penalty claim was waved away by referee Andrew Dallas.Moments later Daryl Horgan sammed a shot into the side netting.On the quarter hour mark keeper Lewis produced a superb save when Horgan raced onto a through ball from Lewis Stevenson and unleashed a vicious shot.Lewis instinctively pushed stuck a hand up to push it wide for a corner.Hibs were dominating the early phase and Martin Boyle broke down the right before shooting wide.Aberdeen threatened in the 30th minute when Gary Mackay-Steven delivered a cross from the left deep to the back post. It found Stevie May but his looping header was collected by keeper Adam Bogdan.Soon after Bogdan was again called into action when he tipped a powerful drive from the edge of the box by teenager Lewis Ferguson over the bar.Dons keeper Lewis again frustrated the Easter Road side in the 37th minute when Boyle broke through the defence on the left and raced in on goal.Lewis did well to block Boyle\u0026#8217s drive at his near post and push wide.Aberdeen grabbed the lead just before half-time when a corner from Mackay-Steven was headed back across goal by May. It wasn\u0026#8217t cleared and HOBAN hit a shot that Bodgan got a hand to.With the ball on the line the on loan Watford defender followed up his initial shot to force it over the line.In the 50th minute Steven Whittaker was allowed the time to shoot but fired a 22 yard effort well over.Moments later Ferguson curled in a 25 yard free kick but the effort was blocked by Bogdan.On the hour May curled in a 30 yard free-kick to the back post but it lacked the power to trouble Bogdan who easily collected.Manchester United striker Wilson came on for Frank Ross in the 71st minute.Hibs pushed for an equalizer with a Shaw shot blocked and sent behind for a corner.In the 79th minute Efe Ambrose sent a glancing header just wide.It came in the 86th minute when Jamie McLAREN fired in from close range after the Dons rear-guard failed to clear a low cross flashed across goal.Aberdeen: Lewis, Shinnie, Considine, Gleeson, Mackay-Steven, May, Devlin, Ferguson, Ball, Ross, Hoban.Subs: Logan ,

and Moray have been listed among the 14,300 extraordinary and unusual sights from around the globe.In Elgin, the seven-foot statue of Dandy Lion makes the cut as an eye-catching and eccentric addition to the town’s high street.In 2016, local artists were tasked with taking inspiration from the area’s past to form a new centrepiece for the town.The half-mermaid half-lion wears a top hat, monocle, moustache and a cane to represent the fashion trends of the early 1800s.And the statue’s name is a play on words, referring to the dandelions people once wore to signify they were looking for agricultural work.Fraserburgh makes the list for its “dedicated” Museum of Scottish Lighthouses.An 18th Century lighthouse built on a 16th Century castle is now a monument to the maritime beacons of the country.Kinnaird Head Castle and the adjacent Wine Tower are two of the best preserved structures of the ancient “nine castles of the knuckle” – a group of historical castles found along the Buchan coast.Lynda McGuigan, manager of the castle and lighthouse, said: “It’s fantastic to hear we have been listed – I’m delighted.“We are the only dedicated lighthouse museum in the country and we hold the largest collection of lenses in Europe.“It is also the first ever lighthouse on mainland Scotland – it’s a thing of great beauty.“The lighthouse and castle are both important to the history and heritage of Fraserburgh.”The museum recently received an award from the National Autistic Society for its accessible and autism-friendly experience.In Cruden Bay, the remains of New Slains Castle has drawn the attention of literary enthusiasts.The castle is said to have inspired Bram Stoker’s classic novel Dracula.Stoker’s visits to Cruden Bay and Slains Castle were used as a blueprint for Castle Dracula in the novel.Brig O’Balgownie features on the map for its medieval history and its now quirky reputation with Aberdeen University graduates.The bridge dates back to 1286 and is made from granite and sandstone.Lord Byron even paid homage to the landmark in his epic poem Don Juan.The poet recalls crossing the bridge with friends in his childhood.Today, the bridge has become known

share memories ahead of the demolition of their old building.The building, on Logie Place, used to be home to Middlefield Nursery, which has since moved to the Hub in Middlefield.The old building is due to be demolished as part of the £30 million Haudagain redevelopment scheme.Staff at the current nursery are hoping for a big turnout when the building is taken down on Monday, in what will be an “emotional” moment for workers.Marie Macdonald, who is the nursery manager at the Middlefield Community Project, which runs the nursery, said: “When we found out the time and date of the demolition, we thought that it was an end of an era.“With all the families in the area that have used the nursery, we thought that it might be nice to mark it together.”As well as people from the community, Marie hopes to take some current pupils to the site.She said: “We don’t have a huge number of pupils who were attending in the old building, but we do have a couple, so we were hoping to be able to take them down on Monday afternoon.”Marie added: “It’s for any other families, past and present – it’s quite poignant and it’s the end of an era for some people.“The Community Project has been running for a long time so we’ve had people messaging us with their kids now in their 20s.“We just want people to have that shared experience, because the whole community is changing, a lot of the community is being knocked down.“The project and the nursery has played such a big part in people’s lives and it’s the end of that, in a positive way.”Marie also expects her staff to be feeling nostalgic. She said: “There’s always going to be nostalgia for the place.“Our project co-ordinator has been here for a long time, we’ve got a member of staff who’s been here for 20 years, so it’s part of their life. I’d imagine it’ll be emotional.”The nursery moved from Logie Place into purpose-built premises within the Hub, on Manor Avenue, in January last year.According to Marie, the move has dramatically improved the quality of the nursery, with more children being able to attend, increasing the catchment area they can serve.Marie said: “Before, we could only serve Middlefield, but now we can take children from Heathryfold, Cummings Park, Marchburn and other places in the local area, so more people are really seeing the benefits.”The new facility has also improved the quality of care, she added.“It’s greatly improved the facilities that we have – it’s a purpose-built nursery and the space we have is much bigger, and it’s much more open plan,” Marie said.“We have better access to the outdoors – the doors open up into the nursery garden, which was always our vision, to give the children a choice.”Transport Scotland announced that the demolition will take place between 1.30 and 2pm on Monday.A spokesman said: “Transport Scotland is pleased to accommodate the request of Middlefield Community Project Nursery for the opportunity to visit the site during demolition of their former premises, which are part of the ongoing works being carried out in preparation for the A90/A96 Haudagain Improvement Project.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"gallery city turns out to celebrate aberdeen","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHundreds of people marched through the heart of Aberdeen this weekend.The Celebrate Aberdeen parade, which forms part of a whole weekend of events, brought together over 100 different charities, sports groups and other organisations.Can you spot yourself or anyone you know in any of our pictures?"},{"url":null,"title":"north east kids nursery praised by inspectors","story":"\t\t\t\t\tChildren are well cared for at a north-east nursery, inspectors said.Monitors from the Care Inspectorate watchdog visited Building Blocks Nursery on Milton Drive, Buckie, on June 26 and rated it “good” for care, support and the environment – the third best of six possible ratings.The nursery can look after up to 15 children aged two to five at any one time.“Children were being well- cared for, the kind and warm interactions of the staff resulted in them being relaxed and happy, promoting their overall wellbeing,” the report said.It added: “Children were able to move around freely and make choices in their play, learning together and on their own.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"north east service for vulnerable adults gets top marks from inspectors","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA support service for vulnerable adults in the north-east has been awarded top marks by inspectors for helping them make friends.Monitors from the Care Inspectorate watchdog visited Aberdeenshire Council Shared Lives Scheme’s adult placement programme and rated it “excellent” the best of six possible ratings – a rating rarely given.Based at Viewmount on Arduthie Road, Stonehaven, the service arranges for vulnerable adults to live with families and receive personal care, support or counselling either on a temporary or permanent basis.At the time of the inspection the scheme had 20 sets of carers and 26 service users.The report said: “The service achieved an excellent standard.

We fully appreciate the disappointment caused, but unfortunately this is part and parcel of running outdoor events in Scotland.”David Lawman, of the Stonehaven and District Lions Club, added: “Like any event, you’ve got to look at the weather. Through the week we were looking at the forecast.“We reviewed it and had a chat with the harbourmaster and he was also confident that is what we were going to get.“It’s the sixth year and out of the five years it’s the first time it’s happened.”The groups behind the festival will now look to begin talks on next year’s event.David said : “We’ve had such a good summer, it’s just unfortunate.“It’s just the nature of the north-east.“It’s a decision we had to take.

local authority’s education and children’s services committee said rising numbers at both Kellands and Strathburn Schools, along with the opening of Uryside School, has prompted council officers to look again at where pupils are drawn from.While the focus of the review would mainly stay on these three, the report says other changes may be brought in, depending on the findings of the review.The report also looked at the possibility of relocation of secondary pupils to the new £54 million Inverurie Academy, due to open in 2020.It says: “The replacement Inverurie Academy is being built with an uplifted capacity of 1,600 pupils.“This is largely to future proof the school for the planned development in the area over the next 15 years and beyond.“However, it also allows for the opportunity to reduce pressure on neighbouring secondary schools.”If approved, officers will work alongside school communities to see if relocation is a possibility.Meetings will be held with parents whose children could be relocated early in this academic year to gauge opinion.The issues raised by parents at the meetings will then be used to devise the proposals.These will be provided to the department of

recent additions Blair Yule and Jordan MacRae had netted.Sheran said: “I don’t know what the possession stats would have been, but certainly we had a lot of the ball and plenty opportunities.“Bit frustrating we only scored three but we’re just pleased to have got the win and another clean sheet.“Fraser Hobday  did have some great saves, but we needed to be a bit more ruthless in front of goal. We were maybe just choosing the wrong options or whatever. But we’re happy.”Of his scorers, he added: “It was Jordan’s  first goal for us. He had a couple of great strikes, the keeper had a couple of great saves off him.“So it was pleasing to get him off the mark.“For his confidence it’ll do him the world of good.“He’s just getting to know the boys. At a new club it takes time with new players.“The third  wasn’t a bad strike, but I thought the first was a really good move.“It was counter attack where Jordon  played in Blair  and Blair tucked it away really nicely.“That’s his first goal since he came back too. We played him a bit further forward today and he certainly revelled in that role.”The win continued Cove’s perfect start in the Highland League and was their sixth clean sheet in a row, despite resting veterans Eric Watson and Paul McManus as the twice-weekly games continue.Brown thrashed at a chance from 12 yards early doors at the Balmoral Stadium, before Adam Cross just failed to hit a shot inside Stuart McKenzie’s back post for Turriff on 17 minutes.Cove started ramping up the pressure on the visitors, however, with Megginson having a six-yard shot blocked on the line by Ross Anderson, before the prolific scorer saw an effort tipped round the post by Hobday.He rounded the keeper 10 minutes later, but was denied again by a block from the right angle, before Hobday made a point-blank stop from MacRae.The opener came on 41 minutes. Jamie Masson spotted Yule charging through, Turra tried and just failed to step out and Yule was free to slot it past the on-rushing Hobday.Turriff never looked like coming back into it after half-time, and on 71 minutes things were sealed.MacRae forced a block from Hobday at close range before sliding in to smash his second bite at the chance into the bottom-left corner.And on 88 minutes, a frustrated Megginson, teed up by Scully, leathered it in the top-left corner from the edge of the area.Turra boss Hunter, who thought the first goal was offside but conceded he sees Cove as Highland champions again this year, said: “We did all right for a young team, but their quality showed.“The players acquitted themselves well, for their first time on a big park, they had a couple of half chances.“I’m more disappointed the belief went in the second-half with our players.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeens shinnie in scotland squad for uefa nations league opener","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen midfielder Graeme Shinnie has been included in the Scotland squad for the upcoming UEFA Nations League opener with Albania at Hampden.The new competition kicks off on September 10, with the national side set to play Belgium in a friendly three days before, also at Hampden.Boss Alex McLeish has named a young squad, with Dons skipper Shinnie \u0026#8211 who made his Scots debut against Peru in June \u0026#8211 part of the 23-man contingent for both games.Goalkeepers:Jordan Archer Craig Gordon Allan McGregor DefendersJack Hendry Charlie Mulgrew Stephen O’Donnell Andrew Robertson Graeme Shinnie John Souttar Kieran Tierney Midfielders:Stuart Armstrong Tom Cairney James Forrest Ryan Fraser Kevin McDonald John McGinn Callum McGregor Scott McTominay Callum Paterson Forwards:Leigh Griffiths Oliver McBurnie Matt Phillips Johnny Russell \t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"peterhead boss hails big victory at albion","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPeterhead boss Jim McInally declared his side’s win over Stirling Albion “a big victory”.The Blue Toon stayed joint top of League Two with the 2-0 success at Forthbank.McInally’s men are still unbeaten and exorcised a disappointing defeat to Stirling in the League Cup at Balmoor last month.Stirling, expected to challenge for the title, are pointless so far.McInally said “It was a good win.“We could have played better, but we got a good victory against a team who are obviously down on their luck a wee bit.“It’s only a matter of time before they start winning games, so it was a big victory.”He described it as a “revenge mission” beforehand, and thinks the result of the previous match this term helped his team.He said: “The guys always are up for it.“We just tried to learn a lesson from the last game, be a wee bit tighter with balls up to  Peter MacDonald and stuff like that.“They dealt with that fine, but I think in general we started the game really well.“In the middle part they came into it and could have scored a couple.“When we scored, we never really looked back and saw the game out really well.“We should have probably scored another two goals.”Despite another three points and his side remaining at the summit of the League Two table as they chase promotion, McInally said it’s too early to think they’ve reached top form.He added: “You could think that, but then you look at next week’s fixture and we’re playing the team running beside us, Edinburgh City .“We just need to go into another big game.“Saturday was good for us.“We started as well as we have done, but we’ve still got a bit to go.“We need to improve even more.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ .energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK. The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight. It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man. Greta Cameron talked about the early years of the Oyster Bar, established on the estate in the late 1970s by Christina\u0026#8217s brother Johnny Noble along with fish farmer Andy Lane.Piecing together records from her father\u0026#8217s journal, estate records and blending these with the recollections of the people of the estate, Christina has created a remarkable piece of work.This book is not just about the Nobles, but the Ardkinglas community, the people who make it and have made it and the story of how they lived and worked.\u0026#8216I\u0026#8217m very pleased that so many people have come along today for our launch party,\u0026#8217 said Christina.\u0026#8216Ardkinglas is a place that is very dear to me, and the place and the people have contributed to making me who I am today.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure.

Consistency, however, paid off for Inveraray as they were crowned Grade 1 Champion of Champions across all five major competitions during 2018 \u0026#8211 for the third year running.In Grade 4B, a young Mid Argyll Pipe Band kept up the momentum started in May when they won the British title. Led by Pipe Major Craig Lang, they performed tremendously well all season. A fourth place finish in the world championship ensured Mid Argyll Pipe Band won the Grade 4 Champion of Champions title for 2018.Early excitement for the Mid Argyll drum corps \u0026#8211 when they were awarded the drumming Champion of Champions crown \u0026#8211 turned to disappointment by the beginning of this week when the Royal Scottish Pipe Band Association amended the result. The Mid Argyll drummers were tied on points with Lower Clyde Pipes and Drums across the season but the fact Lower Clyde got a better result on the day put them just ahead, leading to confusion.Craig Lang said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been a historic season for the band, being crowned British champions in May, then going on to win Champion of Champions on Saturday, an unbelievable achievement for such a young group.\u0026#8216Myself and lead drummer Graeme McMillan are immensely proud of every member. The work they have put in over last year has been admirable and  we hope we have given Mid Argyll a band to be proud of.\u0026#8217Pipe Major Stuart Liddell of Inveraray and District was pleased with his band\u0026#8217s result, commenting: \u0026#8216It has been another fantastic season for the band \u0026#8211 having been second in four of the five championships, winning the Europeans in Forres and securing the Champion of Champions for the third consecutive year.\u0026#8216The competition this year has been of a very high level and has been interesting to see four different bands lift titles \u0026#8211 Scottish Power , St Lawrence O\u0026#8217Toole from Ireland , ourselves  and Field Marshall Montgomery \u0026#8211 who have just been crowned the world champions for the 12th time under Pipe Major Richard Parkes, equalling the record set by the legendary Pipe Major Ian McLellan of Strathclyde Police.\u0026#8216It is great to be included amongst these great bands and the consistency is reflective of all the hard work that goes into it.\u0026#8217Elsewhere, in Novice A, Oban High School came second behind Dollar Academy.Kintyre Schools came an excellent fifth in a Novice B competition featuring 19 bands from across the globe.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"youth shinty takes macaulay centre stage","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/08/18, 3:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowPrior to the senior shinty Macaulay Cup Final on Saturday August 18, three Argyll and Bute district teams contested a round-robin tournament at the nearby rugby club.The tournament featured S1 teams representing Oban/Ballachulish, Mid Argyll and Cowal and Bute.Mid Argyll were up first against the Oban area team.

The Labour list MSP hit out as it was announced rail users traveling to Glasgow from Kilmarnock will have to shell out an additional \u0026pound55 for season passes. Regulated rail fares are set to rise by 3.2 per cent, in line with the retail price index rate of inflation, from January. That will see a season pass increase from \u0026pound1692 to \u0026pound1746. Commuters in Ayr would see an increase of \u0026pound78 from \u0026pound2452 to \u0026pound2530 for a season pass. Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles MSP said the rises are the last thing hard-up passengers need.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyScottish LabourGlasgowAyrKilmarnockEconomyTransportLockerbieKilmarnock NewsTransport ScotlandCheap travel"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"musical tribute concert honour loved","story":"NewsMusical tribute concert will honour loved onesFollowing on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie16:27, 22 AUG 2018NewsColin Price and Pauline Moriarty join together for the tribute concert \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA musical tribute concert will honour the lives of two well loved members of the community. Following on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month. Joan Price, a beloved trombone player, was tragically killed in a road traffic accident in January 2017 by two boy racers who are now serving jail sentences. Joan’s fellow band members wanted to do something to honour her memory and decided to organise a concert featuring all three bands which she had played for. Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out  as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out  supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out . It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7  are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine. And they both played in the World Championships at the stunning Pinehurst course, which held both the men’s and women’s US Open just a year later - won respectively by Martin Kaymer and Michelle Wie.  Pinehurst has also been pencilled in for the 2019 US Amateur Championships and the 2024 US Open. The pair’s dad, Craig, has always played golf and he helped get them into the sport. Craig, who played golf for Cambridge University, said: “They have always been interested in golf. “I took Fraser to play at a young age, and Freya’s first steps were when she got up to pick up her brother’s golf club! “I’ve never forced it on them though, anytime they play golf it’s because they want to, which I think is the key. “They aren’t just into golf though, Fraser plays rugby for Marr and Freya wants to play hockey for her school, and both of them swim.” "},{"url":null,"title":"rural-residents-are-hung-up-on-phone-box-use","story":"RURAL residents near St Boswells are open to suggestions after acquiring their condemned phone box.\nLocal campaigners in and around Longnewton hit out after BT decided to pull out of the hamlet.\nFollowing intervention from local councillor Scott Hamilton and members of the local community council, the phone box was sold to the community for \u0026pound1.\nFollowing a clean-up of the box as well as fundraising to give it a sustainable future, members of the community are open to suggestions for its use.\nGina Allen, chair of the Longnewton Community Group, believes it has been important to maintain the phone box.\nShe said: \u0026ldquoWe contacted our local councillor, Scott Hamilton, who alongside Ancrum Community Council helped with the purchase of this phone box.\n\"I am delighted that it all worked out and we are now able to unveil to the community our new purchase.\n\u0026ldquoGoing forward the residents of Longnewton have great ideas as to what they will do with the phone box.\n\"Today we are saying thank you to everyone who has contributed their labour, fund raised or baked a cake for our coffee morning.\n\"It\u0026rsquos a great little area and everyone has taken pride in the work we have achieved.\nThe phone box received an official opening last week accompanied by home baking and a barbecue provided by Grant Todd of Greenend Farm.\nIdeas put forward so far for its use include a mini library, a defibrillator or a bring and buy shop.\nCouncillor Scott Hamilton added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been great working with everyone seeing this project come together.\n\"It was one of the first things I did when I got elected as the phone box was so close to being taken away a decision that we couldn\u0026rsquot reverse.

benefits assistance service.\nIn November 2017 the council merged the customer, homelessness, and welfare benefits services to become one integrated department.\nNow, a petition signed by over 200 Borders residents has been handed into Scottish Borders Council, urging the authority to employ officers with a specific remit to assist benefits claimants in applying for welfare. \u0026nbsp\nThe petition further calls on the council to \u0026ldquoensure there are sufficient staff resources within Scottish Borders Council for maximisation of benefit entitlement in the Borders and to \u0026ldquoacknowledge the error made in not carrying out any public consultation on the restructure.\nThe author of the petition and chair of the Borders mental health forum, Jenny Mushlin, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom very concerned that at a time when the benefits system has become so complicated the council has changed its service.\n\u0026ldquoThere are now fewer welfare officers and they are all working across different services.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping this petition will give some understanding to councillors of what people are facing at the moment, and hopefully persuade them to hire more people in the future to help people with filling in of forms and other admin.\n\u0026ldquoThe welfare benefits service was a much loved service which really helped people and the changes were made with no consultation whatsoever.\n\u0026ldquoWe are calling for them to consult with people who claim welfare benefits as to what is needed.\nCouncillors sitting on the Scottish

prepared for ongoing welfare reform including the rollout of universal credit.\n\u0026ldquoThe Department for Work and Pensions expectation on customers to self-serve online has created increased demands on Council services to assist customers.\n\u0026ldquoPrior to November 2017 the equivalent of 1.7 welfare benefit assistants were employed to assist with basic benefit enquiries including form filling with customers.\n\u0026ldquoWe now have 49 customer advice and support advisors across a wider range of locations, with a remit to assist customers at the first point of contact with their enquiry whether they present in a locality office face to face, over the telephone or online.\n\u0026ldquoThese advisers already deal with a range of benefit enquiries and applications as well as

had been donated to help boost restoration funds for the village hall.The painting, in a battered gold coloured wood frame, titled Village in the Valley, by H Shapiro, priced at £50, caused much debate.It was decided that the village looked most like Glencoe and due to the absence of television aerials it must have been pre-1965.The artist’s identity opened another discussion, with Arthur Duff taking centre stage.Had the best known 1960s Shapiro, singer Helen, performer of 1961 chart toppers, You Don’t Know and Walkin’ Back to Happiness, been a secret painter as well as pop and jazz singer and actress?Had the young star, who at 16 gave the Beatles a support slot in 1963, taken a Highland break?It all seemed a bit unlikely but could have made the painting a bit more valuable.Clues to the painting’s age lay in the method of stretching the canvas. It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands iously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman  Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 .’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

Nicola Pryde, director of the nursery group, which is already open on Meadowpark and has another facility in Dunblane, Stirling, said that the new centre had been opened to meet demand as the town sees more families moving in.

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.

She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.

If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals .  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent .  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions  said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics  show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a iety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform , she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to  beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":null,"title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.  Pupils returned on Wednesday, with Ms Cook planning a series of assemblies to introduce herself to the students.  She said: \u0026ldquoI would like to make Knox Academy a flagship school in East Lothian \u0026ndash Scotland, potentially.  \u0026ldquoI want all young people to leave to a positive destination but be healthy and happy as they move through the school and really enjoy their school experience.  \u0026ldquoI want pupils to enjoy education in the widest sense, not just the curriculum but wider activities, and to develop as rounded individuals when they leave school to meet the demands of an ever-changing society.  Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.  She said: \u0026ldquoI found when I was at Trinity Academy, the headteacher and the senior leadership team were in the middle of the school. With an open foyer, you saw pupils pass.  \u0026ldquoI think it could be easy to shut the door and stay in the room. That is not what I want to do, I want to get out and about.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot really like sitting about, I want to engage with people.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.  Currently the school is undergoing a large-scale expansion, which is due to be fully complete in early November.  Ahead of the new term starting, a section of the extension has been opened, which will give access to six new classrooms.  More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.  Mrs Slowther, who has previously worked at both Knox Academy in Haddington and Ross High School, Tranent, felt it was a \u0026ldquophenomenally exciting time for the school.  The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.

North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy.

With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed.

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.

The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band. That was all down to Paul so I was delighted to contribute to his fascinating book."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage-tranent-judokas-shock-visit-from-love-island-star","story":"  Hannah Wood was stunned when Jack Fowler, one of the stars of the hit ITV2 dating show Love Island, walked through her door on Sunday.  Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!  Jack\u0026rsquos visit certainly lifted Hannah\u0026rsquos spirits as she now faces another agonising four to six months off the mat through injury.  \u0026ldquoI just fell awkwardly, she said.  \u0026ldquoI actually carried on which probably wasn\u0026rsquot a good idea, and then I got withdrawn from the European Championships.  \u0026ldquoIt was my first big selection which is why I was in denial about being injured.  Even with this bump in the road, Hannah is adamant to make it to the top.  \u0026ldquoI got into [judo] when I was five through my friends doing it, she said.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was about 12 I started doing competitions and this year I\u0026rsquove been travelling loads.  \u0026ldquoI went to Japan for a six-week training programme and trained full-time with the Japanese kids.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level. It is an honour that we have been shortlisted as one of eight finalists in this category."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/8469877.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"jeremy-hunt-to-visit-burma-at-earliest-opportunity-following-un-report","story":"  The Foreign Secretary described the report as \u0026ldquodeeply disturbing and said there should \u0026ldquonever be a hiding place for those who commit these kind of atrocities.

The council created the mission in March last year, nearly six months before a string of deadly rebel attacks on security and police posts set off a crackdown that drove Rohingya to flee into neighbouring Bangladesh.  More than 700,000 people are thought to have fled, according to UN estimates.  The team compiled accounts of crimes including gang rape, the torching of hundreds of villages, enslavement, and killings of children, some before the eyes of their own parents.

Minister for the UN Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon will use a speech at the UN Security Council on Tuesday to urge the international community to increase financial support for Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh.  Lord Ahmad, who is set to call for the perpetrators of ethnic cleansing to be brought to justice, said: \u0026ldquoThe UK is playing a leading role in bringing an end to this crisis. We need an international political consensus to bring the appalling humanitarian situation to an end.  \u0026ldquoBangladesh has done more than its fair share to help the refugees.

Ms Sturgeon said she agreed to the procedure covering ministers and former ministers in December 2017 but that while she was aware of the investigation she had no role in it.  Ms Sturgeon said that she was initially made aware of the investigation by Mr Salmond himself.  She said: \u0026ldquoAlthough I have been aware for some time of the fact of the investigation \u0026ndash initially from Alex Salmond \u0026ndash I have had no role in the process, and to have referred to it before now would have compromised the integrity of the internal investigation, which I was not prepared to do.  \u0026ldquoHowever, I was informed by the Permanent Secretary earlier this week that she had completed her investigation and that she intended to make the fact of the complaints public.  \u0026ldquoAlex Salmond is now challenging the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedure in court.

This would, of course, open the way for MSP and former MP Willie Rennie, currently the leader of the Scottish Lib Dems, to seek the bigger role.  When Sir Vince succeeded Tim Farron as party leader following the 2017 General Election, there was speculation that he had done so as a caretaker that his deputy Jo Swinson, the 38-year-old MP for East Dunbartonshire - who gave birth to her second child in July - would take over at some stage before the next General Election. This is due on May 5 2022, within four days of which Sir Vince will enter his 80th year.  Asked about the prospect of Sir Vince standing down as leader, a party source said: \"He\u0027s not about to stand down or use the speech to stand down. There are no plans to step down any time soon.\"  It is expected that the Lib Dem leader will at conference unveil proposals to create a registered supporters scheme, similar to the one that allowed 180,000 people to vote in the Labour leadership elections.  Rules will also be rewritten so that supporters will need to be enrolled for at least 12 months before voting, to prevent any infiltration or undue influence by rival parties.  Sources suggested that Sir Vince hoped to emulate the success of Justin Trudeau\u0027s Liberal Party in Canada, which introduced the changes and went from third to first place in its 2015 election victory.  A consultation on the proposed changes is expected to last several months.

Earlier this year, an evaluation described as \u0026ldquoexceptional a Glasgow-wide mentoring project for pupils with family difficulties.  The success of the MCR Pathways project has already seen it rolled out to Aberdeenshire and Aberdeen and an additional ten councils are signing up.  The Scottish Government also funds a mentoring programme for young people looked after at home called Intandem.  The Intandem website states: \u0026ldquoWe know how crucial it is for young people to have at least one long term relationship with a positive adult role-model.  However, Education Scotland\u0026rsquos guidance for schools on closing the attainment gap states: \u0026ldquoOn average, mentoring appears to have little or no positive impact on academic outcomes.  \u0026ldquoSchool-based mentoring programmes appear to be less effective than community-based approaches, possibly because school-based mentoring can result in fewer opportunities for young people to develop more lasting and trusting relationships with adult role models.  The report says some studies have found positive impacts for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, and for non-academic outcomes such as attitudes to school, attendance and behaviour.  But it adds: \u0026ldquoThere are risks associated with unsuccessful mentor pairings, which may have a detrimental effect on the mentee, and some studies report negative overall impacts.  Iain MacRitchie, a Glaswegian businessman who founded MCR Pathways, said different versions of mentoring had ying degrees of effectiveness.  But he added: \u0026ldquoWhilst there is some debate over how much research has been carried out on mentoring, there is no debate on the impact that a caring adult outside of the immediate family unit can have on our most disadvantaged young people.  \u0026ldquoThose in the care system can contend with considerable degrees of instability, uncertainty, distrust and trauma, layered with a lack of control, confidence, hope and self-belief \u0026ndash all through no fault of their own.  \u0026ldquoWhat we have found over 11 years working in the most challenging of city communities and circumstances is that mentoring can have a profound impact.  When contacted by The Herald, an Education Scotland spokeswoman\u0026nbspsaid the MCR Pathways project was delivering \"significant improvements\" in outcomes for those in care.  She said: \"That has been clearly shown by the recent evaluation of the impact of the programme in Glasgow.  \u0026ldquoThis finding is in line with the evidence in the ... toolkit. Mentoring programmes that have a clear structure and expectations, provide training and support for mentors, and use mentors from a professional background, are associated with more successful outcomes. The MCR Pathway is a great example of that success.\"  The MCR Pathways evaluation found the percentage of care-experienced young people staying on at school beyond S4 who were mentored was 79 per cent, compared to a national average of 36 per cent. The proportion going to college, university or a job was 86 per cent compared to an average of 50 per cent.  The report said: \u0026ldquoThe education outcomes are exceptional when mentored young people\u0026rsquos achievements are compared to national and Glasgow statistics for care-experienced young people.  Mentoring in education involves pairing young people with an older peer or volunteer, who acts as a positive role model.  Mentoring aims to build confidence, develop resilience and character, or raise aspirations, rather than to deliver specific academic skills or knowledge."},{"url":null,"title":"brexiteer-jacob-rees-mogg-criticised-after-suggesting-irish-border-inspections-post-brexit","story":"  Simon Coveney, Ireland\u0026rsquos Deputy Prime Minister, took to social media to say it was hard to believe such a senior British politician could be \u0026ldquoso ill-informed as to make such comments after the Somerset MP\u0026rsquos remarks, filmed during a town hall meeting, were disseminated.  The issue of how to keep frictionless trade across the Irish border has become arguably the biggest stumbling block to getting a deal with Brussels on Brexit.  But Mr Rees-Mogg, who leads the pro-hard Brexit European Research Group faction of Conservative MPs, told the town hall meeting that Ireland \"would not be a free-for-all\" and that \"historic arrangements\" could continue.  He explained: \"There would be our ability, as we had during the Troubles, to have people inspected. It\u0027s not a border that everyone has to go through every day. But, of course, for security reasons during the Troubles, we kept a very close eye on the border to try and stop gun-running and things like that.

Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, also hit out at Mr Rees-Mogg, declaring: \"This man knows nothing of Northern Ireland.\"  His Labour colleague David Lammy insisted peace on the island of Ireland could not be allowed to be torn apart by \"hard right ideologues\"."},{"url":null,"title":"mark-smith-the-uncomfortable-truths-weve-learned-from-the-alex-salmond-claims","story":"  As for what the former First Minister actually said at the press conference, we should all be feeling some sympathy for him, as well as a large dose of frustration at what look like inconsistencies. In his official statement, Mr Salmond said he had not been allowed to properly challenge the case against him \u0026ndash \u0026ldquoI have not been allowed to see the evidence, he said. And yet in the same statement he said the complaints were patently ridiculous. So, which is it? How can he say the complaints are ridiculous if he has not seen them? He either knows what the complaints are, or he doesn\u0026rsquot.  Assuming he doesn\u0026rsquot, Mr Salmond is right to object to how the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos complaints process is working. It is one of the basic principles of natural justice that an accused person should know the details of the case against him or her, and who is making it, and yet it would appear Mr Salmond has been given neither of those things.  Increasingly, and sadly, this is how modern complaints procedures work, including it would seem the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos. But we should roll back on it before it\u0026rsquos too late. Anyone accused of anything should know the facts, the people involved, and they should be given a proper chance to defend themselves. Alex Salmond may be a hard man to feel sorry for \u0026ndash and his alpha-male personality around colleagues, journalists, and others may make him hard to like at times \u0026ndash but as an apparent victim of a flawed process, he deserves some sympathy.  There are other uncomfortable truths we\u0026rsquove learned from this affair, the first being how far some of Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos followers are prepared to go in demonstrating their loyalty. In the immediate aftermath of the press conference, some rushed to social media to suggest Mr Salmond was the victim of a Unionist/MI5/UK Government plot others suggested, wearyingly, that the BBC was using the furore to undermine Nicola Sturgeon. There was also some naked racism in the suggestion that all of it was happening because the civil servant in charge of the process, Leslie Evans, is a non-Scot and therefore non-us. The comments read like despatches from the Planet Loopy-de-Loo in the constellation of Ridiculous.  More worryingly, there were others \u0026ndash including women it must be said \u0026ndash who turned on Mr Salmond\u0026rsquos accusers, calling them liars or suggesting even that they might have \u0026ldquothrown themselves at the former First Minister. There were also questions asked about why it had taken \u0026ldquoso long  for the complaints to be made, the implication being that complaints that are not made immediately might be fake. But didn\u0026rsquot we deal with all that kind of rubbish as part of the Me Too movement? Isn\u0026rsquot it sad that it\u0026rsquos all being spread again by supporters of independence in the name of defending their departed leader?  There are other interesting lessons to be drawn from all this about the SNP and the relationship between Mr Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon. On the party generally, it\u0026rsquos clear it now has only two strategies on public relations and any crisis: total control and total silence. The party has been known in recent years for its cast-iron unity  and, remarkably, it has held. But as the Salmond claims emerged, the machine went into lock-down and the press department refused to answer any calls or emails from journalists. That is a dereliction of a party\u0026rsquos responsibilities, especially in the face of what could reasonably be called a national crisis: a former First Minister suing the government of the current one.  Then there\u0026rsquos the relationship between those two people, Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon. Both Mr Salmond and Leslie Evans were at pains to suggest the First Minister was not part of the process, but we know that\u0026rsquos a legal fiction at best \u0026ndash and it is one that will get harder to maintain, as the tortuous procedural reasons for not suspending Mr Salmond demonstrate.  As Ms Sturgeon herself suggested in her short statement, she and Mr Salmond have also been friends and confederates for years, even if the relationship has been under considerable strain for some time \u0026ndash firstly because of Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos show for the Russian broadcaster RT and now because of his decision to take legal action against the Scottish Government. The accusations against her old mentor have also obviously put the First Minister in an awkward position \u0026ndash don\u0026rsquot forget all those times she defended Mr Salmond against accusations of sexism: the notorious Fringe joke for example, or the time he told the MP Anna Soubry to \u0026ldquobehave yourself, woman.  Ms Sturgeon will also be aware of the damage the accusations against her predecessor could do to an already divided party and movement. It was bad enough that Mr Salmond has been shooting his mouth off about a second referendum, but the new crisis makes the problem even worse. As we know, Ms Sturgeon has been aware of the claims against Mr Salmond for several months so no doubt she would have been factoring them in to her strategising, but even so the rapidly diminishing prospect of a second vote on independence has diminished even further. A quotation from a comedy sketch set in a pet shop and starring John Cleese may even be appropriate.  But what if I\u0026rsquom wrong and it does happen? What if there is a second referendum on Scottish independence? Well, this latest crisis, however it pans out, means that Alex Salmond \u0026ndash the leader of the Yes movement of 2014, the man who took Scotland so close to independence, and still the pre-eminent hero of the faithful \u0026ndash would not be able to campaign in it. Now, that would be something, wouldn\u0026rsquot it?"},{"url":null,"title":"tory-arrogance-on-brexit-likely-to-push-more-scots-to-back-independence-claims-snp","story":"  Peter Grant, the Nationalists\u0026rsquo Europe spokesman at Westminster, warned there is \"not a rope in existence that is strong enough\" to hold Scotland to the rest of the UK if the Conservative Government pursued a \"cliff-edge\" Brexit.  SNP colleague Stephen Gethins added that \u0026ldquothe arrogant behaviour of the Tory Government\" is likely to make a growing number of people in Scotland \"see the benefits and attractions of independence\".  They spoke out after former European Council President Mr Van Rompuy argued that leaving the EU without an agreement would pose an \u0026ldquoexistential threat to the UK.  But the Scottish Conservatives have urged Mr Van Rompuy to \u0026ldquostop trying to interfere in UK domestic politics, while the Scottish Liberal Democrats warned against compounding \u0026ldquothe chaos of Brexit with the chaos of independence.  In his controversial intervention, the ex-chief Eurocrat said: \u0026ldquoThe no-deal issue is not just a problem for the UK or Brussels, it is also an existential threat to the UK itself.  \u0026ldquoOne can imagine that a no-deal will have a big impact and cause concern in some of the regions. Speaking of Scotland, it could have consequences for them and others.  Mr Van Rompuy also told The Observer: \u0026ldquoWe could end up with a situation in which the EU27 becomes more united and a United Kingdom less united. This talk about a \u0026lsquono-deal\u0026rsquo is the kind of Nationalist rhetoric that belongs to another era.  His remarks echo recent ones from some senior SNP figures, who have equated a hard or no-deal Brexit with a renewed push for Scottish independence.  Responding to the former Brussels chief\u0027s intervention, Fife MP Mr Gethins said: \u0026ldquoThe Tory Government thinks it can do whatever it wants to Scotland with its shambolic, disastrous hard Brexit plans and get away with it.  \u0026ldquoScotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU and, since the referendum over two years ago, Scotland\u0026rsquos voice and votes have been ignored. At the same time, the Tory Government in Westminster is using Brexit as a means of ploughing ahead with its power-grab from the devolved administrations.  But Paul Masterton, of the Scottish Conservatives, dismissed Mr Van Rompuy\u0026rsquos remarks as \u0026ldquoutter nonsense.  The East Renfrewshire MP said: \u0026ldquoNo matter what the outcome of the Brexit negotiations, nothing will be helped by Scotland leaving the UK.  \u0026ldquoScots know that you don\u0026rsquot solve leaving one Union by leaving another one that is far more important to us economically.  \u0026ldquoRather than weigh in unnecessarily, Herman Van Rompuy should stop trying to interfere and let us get on with delivering a Brexit deal that will work for the whole of the UK.  Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, suggested nothing good could come of a no-deal Brexit.  Insisting a People\u0026rsquos Vote on the final deal was the \u0026ldquoonly logical way forward, he added: \u0026ldquoWe should not compound the chaos of Brexit with the chaos of independence. Surely the lesson of Brexit is that breaking up is a bad idea?  Last week, following the publication of the first tranche of papers setting out Theresa May\u0026rsquos no-deal contingency plans, Nicola Sturgeon claimed that quitting the EU without an agreement would be an \u0026ldquounmitigated disaster while her Scottish Cabinet colleague Michael Russell branded such a scenario a \u0026ldquonightmare.  In contrast, David Lidington, the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos effective deputy, argued that a no-deal Brexit would in no way jeopardise the Union, saying the \u0026ldquostrength of the United Kingdom would continue regardless.  Earlier this month, the First Minister signalled that she was unlikely to be able to make a definitive decision on calling for a second independence referendum this autumn because of the uncertainties surrounding Brexit.  However, both Brussels and London have indicated that people will know by early November whether or not a deal is doable. Ms Sturgeon could make her key announcement within days of this development although Mrs May has made clear repeatedly she would not facilitate a second independence poll.  Meanwhile, Downing Street, commenting on Mr Van Rompuy\u0026rsquos remarks, said: \u0026ldquoWe have always said the United Kingdom would continue to thrive in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

It will begin the most intensive period on Brexit as the final deadline on any deal begins to near with Westminster returning from its summer recess on September 4, the special Brexit Cabinet due on September 13, the party conference season starting the same week, an informal EU summit in Salzburg on September 20, where the PM hopes to raise Brexit over dinner, and the European Council\u0026rsquos crunch meeting on Brexit on October 18/19.  After the Chancellor warned of a significant fiscal impact on the back of a no-deal \u0026ndash higher borrowing of \u0026pound80 billion a year - his former Cabinet colleague, David Davis lashed out at \"bogus\" Treasury forecasts.  The former Brexit Secretary and a leading Brexiteer accused Mr Hammond of being \"either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate\", adding: \"I know what I think.\"  He accused the Treasury of having \u0026ldquotrouble forecasting deficits even 12 months ahead\" and said Mr Hammond\u0026rsquos comments were an \u0026ldquoattempt to frighten the population into imagining the most terrible consequences of leaving the European Union without a deal.  Mr Davis went on: \"And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government\u0027s hand in striking a deal with the EU. If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.\"  Meanwhile, Mr Raab, in an interview with the Sunday Times, noted how the latest GDP estimates for 2019 had been \u0026ldquorevised up\".  Without naming Mr Hammond, he echoed Mr Davis, saying: \"I\u0027m always chary of any forecast because most of them have been proved to be wrong.\" He suggested such fiscal projections had to be treated with a \u0026ldquomeasure of caution.  Elsewhere, Nigel Farage pledged to return to the stump to \u0026ldquorestart the Brexit campaign as Leave Means Leave announced a bid to create a \u0026pound5 million war-chest over the next three months.  The former Ukip leader, who is Vice-chairman of the campaign, declared: \u0026ldquoI am going back on the road with Leave Means Leave to restart the referendum campaign.  Noting how the first campaign event would be in Bolton on September 22, he said: \u0026ldquoThis issue is above party politics and has never been a debate about left or right. Our task is to mobilise the millions of alienated and angry voters and to get them to put real pressure on their MPs not to betray Brexit in the coming months. They need to know that if they do, they will lose their job."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-insists-no-legal-basis-to-suspend-alex-salmond-from-snp","story":"  The declaration by the First Minister came as political opponents called for \u0026ldquofull transparency about any meetings that occurred between the two senior Nationalists regarding the claims against the former party leader, who has forcefully denied them.  In a statement, Ms Sturgeon explained that the party had not received any complaints about her predecessor\u0027s conduct nor had it carried out the formal investigation. But, she stressed, the matter would be reconsidered if the situation were to change.  \"The party\u0027s rules apply to all members and no-one is above them,\" declared the FM.  She noted that, as with any other organisation, due process must be followed. Yet she pointed out: \u0026ldquoIn this case, unlike in some previous cases, the investigation into complaints about Alex Salmond has not been conducted by the SNP and no complaints have been received by the party.  \"Also, for legal reasons, the limited information I have about the Scottish Government investigation cannot at this stage be shared with the party. And, rightly, it is the party, not me as leader, that has the power to suspend membership.  \"In summary, the party has no legal basis at this time to suspend Alex Salmond\u0027s membership, added Ms Sturgeon.  The allegations about Mr Salmond\u0027s conduct towards two staff members in 2013 - while he was in office - have now been handed to Police Scotland.  Leslie Evans, Permanent Secretary at the Scottish Government, said the complaints were raised in January and the former SNP leader was notified in March about an investigation.  She had intended to make a statement but the move was halted after Mr Salmond initiated legal proceedings.  Meanwhile, Scottish Labour said it was \u0026ldquounderstood the FM and her predecessor had met on \u0026ldquomultiple occasions to discuss the case.  It called for publication of the times, dates and minutes of any such meetings as well as clarification about whether Mr Salmond had asked Ms Sturgeon to interfere in the investigation.  Rhoda Grant, Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos Women\u0026rsquos spokeswoman, declared: \u0026ldquoThe people of Scotland expect full transparency in this case. She stressed that it would be completely unacceptable if the details of any Sturgeon/Salmond meetings remained secret.  \u0026ldquoThe allegations against Alex Salmond are incredibly serious. His meetings with the head of a government that was investigating him must not be kept under wraps. Nicola Sturgeon must publish the details and minutes of these meetings as soon as possible.  \"The SNP must also do all it can to give complainants the support they need, whoever the alleged perpetrator is, and make clear that there is safe space for any other survivors to come forward.  Ms Grant added: \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon should finally suspend Alex Salmond from the SNP immediately.  Annie Wells, the Scottish Conservative Equalities spokeswoman, said, despite Ms Sturgeon\u0026rsquos latest statement, many questions remained unanswered.  \u0026ldquoWe are still none the wiser as to the way the assault was treated when it was alleged to have taken place, nor do we know when anyone in the SNP or the Scottish Government was informed about the incident.  She added: \u0026ldquoAs the First Minister herself states, these are very serious allegations as such, they deserve to be taken seriously and that means seeing full transparency from the SNP and the Scottish Government as to how they handled it.  Jo Swinson for the Liberal Democrats stressed how people on all sides of the political divide needed to \u0026ldquoresist the temptation to make party political capital from a situation involving allegations of sexual harassment.  She explained: \u0026ldquoSupporters of Scottish independence should abandon Unionist conspiracy theories and supporters of the UK should be wary of immediately branding the SNP leadership of complicity.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos important now is that the police investigation is able to proceed unimpinged by political pressure and it should proceed irrespective of the outcome of the Court of Session case.  \u0026ldquoAny flaws in the internal government process do not trump the imperative of a thorough investigation of the allegations by the police.  The Lib Dem deputy leader added: \u0026ldquoWe should be wary of inflammatory words and partisan statements which distract from the matter at hand and could discourage women and men, who have experienced similar situations, from coming forward."},{"url":null,"title":"professor-dame-sue-black-forensic-expert-haunted-by-unsolved-cases","story":"  Professor Dame Sue Black has helped identify victims and perpetrators of crime in war zones like Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Iraq, and helped crack numerous criminal cases across the UK.  But asked if some cases still haunt her and wake her in the small hours, she recalled instances where families remain unable to lay their loved ones to rest.  She told how one young man found dead in woodland in East Dunbartonshire in 2011 is known to her only as \u0026ldquothe man from Balmore as he remains unidentified to this day.  She also cited her involvement in efforts to locate the remains of Renee MacRae and her son Andrew from Inverness, who disappeared in November 1976, and 11-year-old Moira Anderson who vanished in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, in 1957 none of whom have yet been found.  Prof Dame Sue said: \u0026ldquoUsually they arise with people who have bodies but you can\u0026rsquot figure out who they are.  \u0026ldquoI talk about \u0026lsquothe man from Balmore\u0026rsquo because I don\u0026rsquot know what his name was he was just the man from Balmore. He\u0026rsquos a young man and we found his body hanging in the woodlands, very badly decomposed.  \u0026ldquoSomewhere surely that young man has got family who are missing him, and so I hate those situations where you have a body but you are not able to let them go home because you can\u0026rsquot find their name.  \u0026ldquoBy the same token, those incomplete circles where you know somebody is missing but you can\u0026rsquot find the body.  \u0026ldquoWe spent a lot of time trying to find Renee MacRae and her three year old son Andrew who went missing in Inverness in 1976.  \u0026ldquoWe spent a lot of time trying to find their remains, and Moira Anderson who went missing in Coatbridge in the 1950s.  \u0026ldquoNot finding these bodies whilst there is still family alive is really challenging, because they talk about when that person went missing that their life went in to stutter. And although their life goes on it\u0026rsquos always anchored back to that point when that person went missing.  Dame Sue was Professor of Anatomy and Forensic Anthropology at Dundee University for 15 years, and head of the university\u0026rsquos Centre for Anatomy and Human Identification . She left Dundee to become Pro Vice-Chancellor for Engagement at Lancaster University earlier this month.  Speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, she added: \u0026ldquoI had a lovely letter from Renee MacRae\u0026rsquos sister saying that every time somebody digs to find where Renee might be she gets her hopes up again and then when we don\u0026rsquot find her she feels the same depression.  \u0026ldquoSo we don\u0026rsquot ever lose sight of the fact in our profession that there are living, breathing family waiting for that knock on the door that brings the bad news home but it\u0026rsquos a kind news as well as a bad news - it\u0026rsquos that certainty of knowing what\u0026rsquos happened.  \u0026ldquoAll Renee MacRae\u0026rsquos sister had said is \u0026lsquoall I want to do is to bring my sister home\u0026rsquo. \u0026lsquoI want to know where she is I want her in the ground I want to be able to visit her\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos the same for Moira Anderson\u0026rsquos family.

Shortly after the pope took off, Mr Varadkar tweeted that he welcomed Pope Francis\u0026rsquos call for firm and decisive action when it came to addressing clerical sexual abuse.

For his main course he had a choice of baked smoked salmon with braised Savoy cabbage, glazed carrots and baby boiled potatoes or basil pesto risotto with roasted summer vegetables.  A passion fruit mousse and Cocoa Atelier chocolate bites were served for dessert.

At present, Labour\u0026rsquos official policy is not to support a second referendum on the deal but there is a clear difference of opinion at the top of the party on the way forward were Theresa May\u0026rsquos final proposal to be rejected by MPs.  John McDonnell, the Shadow Chancellor, has said his preference would be to hold a general election while Sir Keir Starmer, the Shadow Brexit Secretary, has made clear all options should be on the table, including a second referendum.  Barry Gardiner, the Shadow Trade Secretary, however, has argued that another poll would fly in the face of the democratic vote undertaken in 2016 and could lead to civil disobedience.  Indeed, at the weekend, the Scot reiterated his fears, saying a People\u0026rsquos Vote would be a \u0026ldquodangerous thing. The London MP told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Westminster Hour: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove seen the referendum create huge divides \u0026mdash real, crunching divides \u0026mdash in our country. A second referendum will not heal those divides it can only exacerbate them.  The leaked memo, which was written by Tom Baldwin, a former adviser to Ed Miliband when he was Labour leader, makes clear that the People\u0027s Vote should not be regarded as a \"nascent\" centre party, which some supporters of Jeremy Corbyn fear.  Nor, it makes clear, should the push for a second referendum be seen as a bid to oust the Labour leader, stressing: \u0026ldquoWhatever views supporters have about the overall direction of the Labour Party, the campaign should not be used to attack Jeremy Corbyn personally.\"  On Saturday, the ruling body of the grassroots pro-Corbyn group Momentum will meet to decide on the way forward after more than 4,000 of its members signed a petition calling for a conference vote on the issue.  At the weekend, polling commissioned by the People\u0027s Vote suggested voters targeted by Labour were more likely to back a new referendum - and to favour remaining in the EU - than the electorate as a whole.  Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, told a People\u0026rsquos Vote rally in Newcastle on Saturday that Labour support for a referendum on the final Brexit deal would be crucial if one were to be realised.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf the Labour Party change their position and the Scots Nats and smaller parties go along with it, you will only have the Tories against. If some of them shift, that\u0026rsquos it.  His comments came after Tory backbencher Nick Boles, the former UK Housing Minister, told the FT that he expected at least 40 of his fellow Conservative MPs would vote to prevent a \u0026ldquono-deal exit from the EU.  The Lincolnshire MP said: \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot care how many of my colleagues dream of this in the midnight hour. There are not the parliamentary numbers to support a no-deal Brexit. And I will vote, as a Conservative MP in whatever way is necessary, on whatever motion will achieve the result of stopping a no-deal Brexit.  Meanwhile, the SNP leadership appears split on the merits of a second referendum on the final Brexit deal. Ian Blackford, the party\u0026rsquos Westminster leader, has said that while the Nationalists would not stand in the way of another EU poll, he fears that it could have a negative impact on the SNP\u0026rsquos bid for a second independence vote. It is thought his reservations are shared by Nicola Sturgeon, the First Minister.  However, other senior figures are thought to believe that another poll could be the best way to keep Scotland and the UK in the EU and, thus, the single market and customs union. Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Brexit minister, has made clear he is \u0026ldquovery favourable to the question of a second Brexit vote.  His Nationalist colleague Pete Wishart, the Perth MP, recently tweeted: \u0026ldquoI am persuadable on a second/\u0026lsquopeople\u0026rsquos\u0026rsquo EU referendum vote but its advocates have to tell us what would happen if Scotland votes to remain [which it will] and the UK as a whole votes to leave [which it might].

The team of international investigators has undertaken hundreds of interviews and compiled numerous accounts of crimes, including gang rape, the torching of hundreds of villages, enslavement, and the killing of children some in front of their parents.  The UN investigation was set up in March last year, nearly six months before a string of deadly rebel attacks on security and police posts set off a crackdown that drove Rohingya to flee into neighbouring Bangladesh.  It is estimated that some 10,000 people have been killed and more than 700,000 people have fled their homes in the last 12 months.  Chris Law, the SNP\u0026rsquos International Development spokesman, said the UK must now use its role as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to support the report\u0027s calls for top military figures to be investigated for genocide in Rakhine and for crimes against humanity.  This would include supporting a referral to the International Criminal Court and the establishment of a special independent body by the UN to conduct an investigation in support of war crimes and genocide prosecutions.  \u0026ldquoThe UN report confirms our worst fears about the crisis in Rakhine State and the true extent of the horrors faced by the Rohingya at the hands of the Myanmar military, said Mr Law.  \"It is vital that the UK Government now uses its role as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to push for senior military figures to be investigated for genocide and crimes against humanity and to work with international partners to ensure further sanctions against Myanmar.  The Dundee West MP has visited Cox\u0026rsquos Bazar in Bangladesh, the world\u0026rsquos largest refugee camp, and has campaigned for the UK Government to end spending on training for the Myanmar military.  \"Earlier this year, I visited refugee camps for the Rohingya in Bangladesh and heard first-hand the stories of the Myanmar military\u0027s indiscriminate killings and barbaric treatment of the Rohingya.  \"With the weight of evidence now available it is crucial that the international community presses for a full investigation of war crimes and genocidal acts and ensures those responsible are referred to the International Criminal Court.  \"We cannot allow these appalling acts to go unpunished and we must act to prevent these crimes from continuing,\" added Mr Law.

But specialists monitoring online conspiracy theories about Alex Salmond - and the allegations against him - have spotted a new online weapon: the McBot.  Scottish online activists appear to have set up automated or semi-automated accounts to retweet a hashtag #dissolvetheunion.  Ben Nimmo, an analyst for Nato-linked think tank the Atlantic Council, found 10,000 tweets using the hashtag from just over 2000 accounts in just a week. This level of hashtag use, he said, was double what you would expect in spontaneous traffic.

Some were bots, some looked like human users.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026lsquos no reason to suppose they were Russian: this looked like a local attempt to hijack the trends.  Accounts using the #dissolvetheunion last week were prominent in spreading clams or innuendo about the investigation in to the former first minister and current host on a Putin TV channel.

Investigators working for the UN\u0027s top human rights body took the unusual step of identifying by name six military leaders behind what they called deadly, systematic crimes against the ethnic minority, and who should now face prosecution.  They also sharply criticised Myanmar\u0027s de facto leader, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, for failing to use her \u0026ldquomoral authority to intervene to stop the attacks.  Mr Hunt took to social media to respond to the UN report, tweeting: \"Deeply disturbing to read UN report on crimes against Rohingya people.  \"There must be never be a hiding place for those who commit these kind of atrocities. Have decided to visit Burma to seek answers at the earliest opportunity.\"  The three-member \"fact-finding mission\" and their team, working under a mandate from the UN-backed Human Rights Council, meticulously assembled hundreds of accounts from expatriate Rohingya, as well as satellite footage and other information to assemble the report.  They detailed crimes, including gang rape, the torching of hundreds of villages, enslavement, and the killings of children some in front of their parents.  The UN investigation was set up in March last year, nearly six months before a string of deadly rebel attacks on security and police posts set off a crackdown that drove Rohingya to flee into neighbouring Bangladesh.  It is estimated that some 10,000 people have been killed and more than 700,000 people have fled their homes in the last 12 months.  Chris Law for the SNP called on the UK Government to impose more sanctions on the Myanmar Government at present it has an arms embargo and has also imposed a ban on the supply of equipment, which could be used for internal repression.  \u0026ldquoThe UN report confirms our worst fears about the crisis in Rakhine State and the true extent of the horrors faced by the Rohingya at the hands of the Myanmar military, declared Mr Law, the party\u0026rsquos International Development spokesman.  \"It is vital that the UK Government now uses its role as a permanent member of the UN Security Council to push for senior military figures to be investigated for genocide and crimes against humanity and to work with international partners to ensure further sanctions against Myanmar.  Earlier this year, the Dundee West MP visited Cox\u0026rsquos Bazaar in Bangladesh, the world\u0026rsquos largest refugee camp, and has campaigned for the UK Government to end spending on training for the Myanmar military.  \"With the weight of evidence now available it is crucial that the international community presses for a full investigation of war crimes and genocidal acts and ensures those responsible are referred to the International Criminal Court[ICC], he added.  His Nationalist colleague Carol Monaghan has written to Mr Hunt also calling for those responsible for the Rohingya massacre to be brought to justice.  Describing what happened in Rakhine State as \u0026ldquoone of the worst atrocities of the 21st Century, the Glasgow North West MP said the ICC was the only real hope for victims to see justice.  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government, as a penholder at the UN Security Council, has the power and influence to help bring perpetrators to justice through the ICC. They must use their position to echo and back these calls, she added."},{"url":null,"title":"housing development for inverurie site","story":"        A new  housing development may be about to get underway in Inverurie following a recommendation to grant planning approval for a new development by CALA Homes.

Colin Clark, MP for Gordon, said that retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the prolonged hot and dry weather this summer.

Mr Clark is a shareholder in a vegetable growing and packing company based near Inverness supplying carrots and potatoes to supermarkets.        Speaking during a visit to a farm in Moray, Mr Clark said: “This has been the worst drought since 1976 but it is a wake-up call for the supermarkets.“I have been involved in supplying fresh produce to the supermarkets for almost 30 years. Farmers and growers have become so professional that supermarkets and perhaps customers no longer understand how fragile the supply chain is.“Scotland will come into its own this year with availability of water and serious investment in irrigation.“Retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the hot dry weather. The east coast and the southern half of England have disastrous yields, crops have wilted and failed, the same is true across Europe.                                                                                                         “Supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed to keep prices down. “With less intense farming plant disease pressure is less, traditional rotations and precision farming give Scottish vegetable growers serious advantages.“Climate change predictions suggest the use of water will become critical and UK producers will have to be more efficient.”Mr Clark also sounded a note of warning about the ongoing row over UK-wide frameworks in areas like agriculture post-Brexit.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Monday 27 Aug 2018 9:44 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau , stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Monday 27 Aug 2018 9:44 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire.

Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Monday 27 Aug 2018 9:44 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people. These include social work, police, education, the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration and Children\u0026rsquos Hearings Scotland.No new panel member begins sitting on hearings without a thorough training being delivered beforehand. For any new Caithness trainees, the training takes place in Inverness.Panel member and trainer Christine Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt has been a great privilege to serve as a volunteer on the Children\u0026rsquos Panel for over 18 years and there are others residing within Caithness who have served for more than 20 years. Caithness Children\u0026rsquos Panel volunteers come from a wide iety of backgrounds and experiences \u0026ndash all walks of life make for a good blend.\u0026ldquoThe panel is always in need of new volunteers and, to that end, we are inviting any interested persons to our open evening, to take place at 7pm at the Children\u0026rsquos Panel Office, 23 Swanson Street, Thurso, on Tuesday, August 28. Please do consider coming along!\u0026ldquoThis is an information evening, where an overview of the voluntary work will be given, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session.\u0026ldquoThis is a great opportunity to find out more and to see if this is for you. Being a panel member is hugely rewarding \u0026ndash it is a great privilege to be able to come alongside families, young people and children in crisis and help them move forward constructively to a better future.\u0026ldquoIf you are interested in applying to become a panel member, please feel free to contact me for any further information. Also, you can check out the Children\u0026rsquos Panel website where you will find more information which should help you decide if volunteering for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel is really for you.Monday 27 Aug 2018 9:44 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August 27, 2018 at 1:16 pmFollowing a successful first visit to Orkney, university researchers who are working with farmers to understand their land and goose management preferences are returning to the county today, Monday.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders. If this hadn\u0026#8217t happened this week we would have been looking at next summer. I feel I\u0026#8217ve achieved something, I know this has been done before once or twice before, but this is something I will remember for the rest of my life. It\u0026#8217s very rewarding.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Local residents are digging in the last few metres of cable to more than 35 per cent of the properties.Community spokesman Steve Jones said: \"It\u0026rsquos a tremendously exciting time. Like many residents I\u0026rsquove only been getting very slow speeds capped at 0.5Mbps, making even the most basic of online activities difficult and frustrating, so looking forward to ultrafast speeds is fantastic.\"Fast, reliable broadband will bring huge potential to regenerate our scattered communities. It\u0026rsquos a prerequisite for attracting families and businesses to the area, where the population has fallen in recent years. People now expect good internet as a basic. In essence, it will help us to build a closer and more integrated community.\"Lesley Negri, who runs the historic Aultguish Inn near Garve with her husband Dario, added: \"It will make a huge difference to us, especially for our booking system and payments.\"At the moment everything slows down from 4pm and we can\u0026rsquot manage customer expectations. Many of our customers want to stream things or download photographs and it\u0026rsquos impossible to do that at the moment. We\u0026rsquove lived with slow broadband for so long that we can\u0026rsquot imagine what it\u0026rsquos going to be like when we can access ultrafast speeds!\"Monday 27 Aug 2018 9:45 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

She has it all.\"I would definitely say she is the best that I have ever had.\"She has strong flat bones in her legs, the hock is nice and high in her hind legs, her second thigh is nice and short, and she has a good deep body and good long silky hair covering her legs and the back of her hooves.\"And she\u0026rsquos good natured too, they generally are.\"The plant fitter, who works for Macdonald Groundworks, has been breeding his own Clydesdale horses for more than 30 years, following in the footsteps of his father and his grandfather, Donald Clarke, who worked on farms with the horses and took a stallion around the area.Mr Johnstone said: \"We also have Ord Tinkerbell\u0026rsquos full sister Ord Destiny and her mother Ord Envy.\"We keep them on a bit of rented ground. We just have them for showing and breeding.\"It\u0026rsquos a hobby, a very expensive one, but we try not to count it up.\"There\u0026rsquos quite a lot of work in it too, but it\u0026rsquos worth it,\" he added.Monday 27 Aug 2018 9:45 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

It consists of a retail box of fresh fish, sent directly to consumers all over the UK within hours of being landed. Fishbox now boasts in excess of 2000 subscribers with 100 new customers signing up every month.Mr Houston told the North Star: \"These are very exciting times for us. We will leave the Inverness premises on August 24. We have simply outgrown the premises and all of Coast \u0026amp Glen will relocate to Alness.\u0026nbsp We currently have 14 staff, plus four staff we have taken on from Summer Isles and are recruiting a further eight staff. There will me more next year too.\"Fishbox currently employs nine staff and this will increase next year too. We have big expansion plans for both companies.\"The award-winning businessman, a former motorcycle racer who taught himself the trade after a bad crash, has built up Coast \u0026amp Glen to a turnover exceeding \u0026pound2.2 million. The combined turnover for the two companies at the end of this year is set to top \u0026pound3m.His change in direction came by chance whilst out on a fishing boat. He went on to buy a small 21ft fishing boat, teaching himself from YouTube and Google. He decided to start selling his own catch and found the demand was so high he started selling from other boats. With the high demand from restaurants for a wider iety of products, Coast \u0026amp Glen was born.He said: \"I have always thought it\u0026rsquos very important to support the local community with jobs. It would be much easier for us to send fish to Glasgow to get processed just like majority of the salmon companies do and the whisky companies do for the bottling of their whisky, but that would have an impact on the area I was born and brought up in.\"This was the reason that I put a lot of time pressure on the people involved in the transition of the purchase of Summer Isles Foods.\"Monday 27 Aug 2018 9:45 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Fueltone, which provides fuel additives and engine treatments for domestic and commercial vehicles, has reported a year-on-year turnover increase from £570,000 to £684,000 for the year ended 31 July.            The company has grown its range during the period to provide products for both petrol and diesel cars and vans, as well as a specialist product for motorcycles, all of which are supported by the Scottish Motor Trade Association.            It has also introduced its offering to a wider audience by entering new markets, such as fleet and commercial vehicles, agricultural and plant vehicles, and equipment.Over the past year the firm has added 150 new stockists, bringing the total to some 450 locations in the UK. The company plans to develop an online selling function and is currently undertaking trials in international markets aimed at the heavy goods and general logistics markets.Charlene O’Conner, chief executive of Fueltone, said: “Our strategy to introduce a new product range into a busy and competitive market was a brave choice but by differentiating and leading with innovation and quality we have been a disruptive force amongst the market leaders in the UK. “It has taken time and investment but these actions are now bearing fruit.            “As brand awareness continues to grow we are bringing forward e-commerce functionality on our website but, uniquely, we will drive the fulfilment of that business into our distribution chain. “That way our loyal stockists will also benefit from our efforts to capture a higher proportion of online business.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4783471.1534192405!/image/image.jpg","title":"chris bambery how scotland s own occupy movement took over edinburgh 80 years ago","story":"        Frustration and anger at rising inequality is nothing new, as a largely forgotten chapter of Scotland\u0026#8217s history of protest shows, writes Chris Bambery                In June 1933, for three days and nights, jobless protesters occupied the centre of Edinburgh, sleeping out on Princes Street under the windows of the city elite’s gentlemen’s clubs.            An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

Consumed by the certainty of the zealot, former first minister Alex Salmond spent much of the 2014 independence referendum campaign loudly denouncing anyone who dared suggest that breaking up the United Kingdom might come at a cost to Scotland as a scaremonger.                The very idea that a Yes vote would be anything but the key to unlock the gate preventing access to a land of milk and honey was all part of Project Fear in fact, went the Salmond spiel, a No vote would be catastrophic. Only independence could save the country.            In the end, a majority of Scots refused to be “charmed” by Salmond, who became increasingly ratty as polling day approached and has spent much of the past four years refighting old battles with those – Treasury officials, the BBC, anyone who ever looked at him funny – he blames for his failure to lead Yes to victory.            The truth is that Salmond lost, fair and square. His campaign was full of enticing promises but bereft of detail. The former first minister failed to persuade Scots that leaping into the dark with him was worth the risk because he couldn’t provide plausible answers to the most basic questions on currency and the economy.The Salmond mantra – proudly repeated by his successor, Nicola Sturgeon, and other senior SNP figures – was that the best people to make decisions affecting Scotland were people living in Scotland. Only by unlocking this power, could the country truly thrive.Two years after Salmond failed to persuade Scots to take back control, Ukip’s Nigel Farage used an almost identical approach to help win victory for the Leave campaign in the EU referendum. At times, a note-for-note cover version of Salmond’s indy song, Farage’s argument – that the best people to make decisions affecting the UK were people living in the UK – was a success.So why do we continue to put up with the myth that supporters of Scottish independence and supporters of leaving the EU are fundamentally different?Scottish Brexit Minister Mike Russell last week warned that Scotland faced a “nightmare” if the UK government failed to strike a deal with the EU the damage to business, services and the economy would be disastrous.            And it’s entirely likely – since 62 per cent of Scots wished the UK to remain in the EU – that he will have enjoyed the support of many of those listening.In the absence of anything vaguely resembling opposition from the Labour Party, the SNP has filled the void where an anti-Brexit party should be.But that doesn’t make the nationalists’ case any more coherent.If it is reckless to break up a partnership with the EU, with all of the implications that move has for trade and the economy, why is it not reckless to break up a partnership with England, with which Scotland does most of its business?            And how on earth can anyone take seriously the SNP’s claim that only independence can “save” Scotland from the pain of Brexit?The former SNP MP, Jim Sillars, is that rarest of beasts – a pro-independence Eurosceptic. His position involves the unfashionable application of logic: if Scotland should be a “sovereign nation” then breaking all unions – not just the one with the English  – is necessary.Sillars’ position makes sense. It may not be appealing to those who believe in partnerships but it is intellectually coherent.This is much more than can be said for the position advanced by Sturgeon, Russell and others on the SNP front bench.As Brexit looms, the Scottish nationalists will ratchet up the message that a second independence referendum is necessary. They will insist that Scotland can escape the Brexit “nightmare” if only the people choose to break up the UK.            We should treat these claims with the utmost scepticism.How, exactly, would entering into another break-up ameliorate the damage caused by this one? Surely, the risk of a Yes vote any time soon is that a bad situation is made worse.Even Russell, not a man in possession of one of the finer minds in contemporary politics, must surely know that arguing what Scotland needs now is to be even further isolated is nonsense.Identity politics – so terribly popular right now – allows for people to hold entirely contradictory views at the same time. A Scottish nationalist, certain that theirs is the politics of hope, of unlocking potential, can quite happily believe that it is essential to have a formal union with countries on mainland Europe while it’s equally essential that links with England are broken. Surely the time to stop indulging this sort of nonsense has long passed?By all means, be pro-independence, but don’t try to kid yourself letting power reside in Brussels is somehow different to letting it reside in Westminster.The Leave campaign got away with quite a lot in 2016. They lied and bluffed and cheated their way to victory. In 2014, the Yes campaign – just as full of nonsensical claims, hyperbolic warnings and promises to take back power from the establishment – wasn’t so lucky.It’s been two years since the EU referendum and the SNP has been allowed – thanks to Brexit chaos in both the Conservative and Labour Parties – to proclaim its contradictory positions on independence with few questions asked. But this particular emperor has no clothes. A politician arguing that the uncertainty created by leaving the EU is bad but that the uncertainty created by leaving the UK would represent an opportunity is guilty of placing ideology above reason.The UK’s departure from the EU is to be hugely regretted. It will, I fear, be proved an act of national self-harm.Responding to the instability created by Brexit by arguing for the break-up of the UK – with all of the uncertainties such a decision would create – simply doesn’t make sense and we should stop pretending that it does."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4789888.1535357921!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment nicola sturgeon making right call on alex salmond","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        We have sympathy for those now calling for the SNP to suspend Alex Salmond over allegations that he sexually harassed two members of civil service staff while he was first minister.                Ideally – for the reassurance of those who have complained, if nothing else – his membership of the party would now be on hold while police examine information passed to them after a civil service investigation into allegations about his behaviour. But while this might be preferred, it is not necessarily a straightforward matter.            READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon: No legal basis to suspend Alex Salmond from SNP            Yesterday afternoon, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon addressed those calls for Mr Salmond’s suspension, making the point that – unlike in previous cases – the allegations against her predecessor have not been investigated by her party but by the civil service. This being so, no complaints have been received by the party. Ms Sturgeon added that what limited information the Scottish Government held about the investigation could not be shared with the SNP.Critics might dismiss this as buck-passing but it seems that the situation as described by the First Minister constitutes evidence that the systems put in place to handle cases of alleged inappropriate sexual behaviour are fit for purpose.Alleged victims who speak up about the behaviour of elected politicians must be reassured that civil service investigators will be free from any kind of political pressure. It is quite right that the SNP has been excluded from the investigation into Mr Salmond.READ MORE: Alex Salmond: The full statement from permanent secretary on harassment allegationsMs Sturgeon went on to say that, in recent days, there has been a considerable focus on process and that this should not be allowed to obscure the central facts of this case which are that two individuals have made complaints.            We could not agree more and there is, here, a test for all political parties. It may be tempting to try to score political points about who knew what and when or about the SNP’s failure to suspend Mr Salmond but more important than any of that is that those who have been sexually harassed or assaulted by an elected member feel that they can come forward and that their complaint will be treated confidentially, seriously, and with sensitivity.Mr Salmond responded to the First Minister’s remarks with his own statement in which he insisted it is now for the Court of Session to decide whether the process under which he was investigated was fair.Anybody who detects from that exchange a suggestion Nicola Sturgeon is not treating the complaints made appropriately and with the utmost seriousness is not paying close enough attention.READ MORE: Alex Salmond sexual harassment claims - What we know so far "},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4790073.1535352894!/image/image.jpg","title":"brian monteith theresa may has one last chance on brexit","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Theresa May will convene yet another special Cabinet meeting to discuss her Brexit strategy on 13 September. Phew, don\u0026#8217t you feel reassured?                If ever we required proof the Prime Minister has lost any command she might have once had of the Brexit negotiations this is it. Her ship of government is now rudderless, with both officers and crew disputing which course to take. Her Chief Brexit navigator, Dominic Raab, is constantly being undermined by her Chief Purser, Philip Hammond, while the restless crew is now openly mutinous.              The Chequers chart she is pressing upon everyone to follow, in the hope of reaching a safe haven, has been widely repudiated as certain to lead us to an interminable fate worthy of the Ancient Mariner. For in desperation to have a deal, any deal – no matter how bad or how distant from what she had promised – the Prime Minister intends to agree an EU treaty that will bind future governments in perpetuity, as if lashed to her mast.            The former Environment, Farming and Fishing Secretary, Owen Paterson, has just highlighted how Chequers means the UK remaining committed to the Common Fisheries Policy’s scandalous discard that puts 40 per cent of the British catch back into the seas as dead fish. That’s not Brexit, it’s what people voted to end.We are told that the special Cabinet meeting is necessary to ensure different departments are all pulling together as one on preparing for the growing possibility of there being no EU trade deal. Yet it appears more like a panic measure designed to frighten any doubters into believing her Chequers policy is their salvation from the intentionally heightened alarm surrounding no deal. Unfortunately the Prime Minister’s Chequers chart has been prepared by those who believe in a flat earth and that for us to journey the trade routes we must never lose sight of the EU’s shoreline or we shall drop off the edge of the horizon and into oblivion. Fortunately many of us know otherwise our world is round not flat, the Americas, north and south, Africa, Asia and Australasia all lie over the trading horizon. They are both hospitable and bountiful, with attractive wares and produce we would like, while in return they are attracted to the goods and services we offer.Only this week China agreed to allow UK seed potato exports, of which more than 70 per cent will come from Scottish farms. By opening up these markets and securing trade deals that remove such non-tariff barriers  the future of our prosperity lies. Yet Chequers would sink our ability to secure such deals with China, India, Australia, New Zealand and 40 other countries that are queuing up.The reality is dawning that such a special Cabinet meeting should have been convened immediately after the Prime Minister’s Lancaster House speech in January 2017. We should have been making preparations for the default position of “No Deal” right from the beginning so the expectations of the public were realistic and any difficulties that might appear could be identified in enough time to be catered for.            There would have been no dash for a deal at all costs that has inevitably put the Prime Minister at a weakness, now having to accept poor terms or look like an utter failure.The former Brexit Secretary David Davis continually pushed for making provision for No Deal a priority, he called for stating our policy on what the UK’s future relationship should be, but the records show the Prime Minister chose to ignore him.It is clear for all to see that the greatest fear the EU has is that the UK will make a success of leaving the EU. That our productivity and growth will accelerate, that our huge balance of payments deficit with the EU will shrink – and that we shall economically become to Europe what Singapore is to South East Asia and Hong Kong is to China.With our trading and regulatory outlook re-orientated away from one continent and towards the whole world – but especially the developing markets where the greatest growth is – we can grow faster than anticipated – yet again showing the Treasury’s predictions to be the false curse of doomsayers. The EU bosses fear any UK success will encourage other nations to set the same course too. There is no reason why Denmark and Sweden could not prosper outside the EU, nor the Netherlands, nor France, if \u2028it could rediscover the word entrepreneurialism.            For the EU it would be better we never leave port, but if we do it wishes we face such a storm we quickly lose heart and have to turn back – and there are many amongst us who would wish we -fail too.Yet with our soft power advantages of superior commercial law, being natural English speakers, having great strengths in science, education and culture, together with an extensive diplomatic reach, we have many advantages we play down too often.The Prime Minister has one last chance to put right all of her mistakes. Even now at this late stage she could announce she has tried her best to find compromise with the EU but at every turn Michel Barnier and Jean-Claude Junker have asked for more while giving nothing in return. She can say she cannot compromise any more, that she will no longer take the insults, the attempts to divide us against ourselves, the weaponising of the Irish border, Barnier’s meetings with opponents of the democratic expression of the British people – and that her Chequers chart will now be torn up.I have little doubt that the British people, including the majority of Scottish people too, would not deny she has tried – and been shabbily treated – and therefore warm to such a new approach. Sadly I hold out no hope that the Prime Minister will take such a new course. The special Cabinet meeting will, more likely than not, heighten the differences in the Cabinet and might even be used to justify yet more concessions, leading inevitably to yet more resignations.             If the Prime Minister sails on regardless of all the warnings that she is breaking her promises and humbling the nation with her embarrassing pleading to European leaders – rather than making proper preparations for no deal – a perfect storm will likely engulf the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham – and eventually take her down with it."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4790084.1535350699!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon no legal basis to suspend alex salmond from snp","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...        Alex Salmond will not be suspended by the SNP over sexual harassment accusations made against him because there is no \u0026#8220legal basis\u0026#8221 to do so, Nicola Sturgeon has said.                But the First Minister is now under pressure to disclose details of discussions she had with her predecessor about the investigation into his conduct amid claims they are being kept “under wraps”.            The SNP is now “recirculating” details of its complaints procedure to all members, and Ms Sturgeon yesterday offered a “personal assurance” that any fresh allegations will be treated seriously and in confidence.            Mr Salmond last night said that “every single person in Scotland” should be treated equally regardless of who they are.READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon: No legal basis to suspend Alex Salmond from SNPMs Sturgeon had been facing calls to suspend Mr Salmond’s membership of the party he led for more than a decade while he pursues a judicial review into the way his case was handled by the Scottish Government.Two Scottish Government staff members accused Mr Salmond of harassment while he was first minister in 2013. Mr Salmond denies the claims. READ MORE: Woman alleges Alex Salmond touched her breasts and bottom            It was reported over the weekend that one of complainers alleged Mr Salmond ordered her into his bed at his official Bute House residence and touched her breasts. The two women making the claims allege multiple incidences of harassment and conduct of a sexual nature during Mr Salmond’s time in office.However, the SNP leader said the party has a responsibility to act in accordance with “due process”.Ms Sturgeon said: “In this case, unlike in some previous cases, the investigation into complaints about Alex Salmond has not been conducted by the SNP and no complaints have been received by the party.            “Also, for legal reasons, the limited information I have about the Scottish Government investigation cannot at this stage be shared with the party – and rightly it is the party, not me as leader, that has the power to suspend membership.“In summary, the party has no legal basis at this time to suspend Alex Salmond’s membership. Of course, should that situation change, the matter will be reconsidered, as it would be for any member. The party’s rules apply to all members and no-one is above them.”Former children’s minister Mark McDonald was suspended by the party over harassment claims last year, which he denied. The difference appears that the SNP had conducted that inquiry, while this investigation was done by the Scottish Government. A report by the standards watchdog later concluded that Mr McDonald was guilty of harassment.Ms Sturgeon also revealed that the SNP is to “recirculate” details of the independent arrangements which are in place to consider complaints to all party members.            “I give my personal assurance that any complaints, about any member of the SNP, will be considered confidentially and with the utmost care and seriousness,” the First Minister added.The Scottish Government’s top civil servant, Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, has come under fire from Mr Salmond over the investigation process, which is now being challenged by the ex-first minister at the Court of Session. Ms Sturgeon said her government is “extremely restricted” in what it is able to say about “inaccuracies in the public statements of others”.She added: “That is frustrating but it is inescapable at this stage. In the fullness of time, the Scottish Government will seek to make available as much information as it can.“However, we should not allow a focus on process to obscure this central fact: complaints were made by two individuals that could not be ignored or swept under the carpet. “It is essential that organisations have processes in place to enable investigation of such complaints and, although I have no role in it, the procedure that has been used to investigate these complaints was agreed by me. “The Permanent Secretary was absolutely right to ensure that the procedure was applied in this case and she has my full support in having done so.“The Scottish Government will defend its position vigorously. However, just as importantly, it – and I – will defend the principle that complaints of harassment should always be treated seriously regardless of the identity, seniority or political allegiance of the person complained about.“Finally, I would ask that the privacy and rights of all concerned be respected and that any legal processes are allowed to take their course.”Ms Sturgeon’s comments came after her own former special adviser Noel Dolan, who worked closely with her for the best part of a decade, went on the offensive against Ms Evans.Mr Dolan said: “I have known Alex Salmond for over 35 years and I’ve never seen any inappropriate behaviour, nor have I heard any allegations of sexual harassment prior to Friday morning. “I expect Mr Salmond to be cleared of these allegations and when that happens I hope Leslie Evans, the Permanent Secretary, will consider her position.”Mr Salmond last night again insisted that the new process used to investigate ministers, introduced last December, is “fundamentally flawed”. He said he has been denied access to witnesses and effectively thwarted from presenting a defence of his own position.Mr Salmond said that confidentiality has not been maintained in his case but “subject to sustained leaking of the most unfair kind”.He added: “That helps no-one but harms everyone. It is therefore crucial to find out who in government was responsible.”He called for the Court of Session to be allowed “to do its job” in the judicial review he is pursuing.Mr Salmond revealed last week that he had spoken with Ms Sturgeon on three occasions about the case against him before it went public. He declined to reveal details of the conversations, but did admit all his discussions with senior figures about the case centred on how unfair the process was.Labour is now calling for the times and dates of these meetings to be revealed, along with any minutes from them. They are also seeking clarification as to whether Mr Salmond asked the First Minister to interfere in the investigation in anyway.“The people of Scotland expect full transparency in this case,” said Labour MSP Rhoda Grant. “It is understood that Alex Salmond met the First Minister on multiple occasions to discuss the investigation into allegations of sexual assault into him.“It would be completely unacceptable if the details of those meetings remained unknown.“The allegations against Alex Salmond are incredibly serious. His meetings with the head of a government that was investigating him must not be kept under wraps.“Nicola Sturgeon must ­publish the details and minutes of these meetings as soon as possible. “The SNP must also do all it can to give complainants the support they need, whoever the alleged perpetrator is, and make clear that there is safe space for any other survivors to come forward.”Ms Sturgeon had been unaware of the investigation into Mr Salmond until she was contacted by him in April.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said yesterday: “The First Minister was clear to Alex Salmond that she had no role in the process and would not intervene. For legal reasons we are unable to provide further detail at this time.“However, in the fullness of time the Scottish Government will seek to make available as much information as it can.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4790069.1535313779!/image/image.jpg","title":"scotch whisky association joins theresa may s delegation to africa","story":"        One of Scotland\u0026#8217s leading trade bodies is set to form part of the delegation accompanying Prime Minister Theresa May on her first official visit to Africa, it has been announced.                The Scotch Whisky Association has been chosen as one of 29 representatives to showcase the best of UK business for the visit to South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya later this month.            It comes after exports of Scotland’s national drink to the continent rose by 13 per cent over the past year, with the association reporting “a hundred bottles every minute” are shipped to South Africa alone. Karen Betts, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said: “I’m delighted to be able to join the Prime Minister on this trade delegation to Africa.             “It’s a great opportunity to showcase the heritage, craft and quality of Scotch Whisky in markets with significant potential for growth in the years ahead.“Exports of Scotch Whisky to Africa increased by over 13 per cent last year, with double-digit growth in both South Africa and Kenya. Yet Africa accounts for just 4.5 per cent of global Scotch Whisky exports, so there is plenty of scope for further expansion.”She added: “Importing to Africa can involve a good deal of bureaucracy as well as complex tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, which tend to stifle growth. I hope this visit will support the industry in helping remove some of these difficulties, and help Scotch to compete on a level playing field with local products.”The visit is designed to strengthen ties and promote trade links between Britain and Africa ahead of the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union and will mark the first time a British Prime Minister has visited the continent since 2013. In that time other world leaders, including the likes of French President Emmanuel Macron, have made repeated visits to Africa, while Japan now has more embassies in the continent than Britain.             Additionally, the UK has no embassy presence in 16 African nations, however two new diplomatic posts in Lesotho and eSwaniti – previously known as Swaziland – were announced by former foreign secretary Boris Johnson in April.A government spokeswoman said the Prime Minister will “set out how new partnerships between the UK and Africa can add value to the UK economy, create new market opportunities for British businesses and boost jobs and prosperity for the benefit of all” during the visit.In a statement, Mrs May said: “Scotland’s trade outside the EU is going from strength to strength, with an increase of over half a billion pounds in exports to these markets earlier this year.”“Scotch Whisky is known the world over for its quality and heritage and I want to see Scottish industry make the most of the opportunities that lie ahead in emerging markets across Africa. I am delighted that the Scotch Whisky Association will be joining me to further boost the reputation of Scottish trade overseas.”            The visit starts in Kenya on August 30."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006. Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen  and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

In other areas customers have been left facing road and ferry journeys of more than 50 miles to get to a bank.\nIn 1989, there were more than 17,800 bank branches estimated to be operating in the UK. By the end of this year that number is expected to fall to fewer than 8000.\nSome projections have suggested it could drop to as low as 600 branches in five years\u0027 time.\nBetween 2015 and 2018, 48 bank closures have taken place or are under way in the HIE area including 22 in the Highlands. Some of these are the last banks in their communities.\nConsultants Indigo House Group said banking facilities need to be understood as core to community infrastructure.\nIt said access to cash remained fundamental to the viability of the small retail businesses that are prominent in rural areas. This is especially true in relation to tourism businesses where the loss of access to cash via local banks could have a detrimental effect on long term prospects.\nAlthough there are potential alternatives, including online or Post Office banking and mobile bank vans, the report warned that these options raised concerns over such issues as cybersecurity, the fragile nature of Post Office contracts and accessibility of mobile banks for less able people. Customers facing a shift from a local branch to a mobile bank also consider this a backward step.\nIn its recommendations, the report calls for a collaborative approach involving Scottish Government, HIE, local councils, community members and delivery partners, including the banks and Post Office.\nIt also wants recognition of the importance of cash to local economies and support over time for a sustainable transition to digitally based economies. This includes the creation of digital inclusion strategies to help businesses benefit fully from online banking.\nThe report also recommended a Post Office banking strategy that would include securing the long-term sustainability of contract Post Offices to support rural economies and infrastructure.\n\nMonday 27 Aug 2018 9:46 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nMonday 27 Aug 2018 9:46 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117090.jpg","title":"Leader echoes call for special case funding","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHE Scottish Government is \"short-changing\" the Highlands, according to Scottish Liberal Democrats\u0027 leader Willie Rennie.\nHe has echoed local politicians and organisations who argue that Highland is a \"special case\" because of its vast geography.\nHe has told us that he agrees with council chiefs that the region merits a larger share of grant distributed by Holyrood.\n\"The special nature of services in this part of the country isn\u0027t recognised by the Scottish Government,\" Mr Rennie said. \"Highland is short-changed on the NHS and the way the Scottish Government tried to short-change it through council tax changes in 2016 was outrageous.\"\nA proposal was mooted, but later scrapped, for inflicting higher council tax band payers with an extra levy \u0026ndash \u0026pound5 million in Highland \u0026ndash to fund education attainment.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

It is only the second visit by a Pope to Ireland and has generated huge interest, particularly in recent weeks and days. \n\"Hundreds of thousands of people from right across the island are expected to travel to Dublin and Knock for the Papal events and countless more will be watching the events in the media. \n\n\"While for many this will be an occasion of celebration, for a significant group in our society it will also be a very difficult and challenging time. \n\"Many Irish people have suffered and have been deeply hurt by the abuses of the church over many decades, particularly the victims and survivors of child sex abuse and those who suffered in industrial schools, mother and baby homes and the Magdalene laundries. \n\"Many of them will have a very different view of this visit and I am very conscious of their views and acknowledge how difficult it will be for them,\" he said. \nConor Murphy said the Papal visit provides an opportunity for the Catholic church authorities to address the issue of abuse. \n\"For decades the Catholic church sought to cover up the horrendous abuse and this only compounded the hurt and suffering of victims and survivors. \n\"Hopefully this visit will provide an opportunity for that deep hurt to be acknowledged by the church hierarchy. But more than that, it is an opportunity to do something about it and that opportunity should be grasped. \n\"While the letter from Pope Francis acknowledged that hurt and suffering, it needs to be followed with more than words action is required,\" he said. \nThe former minister said the Catholic church needs to cooperate with investigations into abuse and address the legacy of abuse by providing redress to victims. \n\"This issue is not going away. While I acknowledge that the Pope will meet a number of victims and survivors of clerical abuse and it is important that he hears and listens to their stories, more is needed. The Vatican must release any and all files it holds that would help investigations and inquiries into abuse by priests and religious in Ireland and it must also commit itself to providing redress, including financial redress to victims of abuse north and south,\" he said. \n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27464  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\nThe first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades.\nToday, 24th August, marks the 50th anniversary of the first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon in County Tyrone. \nThe Brantry Republican Club, led by Annie Mary Gildernew, had campaigned against the lack of council housing in the area. \n spoke exclusively to Colm Gildernew, Sinn Féin MLA for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and grandson of Annie Mary or better known as ‘Nana’ Gildernew, about the first civil rights march and events leading to it.\n“Fifty years ago, on the 12th of October 1967, Dungannon District Council convened its monthly meeting.  \n“One of the decisions they were about to take would reverberate across decades and bring the northern Unionist state to its knees and, some argue, ultimately led to its demise as a one party Orange state.\n“The Brantry Sinn Fein Republican Club, under the leadership of Annie Mary Gildernew  had been trying to secure housing in the local area for nationalist families. \n“Dungannon Council refused point blank to build social housing in the Brantry area as this would also provide local nationalists with votes as well as housing.  \nInstead they agreed to build 15 houses in the then predominantly unionist village of Caledon and stated they would allocate these homes on the basis of half to unionists and half to nationalist families to ease the housing crisis.\n“At the council meeting this deal was reneged upon Unionist Councillor William Scott simply presented a list of 15 names which he had decided would be housed, no debate, no discussion, no democracy.\n“The Brantry Republican Club met immediately to assess their next move.  It was decided that they were left with no alternative but to take immediate and direct action.  \n“At 2am, on Friday the 13th of October members of the Gildernew, Goodfellow and McKenna families supported by the Brantry Republican club went to Caledon and took possession of two of the newly allocated homes,  including a three bedroom house which had been allocated to a single 19-year-old woman who worked for a Unionist election candidate.  \n“In May 1968, following a 6 month series of court action and coercion, the State’s patience gave way a force of policemen, led by the brother of the young single girl who had been allocated the house, evicted Nana Gildernew, her daughter Mary Theresa Goodfellow with a three-month old baby and two other small children, and her daughter in law Geraldine Gildernew, expecting me at the time and with two young children.  They were forcibly dragged from the house under the gaze of the world’s press. \n“This led to the organisation of the first Civil Rights March from Coalisland to Dungannon was 24th of August to protest the eviction. The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north. This could have a chilling impact on rights and representation in the six counties,\" he concluded.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8609692.1534933803!/image/image.jpg","title":"education authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the police.\n\nReacting to media reports about the future of school crossing patrols, a spokesman for the EA said: “The Education Authority does not intend to make any changes to the current arrangements for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n

                    \n            \n            \n\n“One of the other things that makes it a great day out is that simply we have many fewer separate events and far fewer participants than that of our Orange colleagues.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“So our preceptories have a much better choice of bands to employ, and to be quite honest they tend to go for the very best they can afford.”\n\nLimavady was “an excellent day” with some excellent bands and a good attendance of between 5-7500 people and 30 preceptories, he said.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nThe annual

He spoke of the need to show love to others and that it is not just enough to keep the rules, but to show love to our fellow men and that we ought not to discriminate. He illustrated his sermon by asking ‘who is my neighbour?’ a question which Christ answered with the parable of the good Samaritan.”\n\nThe Sovereign Grand Master Rev William Anderson was in Cookstown, where his address was well received and preacher Rev Dr David Murphy from Cullybackey spoke “extremely well” he said.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFormer Irish Labour Senator Máiría Cahill, now a Lisburn and Castlereagh SDLP councillor, accepted an invitation to attend the Cookstown parade - which was watched by 15,000 people - and the following dinner.\n\nShe said: “Upon taking up the seat in Lisburn and Castlereagh Borough Council I made a commitment to reach across traditional divides and work for all constituents no matter class or creed.” \n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nBandsmen  in the annual County Down Grand Black Chapter procession 2018 in Ards. \u0027Picture By: Arthur Allison, Pacemaker\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\nMr Scott said that a colleague who had been at the Ards demonstration “said he had a good day but smiled and said he had sore feet”. It was a “very long” demonstration with a route of about 4.5 miles with big crowds of about 25,000 people.  The speaker was former Free Presbyterian Moderator Rev Ron Johnston, Mr Scott said.\n\n“In Larne there were 10-12,000 people from all over Co Antrim and they had a speaker from Child Evangelism Fellowship, who are our designated charity. They were very well received.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe city of Belfast parade, which traditionally marches in provincial locations, went this year to Ballymena. It was well attended and an address was given by Chris Cunningham, Royal Black Belfast city grand registrar, who was part of an outreach team in east Africa last summer.\n\n“Donemana is probably one of the smallest demonstrations, which draws people from north and west Tyrone and even some from as far away as Co Donegal and Co Cavan.

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly

authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

They were beaten 2-1 last weekend by Wick Academy which brought an end to their 21 match winning streak.\nRemarkably, that run didn\u0027t yield Highland League success as Cove Rangers lifted their sixth league title.\nHowever, their season exploits were rewarded as they tasted silverware in the Highland League Cup and Aberdeenshire Cup.\nDue to the Bannsiders\u0027 participation in the competition, the Northern Ireland Football League have had to re-arrange the Danske Bank Premiership fixture against Ballymena United.\nThe original date was set for Friday September 7 but this has now been changed to Tuesday September 25 with a 7:45pm kick-off at The Showgrounds.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n         your_name.focus      return false     else if        your_email.focus      return false     else if        friends_name.focus      return false     else if        friends_email.focus      return false     else     ]]\n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \"\n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            .src = \u0027/securimage/securimage_show.php?\u0027 + Math.random return false\"\n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n       .ready .click .hide          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.          .attr + \u0027-menu\u0027.fadeIn          return false                .click .parents.fadeOut          return false                    */       ]]\n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n                           username.focus            return false           else if              password.focus            return false           else                      ]]\n      \n      \"\n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n               return false\" title=\"View The Leader online!\"\n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n banner\" title=\"Advertise with Us\" /\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n          ?

If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority  has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the police.\n\nReacting to media reports about the future of school crossing patrols, a spokesman for the EA said: “The Education Authority does not intend to make any changes to the current arrangements for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

this Stories In Sound documentary for BBC Radio Ulster, she follows ‘In The Footsteps’ of those first civil rights marchers. She revisits the issue of housing discrimination and the ground breaking protests of the young mothers of the Homeless Citizens League, and learns first-hand about the organisation of the march from the so-called “Protestor Number One”. She hears from Bernadette McAliskey about how the march turned her into a lifelong campaigner, as well as from those who took part in a counter protest.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nUsing a blend of highly personal interviews and archive audio, Lynette asks what spurred them to take to the streets in pursuit of civil rights, whether or not they achieved their aims – and at what cost. Fifty years on from that first civil rights march, how has Dungannon – and Northern Ireland – changed?\n\nIn the Footsteps - presented by Lynette Fay and produced by Freya McClements – is broadcast on BBC Radio Ulster on Sunday, August 19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8607316.1534771555!/image/image.jpg","title":"new barrel and bean is top notch coffee bar","story":"\nA new rustic-style coffee bar, Barrel and Bean, has opened in Dromore - creating 10 jobs, breathing new life into a vacant\u0026#160100-year-old building in Bridge Street and giving the town\u0026#8217s evening and night-time economy a much needed boost.\n\n                \nRecognising a gap in the market for enhancing the town’s hospitality provision not just during the day but also after 5pm, Barrel and Bean is a new venture by entrepreneur Jamie McCutcheon who also owns local business, HealthBod Fitness, which specialises in personal and group training.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAlready the fledgling business is showing early signs of being a great success, with customers from the town and further afield flocking to the top-notch venue to sample a delectable selection of sweet and savoury food accompanied by a wide range of premium quality beverages.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nKeen to show their support for the new business, Councillor Paul Greenfield accompanied by Councillor Mark Baxter and Alderman Paul Rankin, were among the first well-wishers to visit Barrel and Bean.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nOf course they could not leave without enjoying a refreshing cup of coffee and sampling some cake and tray bakes supplied by The Little Bakehouse, Dromore and Tasty Wee Numbers, Ballynahinch.\n\nEconomic Development and Regeneration Committee Chair, Councillor Paul Greenfield, commented: “Supporting the growth of a vibrant and thriving evening and night-time economy in all urban centres in the borough is a key council priority – so it’s great to see Dromore benefit from this new investment.\n\nWith its newly expanded visitor offering, Dromore has an equally important role to play in strengthening the evening and night-time economy, and like other towns in the borough should be viewed among prospective hospitality providers as an attractive destination for investment.\n\nBarrel and Bean is already delivering big gains for the town – creating employment, rejuvenating a disused building, encouraging locals and visitors to socialise in the town well into evening and acting as a catalyst for further investment. I wish Jamie and his team every success in the future.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nThe council has recently approved a new five-year Evening Economy Development strategy, supporting its growth and diversification, in particular within strategic areas of night-time activity.\n\nThe strategy incorporates retail, arts, culture and leisure and supports and promotes existing businesses in their evening operations, encourages the extension of day time activities and strives to attract new evening uses and events that add to the evening economy.\n\nAn individual action plan has also been produced for all six urban centres, reflecting each centre’s unique and diverse assets, and identifying priorities for promoting their continued growth.\n\nBarrel and Bean is open Tuesday and Wednesday , Thursday and Friday , Saturday  and Sunday .\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"excitement ahead of pope visit","story":"\n\nCATHOLIC\n churches around the city are bedecked with bunting and Papal flags as excitement builds ahead of the historic visit from the Holy Father Pope Francis to Ireland this weekend.\nThe momentous visit is being held to mark the World Meeting of Families , staged every three years for families to celebrate, pray and reflect together. This is the first time the event has been staged in Ireland.\nPope Francis will arrive in Dublin on Saturday, almost 40 years since Pope John Paul II came and addressed the faithful at capacity Masses in Drogheda, Knock and Phoenix Park. Pope Francis’ first engagement will be meeting President Michael D Higgins before visiting St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral and then the Capuchin Day Centre, which provides hot meals, clothing and showers for the city’s homeless. Pope Francis will then preside at the Festival of Families in Croke Park.\nHis visit will conclude on Sunday with a closing Mass at Phoenix Park. An estimated 500,000 people are expected to attend with thousands more watching the live footage from around the world.\nRector of Clonard Monastery Fr Noel Kehoe said that the parish is running a bus to the weekend events in Dublin “on Friday” and that he will be staying “to attend both the festival of Families and attend the Papal Mass”.\nParish Manager at St Oliver Plunkett Parish Glen Phillips told the Andersonstown News that Pope Francis’ visit had created “such a buzz within the parish”.\n“We have a coach leaving tomorrow  so that parishioners can attend the WMOF Congress in the RDS.\n“A number of families from the parish will also be attending the Festival of Families in Croke Park on Saturday and we are also running a coach to the Papal Mass in Phoenix Park on Sunday.\n “There is such a buzz around the parish as the Papal visit approaches. Many older parishioners remember Pope John Paul II’s visit and many young parishioners were brought up on stories about it. Pope Francis is re-invigorating the Church and many parishioners want to be part of that and show support for him,” he said.\nSt John’s Church was proudly displaying its bunting and Papal flags as parishioners filed out from Mass on Wednesday morning. Parish Manager Conor Neeson explained how some of the decorations had stood the test of time and dated back to John Paul II’s visit.\n“We will have a number of buses on from Friday morning taking parishioners down to Dublin for the Pope’s visit. As part of the Falls Road Pastoral Community, parishioners from Corpus Christi, St John’s, St Mary’s, St Paul’s and St Peter’s Cathedral will all be travelling this weekend. There is a great sense of occasion and I’ll be staying behind to organise the parish hall for the Mass on Sunday as we will be screening it live,” he said.\nChair of the Pastoral Council Annette Hinchcliffe said she will be attending the Mass along with her teenage children and had also been part of history when she travelled down on the train to see John Paul II say Mass in 1979.\n“Many of our elderly population in the parish would have loved to have attended the Mass on Sunday but a lot of the instructions about once people get off their buses is the walk to Phoenix Park which is a possible three miles. We thought it would be nice to bring everyone together to give them a flavour of the day so that they wouldn’t just be watching it in the house. Our parishioners will have an opportunity to come to the parish centre to watch the Mass and be with the other people in their parish,” she said.\nParishioner Frances McEvoy told us: “I’m going down today  for the different discussions and events that are taking place over the next couple of days each day ending with a Mass and I’m looking forward to enjoying the weekend celebrations as well.\n“I was in Phoenix Park whenever John Paul II came and I think this Pope has the same charisma. I think he will be very welcomed despite all that is going on at the minute.\n“It’s very exciting. I was in Rome before Christmas staying with friends and I was at one of his meetings, when he meets the people on a Wednesday. The atmosphere when he walks in is just incredible. There is definitely  something about him. I think despite in terms of some of the negative publicly there has been around the visit he will speak to the people and he speaks from his heart,” she said.\nAt an extremely busy The Holy Shop in city centre’s Chapel Lane sales assistants Maura McShane and Teresa Nolan told us how there had been “great interest” in their Pope Francis memorabilia ahead of the highly anticipated visit.\n“We have rosary beads, candles, framed photos of Pope Francis and prayer cards all to mark his visit for the World Meeting of Families,” explained Teresa. “He is a very popular Pope and the amount of our customers going this weekend to see him is unreal,” she said.\nMaura said that many people were calling in since staff created their window display and there was a real “excitement” with people ahead of the weekend.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"dup says no return to border posts as politicians reject reesmogg call for checkpoints","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Both sides have ruled out a hard border.\n\nIn the clip Mr Rees-Mogg says that the UK could continue with “historic arrangements” to avoid a loophole that would allow people to enter the country. He added: “There would be our ability, as we had during the Troubles, to have people inspected.\n\n“It’s not a border that everyone has to go through every day. But of course for security reasons during the Troubles, we kept a very close eye on the border to try and stop gun-running and things like that.”\n\nLast night, it emerged that the controversial remarks had been filmed at an EU debate at the University of Sussex in April 2016. However, that didn’t stop them going viral.\n\nWhile he didn’t openly criticise Mr Rees-Mogg, DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson disagreed with the need for Troubles-style border arrangements.\n\n“We’re very clear that what we want is a free trade agreement between the UK and the European Union, and of course that would mean the free movement of people, and it would also mean facilities for the movement of goods across the border without the need for new infrastructure to be put in place.\n\n“The UK has made clear that whatever the outcome of these negotiations, they do not intend to put checkpoints on the border. That is a position which we support.\n\n“The first element agreed between the EU and the UK was the continuation of the common travel area between the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic.\n\n“Therefore, even in a ‘no deal’ scenario, we believe that the common travel area would continue to operate, and we would not see the need for people to be stopped.”\n\nMr Coveney highlighted the clip on Twitter, saying: “It’s hard to believe that a senior politician is so ill-informed about Ireland and the politics of the #Brexit Irish border issue that he could make comments like these.\n\n“We have left ‘the Troubles’ behind us, through the sincere efforts of many, and we intend on keeping it that way.”\n\nSDLP Brexit spokeswoman Claire Hanna MLA said the comments were “pig ignorant and a disturbing warning about the aspirations of extreme Brexiteers”. \n\nMs Hanna said: “It is offensive that a senior politician would use the ‘Troubles’ as a benchmark for solving the border issue. This unguarded answer exposes how empty all the honeyed phrases about not returning to ‘the borders of the past’ over the last two years really are.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37255460.ece/5d240/AUTOCROP/w620h342/_K0295.jpg","title":"belfast security alert ends after suspicious device declared a hoax","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We are committed to ensuring staff receive their correct pay.\n\n\"We will work with BSO colleagues as a matter of urgency to address this concerning matter for all staff affected.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"families in need moving into modular homes a year earlier","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

can now be erected on pre-prepared foundations in a single day, ready for connection to gas, electricity and water supplies.\n\nClanmil Housing is working with the McAvoy Group builders to deliver new homes using an innovative off-site housing solution.\n\nForty on the site of the former Woodside’s foodstore in Carrickfergus in Co Antrim will be the first social homes in Northern Ireland delivered using off-site factory construction, Clanmil said.\n\nThey modules will be delivered to the site complete with kitchens, bathrooms, windows, flooring and decorated walls.\n\nThe £6.2 million housing scheme, a mix of family houses and apartments for active older people, is being built by Clanmil with the assistance of £3.1 million grant support from the Department for Communities.\n\nThe new homes, each made up of a number of steel-framed modules, will be manufactured and fully fitted-out by McAvoy in its Lisburn factory before being craned into position on site.\n\nThe construction method will reduce the build time for the Carrickfergus development by 56 weeks compared to traditional site-based building, delivering 40 new homes in just nine months.\n\nDavid Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation, said: “The UK’s housing shortfall is only going to be addressed by radical innovation in building practices, such as modular housing.\n\n\n\nThis method of construction has real potential to help address the current housing shortage\nDavid Orr\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n“This method of construction has real potential to help address the current housing shortage.\n\n“In the UK, the Government sees off-site manufacture as a huge opportunity and has promised to support housing providers to build more homes in this way.\n\n“It is really exciting to see a Northern Ireland housing association and a Northern Ireland manufacturer working together to harness innovation that can deliver homes in up to half the normal time.”\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37247553.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/pope_ireland_010.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest updates","story":"\n Hi

said: “2018 has been another fantastic year for the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.\n\n“Artists from around the world have flocked to Scotland’s capital, delighting audiences with work that is exciting, shocking, entertaining, world class and often, hilarious.\n\n“From cabaret to children’s shows, invigorating dance and physical theatre, to life enhancing drama, whatever the medium, so many Fringe artists help us to question the world around us and illuminate the most challenging areas of being human in new ways.\n\n“It is an exceptional festival where audiences can curate their own experience and where all ages and tastes are catered for.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nAcrobats from Cirque Berserk took part in the Edinburgh Festival Fringe \n\n\n\n\nThe Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the world’s largest arts festival, got under way at the start of August and has seen a total of 3,548 shows staged across 317 venues.\n\nVenues ranged from large theatres to a chicken coop with a capacity of three, organisers said.\n\nSir Tim O’Shea, chair of the Fringe Society, said: “Following on from the success of the Fringe’s 70th anniversary celebrations, the 2018 Fringe has been a feast for the senses and the soul.\n\n“Our thanks go to the thousands of participants that have brought their passion and enthusiasm to this year’s festival, dazzling and inspiring audiences from home and abroad with an astounding array of work.”\n\nThe figures emerged hours ahead of the curtain coming down on the city’s main festival season with the Edinburgh International Festival’s fireworks concert.\n\nNext year’s Edinburgh Festival Fringe will run from August 2 to 26.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures teams face off in annual football in the river

You’ve probably seen him in Sandinos, The Guildhall Taphouse, Rodden’s in Buncrana or the Grand Central.\n\nThe whole point of these articles is to highlight the importance of the local music scene and he and his brother Christy are widely regarded as innovators in the dance music fraternity, with tributes from Celtronic and other DJs piled up on Facebook since the terrible news seeped out last Saturday night.\n\nI’m a rocker myself and came quite late to the dance party, but God love him John did his best to educate me. \n\nHe had been for a number of years one of them Derry faces I was familiar with but had no name or conversation to put with it. \n\nOver the years of being his friend I was always amazed by the education he gave me, people I should at least give a chance to listen to and always revere Michael Jackson for he is the source of all that is good in music….at least it wasn’t The Beatles.\n\nWe eventually became friends over a shared love of music, films and a weird sense of humour. \n\nOur conversations always returned to music and would almost certainly contain the words Boards of Canada. \n\nAs a vinyl collector it was John who encouraged me to get into DJing myself so for all those who’ve endured my weird sets, it was his fault entirely.\n\nI spent many a night with him while he was on in Sandino’s and developed an appreciation for music.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nI would have otherwise never entertained, I attribute my love of Prince to his sets which goes to show a DJ has done their job right if they’ve turned at least one person on to something. \n\nJust as I’m writing this I wish I had referred to him as Jimmy Rabbitte from The Commitments at least once, he had been playing the Courteeners way before any of us had even heard of them and he was the first to realise they were s***.\n\nNot only did John entertain people with other people’s music but he made his own music, he never let me hear it though. \n\nI’m sure somebody out there has heard it and it won’t be lost. \n\nKnowing John the Greek as I did I’m sure it has his perfectionist stamp all over it.\n\nI could get carried away and paint him as a one-dimensional character and forget his many other loves, including the great outdoors and adventures. \n\nI have been privy to jumping in a car with John without actually asking for a plan and ending in Donegal for the day in absolute sobriety and perfect gratitude for the beautiful scenery and the many things we could do for free right on our own doorstep.\n\nI can’t miss the opportunity to point out two facts here, the first that John was actually a fairly decent barber, which leads to the second fact that once upon a time I used to have hair and he was my personal stylist – although he eventually admitted defeat and suggested accepting baldness and shaving it off!\n\nTributes have come in from all over, the bars and their staff he entertained in will miss him terribly, his ability to know what song to play isn’t that common, nor is the warmth and humour he exuded. His funeral was a testament to the love he showed the world with each of us leaving under no doubt that there is a time to moonwalk.\n\nI’ve waffled on enough and these memories are my own, but they are great memories and I will always look back with a smile. \n\nI’m glad I knew The Greek and I hope that your memories make you smile and hope our love is of comfort to Sophie, his parents and sisters Mia and Angela and their families.\n\n\n\nIf anyone reading this, musician or otherwise feels that they need help get in touch with Help Musicians here https:www.musicmindsmatter.org.uk/ or call 0207 239 9101 or contact Samaritans 028 7126 5511.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein slammed opportunistic civil rights commemoration set take place derry october","story":"\nA member of the civil rights movement who was involved in the historic march on October 5, 1968, has criticised Sinn Féin for organising a commemoration parade to mark its 50th anniversary later this year.\n\nAidan McKinney, who is a member of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Committee, said the parade organised for October 6, 2018, is ‘opportunistic’ on the part of Sinn Féin and ‘they should be ashamed of distorting a seminal moment in the history’ of Derry and Northern Ireland.\n\nOn the parades commission website the applicant listed is the ‘Sinn Fein Commemoration Committee’ and the proposed route for marchers will take in Duke Street, Craigavon Bridge, Carlisle Road, Ferryquay Street, the Diamond, Shipquay Street and finish at Guildhall Square.\n\nThe original planned route by the Derry Housing Action Committee  and Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association , was planned to end at The Diamond on October 5, 1968. \n\nHowever, the march ended at Duke Street due to a banning order signed by William Craig, Stormont\u0027s Minister for Home Affairs, where peaceful demonstrators were met with unwarranted police brutality, including four Westminster MPs.\n\nSpeaking to the Derry News, Mr McKinney said he is both ‘fearful’ and ‘highly sceptical’ as to why a ‘single political entity’ would select that date and route. \n\n“However, to be kind or naive, hopefully they feel that what was organised by the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association on those dates, a totally peaceful protest and a willingness to endure state violence, is recognised and commended as the proper and unselfish approach to correcting existing wrongs in Northern Ireland,” he said\n\n“When the combined words ‘Civil Rights’ are used it is generally accepted that all genuine supporters embrace the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \n\n“Its first articles include: The right to equality and freedom from discrimination The right to life, liberty and personal security.\n\n“These humanitarian rights were enshrined for all of us with an expectation that globally such would be implemented as part of our personal and collective social interactions. \n\n“If this is clearly understood and promoted, as part of these planned events, it is to be welcomed. If not, then they will fail to absorb and highlight, the true spirit of \u002768.”\n\nMr McKinney questioned why an application for the parade was put forward as early as March and whether Sinn Féin felt major civil rights\u0027 concerns, ‘not least a non-functioning government resulting in adverse social consequences, were irrelevant and had no great immediacy?’\n\nHe pointed to the significance of that date in Derry and the north’s history which is recognised by lowly-paid, unemployed, homeless and the disenfranchised as a ‘a turning point for radical political, social and economic reforms in Northern Ireland.’\n\n“October 5th 1968,” he explained, “is a date linked to an era of hope when pro-democracy citizens banded together to achieve equality for all sections of our population, following the examples of Gandhi and Dr. Martin L. King. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“If this historic analysis is distorted by sectarianism it will transpire that there are no limits on what this organisation would do to \u0027legitimize\u0027 themselves.\n\n“The NICRA was a non-party political cross-community organisation which gave the people of Northern Ireland an aspiration that radical change was possible. It created a vehicle whereby all were enabled to participate in a non-violent manner.\n\n“It seems blatantly partisan for one political group, rather than adopting a broad-front approach to contemporary issues, to proceed with a demonstration that suggests an opportunistic attempt to usurp the date and message of NICRA in 1968.\n\n“If that is the case, as many former campaigners and others from a wide range of backgrounds believe, then they should be ashamed of distorting a seminal moment in the history of this place to attract short-sighted populist gain via unpredictable media attention, alongside the inherent dangers, e.g. uncontrollable violent elements.”\n\nIn response Sinn Féin provided a statement from Tyrone MP Francie Molloy who said the party ‘were and remain’ at the forefront of civil rights and social justice campaigns. \n\nHe commented: “Fifty years ago, likeminded people from all communities, including republicans – outraged by the routine injustice and sectarianism of the six county state - came together to form the Civil Rights movement.\n\n“To mark the 50th anniversary of the civil rights march in Derry, Sinn Féin have organised a commemorative march from Duke Street to Guildhall Square, along the original planned route of the march. \n\n“Republicans were to the fore of and remain to the fore of civil rights and social justice campaigns. We would welcome anyone who feels the same to join us.”\n\nSurviving leaders and supporters of the original march were said to have met last November in Belfast City Hall where they decided on a programme of events.\n\nIt is noteworthy, Mr McKinney said, that \u002768 veterans at the initial meeting unanimously voted down a public commemorative demonstration ‘to avoid what may have been interpreted as a coat-trailing exercise’ thereby avoiding any possible violence on the streets. \n\n“It was agreed that such incidents would be highly injurious to the civil rights\u0027 cause, with resultant harmful images of our struggling city and general population, via regional and global media,” he said.\n\nA three-day programme of events will run at the Guildhall from October 4-7 to mark the international Civil Rights Festival, commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Duke Street Civil Rights March, which will see the Irish President Michael D Higgins make a keynote address.\n\nThe event was launched by 50th Anniversary Civil Rights Commemoration Committee last week, and will explore the civil rights\u0027 legacy through documentation, conferences, films and other educational activities.\n\n\nABOVE - Aidan McKinney, far right, pictured with some of the key figures of the Civil Rights Movement with then then President Mary McAleese during her visit to the Guildhall in Derry to mark the 40th anniversary in October 2008.

In April, Newry, Mourne and Down Council also backed the campaign to retain the sweeping beam at the lighthouse, vehemently rejecting the controversial proposal to remove it.\n\nSpeaking following Sunday\u0026rsquos community protest, Mr Hazzard said: \u0026ldquoFor 150 years the iconic sweeping beam from St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse h\u0026nbsp as been a fundamental part of life for those of us who live and work in East Down.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Commissioners of Irish Lights current proposals to alter this beam as a result of their planned refurbishments of the lighthouse are unacceptable and are therefore opposed by both heritage campaigners and the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe have unfortunately seen CIL\u0026rsquos modernisation policy diminish the unique character of Irish lighthouses in recent years.\n\n\u0026ldquoRecent problems at Tory Island, Mew Island and Fastnet are a timely reminder as to why we must not tamper with the special heritage at St John\u0026rsquos.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe message remains the same \u0026mdash leave our light alone.\n\nLocal Sinn F\u0026eacutein Cllr John Rice, who also attended the protest, added: \u0026ldquoSt John\u0026rsquos Point is one of the most iconic pieces of social heritage that we can offer.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe light itself can be seen right across the constituency and it is something that locals enjoy greatly from as far as the Mournes and Slieve Croob.\n\n\u0026ldquoI like most other people grew up always admiring this great light house and I feel that the Irish Lighthouse authority must stop their proposed changes immediately.\n\nEileen Peters, one of the local campaigners, said the protest was chosen to coincide with International Lighthouse weekend.\n\nShe said Captain McCabe from CIL made a \u0026ldquosurprise entrance with plans for the lighthouse \u0026ldquowhich unfortunately, are still at iance with those of the local community.\n\n\u0026ldquoHe presented the case for a replacement light, which he claims would provide the same beam as the original, said Ms Peters. \u0026ldquoThis cannot be the case as the range of the light would be reduced by several miles.\n\nMs Peters also argued CIL had not taken into account reports by eminent toxicologists on the safe use of mercury in lighthouses, or the findings of the Royal Society\u0026rsquos Publication on the detrimental effects of LED lighting on epifaunal marine communities.\n\nMs Peters said that following their extensive research and campaigning they were \u0026ldquodismayed at the ease in which the heritage of Irish is discarded.\n\n\u0026ldquoLecale Lightkeepers would like to thank the local community and all who made their way to the lighthouse on Saturday for their support, she said. \u0026ldquoWe are grateful to Chris Hazzard MP, Cllr Dermot Curran and Cllr John Rice for attending today\u0026rsquos event, and thank Cllrs Patrick Brown and Gareth Sharvin for their good wishes.\n\nAhead of Sunday\u0026rsquos protest CIL said it had confirmed its commitment to retain the sweeping beam with an LED light.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoAs part of the Commissioners of Irish Lights ongoing investment programme to maintain and modernise its aids to navigation, planned work at St. John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse will deliver environmental, safety and cost benefits and is part of the continuing investment programme of maintenance, upkeep and modernisation of our coastal services to the mariner.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe main programme of works at St John\u0026rsquos Lighthouse, due to take place in the coming years, is the replacement of the light source with a new LED light. This light source will be housed within the original Fresnel lens and there will be no changes to the visual structure of the light source. The new LED light will maintain its sweeping beam and will use less than 30 watts compared with the previous 1000 watt lamp thus improving its environmental footprint and removing the need for a diesel generator at the station. It will also allow the removal of mercury from the station.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights has addressed previously held concerns relating to the sweeping beam and has reiterated that the solution being considered for St John\u0026rsquos Point will ensure that the beam will retain its sweeping feature and rotating lens will be unaffected visually.\n\n\u0026ldquoSince this project was first proposed in 2016, Irish Lights has engaged with local stakeholders, including Lecale Lightkeepers, on the replacement of the lens, and has taken on board key concerns raised by these groups and will continue to engage with the community on an ongoing basis to ensure the unique lighthouse heritage is protected.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights is currently trialling a system that will allow the lens to rotate in the same manner it currently does and will engage with the local community once again when this trial project comes to a final conclusion. When the project is in a position to progress Irish Lights will continue to consult with the local community and will ensure all planning and heritage requirements are met.\n\n\u0026ldquoIrish Lights respects the right to protest however urges members of the public to be cognisant of tenants and tourists who are currently residing at St John\u0026rsquos Point Lighthouse.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Celtic tournament success  ","story":"\t\t\t\nTHE club\u0026rsquos fourth annual youth tournament took place in Dunleath Park at the weekend and it was another overwhelming success with 70 teams participating over the course of Friday evening and Saturday morning.\u0026nbsp\n\nCeltic Bhoys would like to thank all the clubs who participated in the tournament along with the players and spectators who attended on both days.\u0026nbsp\n\nFurthermore, they would like to thank all all those who worked behind the scenes with the club including Newry, Mourne and Down Council Officials Davy Duggan,Tony McShane, Rita, Lewis and all their support staff for the logistical support and the marking out off the 7-a-side pitches.\u0026nbsp\n\nSpecial thanks also goes to the local referees who officiated during the tournament and last, but certainly not least, all the club volunteers who once again outdid themselves to make it all possible.\n\nTraining has now recommenced for all the club\u0026rsquos youth teams.

Fortunately, on-one was injured.\n\nHowever, local people were puzzled that the nearby coastguard services did not promptly answer an emergency call and the incident led local councillor George Flinn to call for a review of rescue procedures.\n\nMr Flinn was given his answer this week in a frank letter from the coastguard service, which admitted there had been a 17-minute delay.\n\nHe was told in the letter, read to Down councillors, that the RNLI is currently reviewing the type of life craft and the methods used along the Down coastline and it will be taking into account the incident at Coney Island.\n\nThe letter pointed out that it was ironic that the coastguard had identified the Killough area as a likely accident spot on that day because of the water sports being held as part of the village\u0026rsquos festival weekend.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe failure of radio units meant they could not assist the young men in canoes at Coney Island. The unacceptable delay of 17 minutes has caused us concern, the letter stated.\n\nBut the letter ended by warning that people who disregard advice and put to sea in unstable craft in bad conditions usually preclude rescue attempts.\n\nNEWCASTLE \u0026mdash Bulldozers moved in at the weekend to begin work in Newcastle\u0026rsquos new street widening scheme \u0026mdash and one of the first landmarks of the seaside resort to get the chop was the street wall at Central Promenade.\n\nThe scheme, which should eliminate Newcastle\u0026rsquos chic-a-bloc summer traffic jams, will take more than a year to complete.\n\nIn the meantime diversions and changes in traffic flow are in operation, the main change being at Bryansford Road, which will now carry two-way traffic, and at the main access to Donard Park, which will now become an exit only, with entry beside Patton\u0026rsquos Bridge.\n\nCASTLEWELLAN \u0026mdash A Castlewellan councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, has offered a \u0026pound200 reward in an all-out bid to catch the thieves who stole several thousand pounds from her on Saturday.\n\nA shocked Mrs Smyth told the Recorder that over \u0026pound5,000 worth of assorted furniture was taken and that she may have little chance of recovering it.\n\nThe burglary, described by Mrs Syth, as a \u0026ldquowell organised and large scale operation, occurred in the early hours when she was asleep at her home in Ballywillwill.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy husband and I were awakened by a notice outside. My husband got up and saw people outside.

In this case it is believed that some of the weed has found its way into the river and has been washed up on the banks.\n\nThe death toll up to now includes a cow, a bullock and three sheep. In each case the poisoned animals had access to the river or one of its tributaries.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said the weed resembles the more common and harmless \u0026lsquoFools Parsley\u0026rsquo, but is regarded as the most poisonous plant growing in Northern Ireland.\n\n\u0026ldquoIf farmers find it on their land the safest thing they can do is to dig it up entirely and destroy it, the spokesman said. \u0026ldquoHowever, great care must be taken to do this properly.

If no agreement is reached with him the land might have to be vested, meaning a lengthy hold-up.\n\nWhen it does go ahead, the new car park will be built between Irish Street and Market Street and will hold up to 80 cars.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe hope to enter the construction stage in this financial year because money is available, the Roads Service spokesman said. \u0026ldquoWe are very anxious to press on in an effort to provide good parking facilities at that end of the town.\n\nLOUGHISLANDREAVY \u0026mdash A builders hut at Loughinislandreavy, outside Castlewellan, was broken into on Thursday night. The hut belongs to McCartan and McAteer builders and rolls of steel wire and a pair of wire cutters were stolen.\n\nDUNDRUM \u0026mdash Heavy rain may have kept the numbers down, but \u0026pound8,000 was still raised at a garden fete organised by the William Keown Appeal Fund at Dundrum Castle on Saturday.

But the scale and the delivery are all Todd\u0026rsquos own, and he delivers it perfectly.\u0026rsquo\n\nSee him in his natural environment, on stage at a comedy show, at Portico on Saturday, September 15.\n\nThe performance starts at 7.30pm and tickets are \u0026pound14.

The tower will be removed between November and April.\n\nFor many local people the dismantling work marks the end of an era. The world\u0026rsquos press watched when Seagen was towed into place in March 2008 and hopes were high that it would be a source of clean and cheap electricity.\n\nIt was the world\u0026rsquos first and largest tidal energy generator and was specifically designed for the fast-flowing waters of the Strangford Narrows.\n\nA spokesman for owners Simec Atlantis Energy said: \u0026ldquoEven during decommissioning SeaGen continues to provide invaluable information to help us understand the engineering and environmental requirements related to the complete life-cycle of a tidal stream development.\n\n\u0026ldquoSeaGen has played a pivotal role in the development of tidal energy technology, installed in 2008 SeaGen delivered 10 GWh of electricity to the Northern Ireland grid.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe engineering lessons learnt and operational experience gathered during installation and operation advanced the development of SeaGen tidal technology. The environmental data has furthered the understanding of the environmental impacts of tidal technology upon the marine environment.\n\nThe spokesman added: \u0026ldquoThe SeaGen Project has been a resounding success. Atlantis continues to utilise the data acquired in Strangford to explore development opportunities at tidal sites around the world.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]
