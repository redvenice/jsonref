[{"url":null,"title":"Are Englands coronavirus cases creeping up","story":"Share this article In this respect, it is essential that people try to adhere as much as practically possible to existing guidelines, namely, use of face masks, maintaining social distancing, and working from home wherever possible.\u0027The growth rate reflects how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day and, as the number of infections decreases, it is a way of keeping track of the virus. If it is greater than zero, and therefore positive, then the disease will grow, and if the growth rate is less than zero, then the disease will shrink.  Meanwhile, an interactive map which highlights coronavirus deaths by postcode in England and Wales reveals people in the North West were dying from coronavirus at more than double the rate of those in London in June. The map, which uses Office for National Statistics data, shows that one in 20 fatalities in the capital last month were caused by Covid-19, down from a staggering one in two at the height of the crisis in April.But in the North West, where several Lancashire towns are being kept under review for potential local lockdowns amid rising cases, one in eight deaths were attributed to the virus in June, down from more than one in three at the peak. The death rates were nine Covid-19 fatalities per 100,000 people in the North West and 3.1 per 100,000 in London. Despite seemingly having shut out the virus, London has still suffered the highest Covid-19 death rate of any area in the UK due to how hard it was hit by the disease early on in the crisis. The capital recorded 141.8 Covid-19 deaths per 100,000 people between March and June, which is significantly higher than the 88 deaths per 100,000 average seen across England and Wales. The North West has been the second worst-hit area in the UK, recording 108.9 deaths per capita, closely followed by the North East (104.9) and West Midlands (100.2).Nine of the 10 local areas with the highest virus death rates in the UK are London boroughs, with Brent suffering 216.6 deaths per 100,000 people, followed by Newham (201.6) and Haringey (185.1).   Middlesbrough (178 deaths per 100,000), Hertsmere in Hertfordshire (166.7) and Salford, Manchester, (166.2) have suffered the three highest death rates outside of London as the epidemic continues to bombard the north.  But all corners of the country have seen a decline in death rates since May, with fatalities plummeting by four-fifths thanks to the strict lockdown that was enforced on March 24. The greatest decrease in deaths was observed in London, where the mortality rate fell by 96.7 per cent. A separate report has added further weight to a trend throughout the outbreak showing that death rates in poorer areas are significantly higher than in wealthy postcodes. In the poorest, there have been an average 139 fatalities per 100,000 people, up from 63 per 100,000 in the richest areas.

But where better to discover the true meaning of a changed world?When Tate Modern first opened its doors 20 years ago, modern life seemed comparatively benign. At the opening party, JG Ballard looked on ironically from a balcony as a brass band played acid house anthems and shiny happy people queued to climb a Louise Bourgeois tower. It is about to open again. But the world has changed utterly – and quickly. Walking through the City to get to the post-lockdown press preview, I kept passing boarded-up champagne bars and To Let signs on glass buildings. Approaching the London museum I heard drums and chanting – a celebratory live art happening as Tate prepares to receive visitors for the first time since March? No. It was a demonstration by workers in Tate’s commercial arm whose jobs are under threat.But when the normal fails, there is always modern art. So much of the greatest art in Tate Modern was made in times of crisis and terror. Out of 20th-century war, mass unemployment and dictatorships came shocking visions. I followed one of two routes you can now take through the museum – this one leads through its collection, past the Warhol exhibition that opened shortly before lockdown, and now gets a second bite.First stop on the ghost train: Picasso’s 1925 masterpiece Three Dancers, a modern danse macabre cut through by savage intimations of the grave. Looking straight through the frenzied movement of gyrating jazz-age hedonists, Picasso sees bones and rot. One dancer has a skull bursting out of her face, with a void for a nose (maybe too much of that 1920s cocaine) and a hole where her heart should be.Next, Salvador Dalí’s Autumnal Cannibalism confirms that Picasso was right to feel his world was headed into madness and catastrophe. It is 1936 and Spain’s civil war is, for Dalí, the spectacle of a conjoined couple tucking into one another’s flesh with knives and forks as their boneless forms sag on crutches. By the time Mark Rothko painted his Seagram Murals in 1958, the descent into irrationality had killed millions. Dark towers of smoke hover against purple. His paint is a tornado, a thunderstorm, an apocalyptic cloud. I’ve got to find some relief.But there isn’t any. The Andy Warhol show starts out nicely enough, with childhood photos and his tender drawings that present the artist as “a shy, gay man from a religious, migrant, low income household” in the words of the press release. But bad Andy, morbid Andy, voyeuristic Andy soon surfaces from this wholesome persona. An evil force pulls you towards his Death and Disaster paintings with their cruel yet hypnotic eye for meaningless suffering.Two people lie in an upside down crashed car. Their plight is repeated in multiple renderings of the same image, transferred to silkscreen ink from a tabloid news photo. You just have to look. She seems dead. He appears to be crawling to safety. The caption explains they both survived, but Warhol doesn’t see it that way. He sees death. He sees it again in a painting of a woman falling from a tall building – falling again and again and again, suspended timelessly in the sky in the last moments of her life.Perhaps the work that brings most shudders of recognition is his 1963 silkscreen canvas Pink Race Riot (Red Race Riot). Here, too, his eye seems cold. He has set a series of news images from Life magazine in a lush rose wash. They show the Alabama police setting dogs on civil rights marchers. Warhol shows black protesters repeatedly being bitten by dogs. Whose side is he on? Why has he called this police brutality a “race riot”? But then you notice the anguished faces of observers, and the almost demonic demeanour of the cops. His objectivity makes this a moving and true painting of American history. Warhol is a virtue hider. You need to go the journey of apparent evil his art enacts to get to the good in it.Emerging into the Turbine Hall, you can’t miss Kara Walker’s Fons Americanus, her gigantic, tottering parody of a Victorian fountain. Its satire seems even more viciously powerful than it did before the recent toppling of statues of slavers and Confederate generals. Walker has imagined, I see now, the kind of sculpture the apologists of slavery and empire might have created if they were honest. It is an explosion of the racial unconscious, bursting with demeaning caricatures, lynchings and waiting sharks. A survivor of this monstrous wreck fends off the sharks in his small boat. It has a name on its stern: the K West.Walker’s sculpture couldn’t be a public artwork. It would be too weird and open to misinterpretation. It belongs in a museum – in this museum, with its 20-year story of championing the new. Tate Modern has never been a relaxing place to visit. But we’ve never needed its clear eye for the restless more than we do now, as we learn the true meaning of modern times."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4bbf56c9a4f1dc046709abc60d9efaa50dcd664/0_269_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9348d455bacdb17dc6cce93d3fce8d6","title":"geisha life in the shadow of coronavirus in pictures","story":"Though the number of geisha - professional entertainers famed for their witty conversation, beauty and skill at traditional arts - has been falling for years, many have now been without work for months due to Japan’s state of emergency and now have to operate under awkward social distancing rules"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf1e5b9748665ee4f96258c4bd0aa1c0d902eafd/0_0_3346_2101/master/3346.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=375fec1752419492f786f52094a6364a 1320w","title":"a change to the zodiac this should never have been written into the stars","story":"There has been a lot of talk about the Ophiuchus constellation joining the zodiac, but I won’t be changing my Cancerian waysI am zodiac person.

Reading it is like watching (or being) someone trying to sprint to the top of an Escher staircase.With its unmistakable obsessive-compulsive aesthetic, it could only have sprung from the head of Charlie Kaufman. There is the magnificent joke-telling stamina working against a constant crisis-of-faith undertow, which whispers that all comedy is futile and dishonest. There is the metafictional self-awareness and incessant autoreferencing of real movie celebrities and writers, including of course a despised “Charlie Kaufman”. There is Kaufman’s fascination with the false promise of cinema – of all art – that human existence can be represented he catches himself in the act of thinking about his own existence, and then in the act of thinking about thinking about his own existence.And perhaps most of all there is Kaufman’s preoccupation with puppetry: the naive artform which is so wrong, because silly, jerky puppets can’t fairly represent human beings, but also so right, because all of us are silly, indistinguishable little puppets, each bizarrely convinced of our own compelling iniduality.The hero of our story is B Rosenberger Rosenberg, a film critic in his late 50s, who in time-honoured style is a pathetic, pompous loser. B is painfully progressive in his attitudes, especially in his obsessive use of the nonbinary pronoun “thon”, but manages to be artlessly offensive about everyone. Nobody cares what he thinks and the only outlet for his opinions is his utterly unregarded blog, in which he gives condescending two-star reviews to the work of his estranged film-maker daughter, who is creatively driven by her loathing of him. And then B befriends an ancient recluse in Florida called Ingo Cutbirth, who shows him the epic stop-motion puppet animation he has been secretly filming in his tiny apartment all his life. It is three months long, and apart from its creator, B is the only person ever to have seen it. B is electrified by this discovery of a primitive masterpiece that could finally make his name, and like Max Brod with Kafka disobeys Cutbirth’s dying wish that the film be destroyed. He carelessly loads the thousands of reels and innumerable boxes of meticulously crafted puppets into a hired van and sets off home, intending to show the film, write about it, and bathe in the glory of being sole proprietor of a precious, unique work of genius. But B is apparently unaware, despite all his cinematic expertise, of what can happen to old nitrate film stock when it is exposed to the open air. The resulting catastrophe sends him on a terrifying journey down the rabbit hole of his mind, where imagination and reality merge, to finally confront a giant symbolic ant.It’s a gigantic book, crammed with insanely creative gags, though these thin towards the end the material about Trump is a bit stale. Yet Kaufman gouges the reader for laughs with expert force. B has an awful habit of getting his cultural references wrong, perhaps through incipient dementia, or perhaps because he occupies an alternative universe in which they are correct: “‘Are you talking to me?’ I say, reminding myself of Robert De Niro in the TV series Taxi.” (A film version of Antkind will have to use top-of-the-range digital tech to put De Niro’s Travis Bickle into the same room as the youthful Judd Hirsch and Danny DeVito.)He is also obsessed with the work of bro-comedy maestro Judd Apatow, whose films (some imaginary) he is always putting in his insufferably hipster “best of the year” lists. Perhaps Kaufman despises Apatow – a distinct possibility – or perhaps he is amused at the business of solemnly analysing commercial comedy product. But B’s misremembered dialogue from Apatow’s film This Is 40 is both surreal and hilarious (though perhaps a bit niche for many readers).Finally Antkind comes to its crazy, hellzapocalypticpoppin ending, and this twilight of the puppet-gods dwindles into darkness, leaving me with the punchdrunk feeling I have after all Kaufmans’s movies. He may be someone for whom anxiety and sadness are a personal ordeal, but he transforms them into bleak, stark, unearthly monuments to comic despair.• Antkind is published by 4th Estate (£18.99).

The project will now proceed to all-important phase 3 trials in Brazil and South Africa to test if it actually stops infection.For a global population that has seen its movement curtailed and its health threatened, it was a welcome dose of good news. It is also a large feather in the cap for AstraZeneca, whose boss, Pascal Soriot, will unveil financial results for the first half of 2020 on Thursday.However, AstraZeneca’s share price actually fell in the week following the announcement (after initially surging). While billions of pounds of government funding mean it won’t lose out, AstraZeneca has pledged not to profit from any vaccine. Similar pledges, and the deep uncertainties around all drug development, have raised the question of which pharma companies will come out ahead on the other side of the pandemic.AstraZeneca’s first-quarter numbers were solid thanks to government stockpiling of medicines. Investors will be looking at whether that benefit is starting to diminish or even go into reverse. But perhaps more important will be news of the sales of AZ’s blockbuster oncology drugs, which are finally paying off years after Soriot launched an investment push, as well as its continued determination to pay a idend at a time when other sectors are on the retreat.GSK is also working with French competitor Sanofi on a Covid-19 vaccine in a deal described by GSK boss Emma Walmsley as “unprecedented”. Investor interest in the moves of vaccine makers is reaching levels rarely seen, a phenomenon also visible in the share prices of the manufacturers of potential treatments for Covid-19 witness the rocketing share price of British biotech company Synairgen after what appear to be promising trials of an immunosuppressant drug.That scramble is also evident in the unseemly haste of rich-world governments to elbow out possible competitors for vaccine doses. The Trump administration has committed to buy £2bn worth of doses from another German biotech, BioNTech, and the US pharma giant Pfizer. The UK is seeking to secure a supply of as many as 12 different vaccines to hedge its bets.The huge interest in drug companies’ efforts means the pandemic does offer the pharmaceutical industry as a whole a golden opportunity: a chance to show that it can heal its customers rather than just emptying their wallets (or contributing to their premature deaths, in the case of the opioid epidemic in the US).But until we have a set of firm results, it will be as hard to predict the financial winners of the pandemic as it is the behaviour of the human body. As analysts at UBS noted: “Unfortunately, the human immune system is not simple – if it was we wouldn’t have made it very far.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/720257605dd919e70078b77c9fceaa39c2fd77a2/0_200_5993_3595/master/5993.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a27cd18fc5ee2563b32ba542c66a1ce","title":"i cannot wait england gym goers and swimmers react to reopenings coronavirus","story":"After months of coronavirus hibernation, people can start to return to normalityThe closure of gyms and imposition of lockdown measures dictating that people could only exercise outside of their homes by jogging or cycling wreaked havoc with workout routines across England.But with the reopening of indoor gyms, swimming pools and sports halls on Saturday, following more than four months of hibernation, many people’s lives will be able to continue to edge back to normal.Mason will be eagerly heading back to his gym in Malvern as soon as possible after sorely missing being able to swim and use the squat rack.Perhaps even more so, he has missed socialising with fellow gym-goers, although he is also slightly apprehensive because of the absence of a proper coronavirus contact tracing system.Mason exercised in his local park most days after lockdown began but he found it increasingly difficult to motivate himself because “there is only so much variation you can achieve without equipment” and he did not want to “shell out” on sets of weights.“A pool adds so much variety to workouts,” he added. “Not just to the muscles exercised but to the entire experience of being in contact with the world.”Mackenzie is also excited to return to her gym at the earliest opportunity, after leading what she described as a rather sedentary existence in recent months despite taking up horseriding again.“Mental health has been one of the biggest casualties of this pandemic and I know that swimming, exercising on cardio machines and using free weights helps me to manage mine,” she said.“I can’t afford to buy the equipment and machines myself and I am recovering from an ankle injury, which means that I cannot currently run, and the gym and pool have been incredibly important for my physical rehab, too.”She has been assured by the efforts of her gym, which was used by a local food bank during its closure, to keep its members updated with developments.“Of course I’ve got concerns but everything I’ve heard from my gym shows they’re taking it very seriously and are putting all the guidelines into place to ensure we can return safely,” she said.“I cannot wait, it’s a little bit of normality, but if I go there and it doesn’t look great I might reconsider.”Bullock is planning to do cardiovascular exercise on Saturday, weights on Sunday and swimming on Monday, after pre-booking a maximum three sessions. But he is frustrated it has taken this long to sanction the reopening of the gyms.“While an obvious need existed to close gyms, pools and sports halls during the initial several weeks of the lockdown, it is absurd that they have remained closed for a period in excess of four months.”A keen cyclist, he has been riding up to 200 miles a week, along with hundreds of sit-ups, press-ups and star jumps at home to keep fit. But because of the measures taken by his gym, he will still have to do part of his routine at home.“We’re only going to be allowed to use the gym and pool for 45 minutes in total, which is more than a nuisance,” he said.“Its a very short time. But it’s better than nothing. Still, I’ll be speaking to people on Saturday and we’ll try to persuade them to let us use it for an hour and a half.”Some people, such as Burgess, remain anxious. “I have just cancelled my gym membership,” she said on Wednesday, after it became active again following the lockdown period when it was frozen.While her concerns have eased over the virus, which she found “very scary” at the beginning of the pandemic since her husband has an underlying heart condition, she believes that a return to the gym would currently be premature for her. Perhaps within a few months she may feel it is the right time, she said.“I was mainly using it for yoga and fitness classes but I just don’t feel ready to be in that sort of space with no windows or access to open air yet. It would just feel very claustrophobic and sterile.”Burgess has throughout lockdown continued with her own yoga practice of 40-minute sessions around five times a week either in her living room or her garden, plus an hour’s walk.“I’m probably as fit as I’ve ever been in my life,” she added. “But it is harder without a teacher there to observe and correct, and it’s just not the same without the social aspect – practising with others and chatting after class. It’s a pity not to be having that.”Robinson also cancelled his gym membership, at the beginning of lockdown, but does not intend to return at any stage after repurposing his bedroom into a personal workout space by erecting a calisthenics station.“I definitely won’t be going back,” he said. “I just don’t feel like the gym any more, I’ve been drawn to other stuff during lockdown. Plus, I turned my lockdown prison into a gym and a yoga studio.“Not having access to gym equipment and weights has forced me to do bodyweight workouts and I’ve become much stronger than I’ve ever been from lifting barbells.”Plus, he saves on the costs of the gym, after an initial outlay on equipment, which he said cost him the equivalent of three months of gym fees.“I’m just going to keep adding to what I’ve got here,” he said, conceding that he has fears over what the vibe might be like in his old gym.“I imagine it might be a bit weird and potentially hostile. People have different hygiene standards, some breathe more deeply and sweat more than others. I do miss the sauna though.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aecd4271b2d9e281087cd36bf3780878feb727a1/0_0_5037_3023/master/5037.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17a0476a4896f6d8259d635548ba5011","title":"public leisure centres england remain shut funds dry up covid lockdown finances","story":"Future of many council-owned sites hangs in balance as covid lockdown tips finances into redApproximately a third of England’s public leisure centres will remain closed on Saturday as a widespread picture of financial distress among community leisure operators overshadows the long-awaited reopening of gyms and indoor swimming pools.While privately owned chains such as PureGym, David Lloyd and Virgin Active are eager to proceed with opening plans, the charitable trusts behind the country’s 2,116 council-owned sites, are being circumspect as coronavirus restrictions tip their finances into the red.Jane Parish, the chief executive of Sencio, which runs three leisure centres and a golf course in Kent, said the future of its facilities was hanging in the balance after it ran out of cash during the quarantine period.“We’ve been losing £100,000 a week of income but have still been incurring costs maintaining our buildings,” she said. “We’ve got no reserves left whatsoever.”Parish said the need to limit visitor numbers meant Sencio would be making a loss when it opens its centres on 3 August.Sencio has 11,500 members but its gyms and pools are popular with over-70s, some of whom were reluctant to return yet. It will take until early 2021 for income to reach even two-thirds of pre-pandemic levels, she predicts and is applying for a £700,000 emergency loan to tide it over.“We applied for a business interruption loan with our bank but didn’t get it because they wanted security, which our council wouldn’t give us,” said Parish. “I employ 343 staff. That’s a lot of staff and livelihoods could be in jeopardy.”She said “we won’t survive” if the loan request was later declined.The UK has about 7,200 gyms and leisure centres, with approximately two-thirds run privately and the rest by councils or operators on their behalf.Before the pandemic 10.4 million people had memberships but some of the large chains have reported losing up to a fifth of their clientele as Britons reined in spending during lockdown.After a frustrating delay – gyms had hoped to reopen alongside England’s pubs and hotels – popular chains such as PureGym, David Lloyd and Virgin Active are champing at the bit despite the financial implications of half empty gyms, smaller exercise classes and expensive cleaning regimes. A date is yet to be set for gyms, leisure centres and swimming pools in Scotland and Wales to open, while facilities in Northern Ireland were allowed to open on 10 July.The sports minister, Nigel Huddleston, said: “Given the huge benefits exercise has for physical and mental health, I know people across the country can’t wait to get back to the gym.“But it’s vital that users feel safe. That’s why we have worked hard with the sector to make sure they have the guidance they need to put strict safety measures in place.”“Fitness is a successful growth business but this has been an enormous shock,” Earlam said. “We have survived four months of closure and we will be fine, providing people come back come back in normal numbers, even if it takes us a while to build back the volume we have lost.”The shift to working from home is also creating opportunities for the upmarket chain, with its spacious centres and free wifi. Several companies have inquired about corporate memberships whereby staff could base themselves at a David Lloyd club.However, there is a concern that nearly half of Britain’s public leisure centres will not be able to stay the course, meaning even those that open their doors in the coming days could be forced to close again.“We have acute cashflow issues and are totally and utterly dependent on support from a council facing its own challenges,” said Chris Rushton, the chief executive of Active Tameside, which runs eight leisure centres in Greater Manchester. “We will open on a vastly restricted capacity and lose money as the furlough scheme winds down.”Rushton added: “Swathes of our sector are at risk. Not everything will reopen, and not everything that opens will be the same as it was previously. We are a sector that is delivering untold health and social impact and that is what is in danger here.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dba558f9dbec4f414993610194da89378e456ca6/31_0_4260_2557/master/4260.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=b43f992b3c29f90669b80634d0ad10ba","title":"the covid 19 facemask rules complicated mask coffee shop takeaway","story":"Should you wear a mask in a coffee shop? What about a takeaway? If you’re finding it confusing, there is one simple approach to follow Masks became mandatory in a range of public places in England on Friday, after a long hiatus during which government ministers couldn’t agree on what to do about them. The list of places is explicable but not intuitive: you should wear a mask in shops and supermarkets, and also in takeaways and coffee shops, but not if you are sitting at a table to eat or drink.A friend runs a bar that also sells records, and explains patiently when people go in that if they’re having a beer, they don’t have to mask up if they’re buying a record, they do. If they’re drinking a beer while browsing for records, they can remain face-naked until they buy a record, then they have to put a mask on, unless they want another beer. I can easily imagine people going there deliberately to make some kind of mask statement, but then my friend will sell more beer, so what’s the harm?The sanction is a £100 fine, and nobody wants to police it: not the police, not supermarkets – Sainsbury’s and Asda have already refused. Certainly, without an enforcement army, it’s hard to see how many £100 fines the government will collect, but beyond that, worriers are underestimating the force of a dirty look.The bigger threat to the success of Project Mask are the inevitable bids to turn it into a badge of political identity, whether by the libertarian right (“masks destroy the economy!”) or the statist left (“wear a mask to signify your belief that the government is failing”). There is no politics here there is only the one person you might meet, who has to do their job, who would prefer you to wear a mask. It doesn’t matter if they aren’t wearing one. It doesn’t matter if there’s only one of him or her in your entire day, or what the science says, or whether you have read the metastudies. If one person on a till, who has to serve 150 people a day, would prefer you to be masked, that satisfies the basic demands of courtesy, and everything else is noise."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d16e3334a3e7a05ff9198631860f884948e89dc/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=5c76f3c897f02aa7019ff9e792cd3378","title":"schoolgirls in england have you been informally excluded","story":"We’d like to hear from girls – or their parents – who have been excluded from a school in England via informal methods Girls are being informally excluded at a higher rate than boys from some schools in England, according to a study by not-for-profit group Social Finance.While boys are much more likely to be formally excluded, research shows girls are being excluded through moves to other schools or by leaving one school before the end of year 11 and not finishing their studies elsewhere.

Virtually, of course. They’ll talk for 10 minutes on a What’sApp video call and follow up with texts. A real-life meeting will happen in a fortnight or so, then love, and their lives will fold into a magical future in which parent-teacher evenings will always trump over a romantic night in but, in mitigation, long summers will be spent on sun-kissed beaches without a care in the world.That is the theory. The reality is that on Friday 31 July Kate, a teaching assistant, will take part in a speed dating event for education workers. It is the fifth time she’ll have joined the matchmaking session but she is undaunted: she has a good feeling this time around.In this era of restricted socialising, it is always a lot of old-fashioned fun, she says. “One guy I met on a call had lined up numbered shot glasses, and got me to pick one. I got him the vodka (the other glasses contained water) and we had a good old chat – it was a great icebreaker.”Edudate, as the dating service Kate uses is niftily named, is the idea of a secondary school history teacher, Tom Rogers. Currently between contracts, the pandemic has left Rogers with time on his hands and, as a 35-year-old singleton with some tricky break-ups in his slipstream, he was aware that being an educational professional brought particular strains when it came to falling in love.“There are a lot of lonely teachers out there,” he says. “And with the pandemic, many are on their own much of the time and their only contact is with the children they’re teaching, so they need adult company.”So far, more than 1,400 people have signed up on Edudate. The only requirement, Rogers says, is that they work in education. “That doesn’t just mean teachers, although of course many of our members are. But we also welcome people who work in educational administration, in school support, in universities and in colleges. Women outnumber men because of the demographics of primary teaching, but we have more and more men signing up.”He says: “Registration is free, although if you pay a £4 fee you’ll be prioritised for a place on the date nights. What happens is that I go through all the sign-ups, and organise people depending on their age, their orientation, and their regional location.” So far, at least five couples are in relationships – and they include Marina, 25, and Mark, 33 (not their real names). The pair chatted for the first time on the third Edudate session, on 16 May. “I felt the chemistry instantly. Mark is funny, warm and clever. He’s a science teacher, he’s intelligent and nerdy, and that’s totally my kind of guy,” says Marina.The two teachers kept the social distancing regulations to the letter. “On our first date we had a socially distanced picnic. After that we went for walks and it was very strange not being able to touch. At times it was frustrating, but there was also something old-fashioned about it – and that seemed a strange paradox given we’d met in such a modern way.”Edudate, Marina says, was the perfect intervention in her love life at the perfect moment. “Because of coronavirus it’s been hard to get out and meet people, and the problem with using a general online dating service, and meeting someone who’s not a teacher, is that it brings frustrations like the fact that you’re very busy during term time, but have long holidays.“I didn’t want to date someone at my own school, but I loved the idea of meeting another teacher: you tend to have the same sort of baseline values, which is so important.”The pair are soon heading off on holiday. “Love in a time of coronavirus means we’ve moved fast,” says Marina. “I’ve even joked with Mark that if we get married, we’ll have to invite Tom to be our best man.” She is, she says, “very optimistic” about the future, and is keeping Edudate apprised of developments.Laura and Alex, 32 and 29 respectively, are another success story. “We met in the Edudate session on 6 June,” says Laura. “Just ahead of our video call I texted Alex to say I was incredibly nervous, and from the second I saw him he put me at my ease. He looked exactly like the sort of person I’d been looking for: he’s very kind, and that came across straight away.”After their WhatsApp chat Laura discovered Alex on Twitter – Edudate events tend to take place in a flurry of social media excitement – and discovered he had been saying he’d had a “standout date’” and “fingers crossed for the matching”.“Later on I asked him whether that girl he had the standout date with had matched with him – and he admitted it was me,” says Laura. “He’s going to meet my parents this weekend, and I’m planning to meet his soon.” Like Marina, she says Covid-19 has moved the romance on more quickly than would usually be the case: “Lockdown hasn’t all been bad, because we’ve had this going on.”Alex, a science teacher, meanwhile, says he had had doubts about the wisdom of dating someone who worked in the same field. “I thought teaching would be all we’d talk about, but it’s not been like that – in our first chat we were talking about what things had been like in lockdown, and the fact that she comes from the north-east and that’s where my family are from. And the benefits are huge: we have similar holiday opportunities, and we understand one another’s stresses and strains.”Like Marina and Mark, Alex and Laura are planning to spend the summer together.So what is Rogers’s secret in bringing members of his profession together, and will he use it to find a new partner himself? “At the moment it’s too full-on,” he says. “This is a hobby for me, not a career, but date days are very busy and I couldn’t manage it if I was trying to do some dating myself.”He puts his success down to its human face. “A lot of dating services are anonymous, but mine is very approachable, and I’m a real inidual and I’m also a teacher,” he says. “I think putting people together when they’ve got so much common ground is a recipe for things going well: people who work in education have similar values, common experiences and the same sort of lifestyle, and that ups the chance of things working out.”Which explains why Kate’s hopes are high for 31 July. And even if she doesn’t find someone then, she will be back the next week. Edudate, she says, is lots of fun. “I usually go to watch rugby, and I’m out socialising in clubs,” she says. “And while that’s not possible, the date nights are a really good way to pass the time, even if it takes a while to find the perfect partner.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c94ee8406471f302ce420acc7349206fd38e352c/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f158200ebd3b1441031ca4deff47aade","title":"british birds long distance feats are tracked thanks to ring","story":"Data comes from rings on birds, with more than a million fitted during 2019Flying around the world may have become an unappealing prospect or a distant dream for most people during the coronavirus crisis.If you are a Manx shearwater, however, there is no limit to your long-distance travel, and one of these small seabirds from the Hebridean isle of Rùm was last year clocked journeying more than 7,564 miles from its Scottish breeding colony to the seaside resort of Las Grutas in Argentina.An arctic skua from Scotland flew to Brazil – a straight line of 6,845 miles – while a swallow covered at least 6,400 to reach South Africa. A sanderling and a sandwich tern also made journeys of a similar length from Britain to South Africa.The records were collected thanks to uniquely numbered rings fitted by volunteers to more than 1 million birds in Britain during 2019, enabling iniduals to be identified for the rest of their lives.The records, collected by the British Trust for Ornithology, provide insights into the remarkable migrations of birds but also the human and climatic pressures they face – and their longevity.Several species set new age records in 2019, including a fulmar humanely caught on Scotland’s Sanda Island found to have a ring that was placed around its leg 41 years, 11 months and 17 days earlier. A siskin captured and ring-checked near the village of Tarbet in Argyll and Bute was found to have been ringed at the same site in 2010, making it the oldest known inidual of its species.A 50-year-old Manx shearwater caught by a ringer on Bardsey Island in Wales in 2008 holds the record as the longest-living wild bird in Britain after being ringed on the same small island in 1957.“Without fitting birds with uniquely numbered rings and monitoring their nests we wouldn’t be able to follow their lives and our knowledge of them would be much poorer,” said Rob Robinson of the BTO.“The data gathered by our fantastic volunteers help us to determine whether species are in trouble and, if they are, at what point of the lifecycle the problems are occurring.”Of 1,047,521 ringed birds, the most-ringed species was the blue tit, not known for its epic migrations. Second was the blackcap, traditionally a summer migrant which is now increasingly seen during winter because of global heating and the lure of garden bird feeders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/62af58d0398584663c846f039fc00b480d4f68f7/0_160_4707_2826/master/4707.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c3691768d78edb469a2d027a6e747210","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The pick of the world’s best flora and fauna photos, including hillstar hummingbirds and one-horned rhinos"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0d9fd07e10b2bf7d2fa4da5bc167053acf2525d/902_498_4102_2461/master/4102.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=f054dc1842d8acfb563d49aac0896153","title":"streaming barbican cinema on demand bjork juniper tree","story":"Offering such choice picks as Björk’s screen debut, the Barbican’s new bijou streaming service is the latest addition to the roster of smaller British streaming platforms After four long months of home entertainment under lockdown, any new streaming service, big or boutique, feels like a treat to be seized upon. However seemingly infinite the options on Netflix or Amazon Prime, it’s hard to escape the feeling that you’ve cycled blearily through their loops of content one too many times: any new interface, with a different range of selections, acts as a kind of palate cleanser for the eyes.Launched earlier this month, the Barbican’s new Cinema on Demand facility does that job, albeit with the most dainty of set menus. The latest arts institution to embrace the possibilities of streaming under the current crisis, the Barbican has neatly transferred the programming scale and sensibility of its on-site cinema to the digital realm: kicking off with just five films, it rather feels as if you’re choosing from what’s on their physical screens. (There’s no subscription: you simply pay for 48-hour access to each inidual film.) As you’d find at their cinemas, too, what’s on is a mixture of classy new arthouse and older or more esoteric offerings that you might struggle to find elsewhere.On the former front they’ve got A White, White Day, Icelandic director Hlynur Pálmason’s lean, mean mixture of chilly procedural and hot-blooded melodrama (for which I echo my colleague Simran Hans’s enthusiasm some weeks back), as well as the slick, high-intrigue documentary Spaceship Earth.But it’s away from the new releases where things get really interesting. Boldly, they’ve complemented Pálmason’s film with a wildly different flavour of the Icelandic fjords: the wholly unique 1990 fairytale The Juniper Tree, by the late American director Nietzchka Keene. An under-the-radar Sundance premiere 30 years ago, it’s now best remembered as the first film to star Björk – here credited as Björk Guðmundsdóttir – a few years before she attained solo pop stardom. Rereleased in the US last year following a diamond-sharp 4K restoration, it now arrives as an enchanting discovery to most of us.Based on a Grimm brothers tale of the same title, and honouring the original visceral nature of their storytelling without any Disney-approved sweetening, the film follows two newly orphaned sisters travelling the wilds of medieval Iceland, surviving on the powers of witchcraft that got their mother burnt at the stake. With its tough outlook and its serene, Dreyer-like visual austerity, it’s not really for kids, though there is a creeping, sprightly magic to it – a spirit the Barbican has extended by pairing it on the streaming bill with an eerie, mythology-concerned four-minute reading by the young British poet Annie Hayter.Parents in search of unusual entertainment for little ones might be better off with the hour-long ABsolutely Amazing Shorts programme, a collection of five short films from the Latvian stop-motion animation company AB Studios. Beguilingly rustic in style, all in thumb-printed clay with wood-fired colours, they tell punchy, whimsical little stories – a tiger escapes from the zoo, a family of peas is pursued by a caterpillar – with a dry, droll sense of humour. Give it a whirl: at worst, your kids can call them the best Latvian cartoons they’ve ever seen.The Barbican’s lineup is rounded out with Retablo, a moving, unadorned Peruvian queer drama in which a naive rural teenager discovers his father’s closeted secret. It nabbed a Bafta nomination earlier this year, but never got a proper UK release. Here it is, with a free digital Q\u0026ampA with director Álvaro Delgado Aparicio taking place on Monday .All in all, the Barbican service is a promising addition to the roster of smaller independent streaming platforms from British arts bodies and distributors. These range from the ever-growing arthouse bastion of Curzon Home Cinema to Dogwoof’s simple Watch page for their past and present documentary releases to the fledgling service offered by indie company Modern Films. The latter currently boasts a 26-film menu running the gamut from last week’s standout Clemency to the surprisingly superb Sienna Miller showcase American Woman to Alice Rohrwacher’s rapturous Happy as Lazzaro. If you’re suffering from Netflix fatigue, a bit of discerning downsizing might be the answer.A Rainy Day in New York (Signature, 12) Another year, another exceedingly minor Woody Allen trifle: professing to centre on the romantic travails of the posh college set, it could hardly feel less youthful. Points to Elle Fanning, gamely trying to forge a character from cotton wool.Georgy Girl (Powerhouse, 15) As a swinging London time capsule, this reissued 1966 coming-of-age comedy is immaculate. As a film, it’s now a mixture of creaky and spry: its gender politics have aged unsurprisingly badly, but Lynn Redgrave’s breakout performance is still daisy-fresh.The Game (Arrow, 15) Written off by many as a peculiar disappointment on its 1997 release, David Fincher’s beautiful, meticulous puzzle has steadily gained in stature over the years – as shown by this lavish limited-edition reissue, tricked out with critical commentaries and a 200-page hardback tome in its honour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce261704007192e3324045cd06e560c0f51490ee/0_695_1946_1167/master/1946.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=9b3fd5b63c543781c5a9c925b776e93c","title":"yotam ottolenghi recipes for summery green side dishes","story":"Summery greens for all ages: beans braised with tomato and garlic, broad beans and herb salad doused in garlicky sauce, and Mediterranean-style chard with tomatoes and olivesGoing by my experiences with young ones, I am not entirely sure that the whole Popeye and spinach campaign was strictly necessary. Yes, green vegetables weren’t my children’s first dinner choice when they were very young, but, as they get older, they take much less encouragement at least to try them.The thing about green food is, it tells you where it’s going to take you, depending on where it lands on the colour spectrum: deeper shades mean it’s likely to be complex and earthy, while lighter ones tend to be more vibrant and fresh. Kids get that, so they often start with peas, broad beans or courgettes, before venturing on to the darker leaves and peppery herbs.We are not quite there yet in my house, but I can almost see a future in which the command, “Eat your greens!” gets a wholehearted, “Gladly!”in response.This summery side dish really benefits from using top-quality ripe tomatoes. If you can’t find rainbow chard, use swiss chard instead and cut the stalks a little smaller. This is great served warm, but it also sits well for serving at room temperature. Prep 25 minCook 40 minServes 4 as a side400g rainbow chard, bases trimmed, leaves and stalks separated and each cut into 6cm-long pieces125ml olive oil5 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced1 small onion, peeled and finely chopped (110g net weight)1 lemon – skin pared off in 2 strips, then juiced, to get 1 tbsp2-3 sprigs fresh oregano300g ripe plum tomatoes (ie, about 2-3), cut into 1cm dice Salt and pepper120g nocellara (or other green) olives, pitted and halved (or quartered if large)1 tbsp (5g) basil leaves, roughly tornCut any wider chard stalks in half lengthways (or three times, if they are especially wide). Put a large saute pan on a medium-high heat with a teaspoon of oil, add the chard stalks and saute, stirring occasionally, for four minutes. Stir in the leaves and saute for another three minutes, until just wilted and cooked. Transfer to a large bowl, cover with a plate, leave for three minutes to soften further in the residual heat, then remove the plate.Wipe clean the chard pan, pour in 90ml oil and return to a medium heat. Once hot, add the garlic, onion, lemon peel and oregano, and fry gently, stirring often, for 12 minutes, until the onion is soft and golden. Add the tomatoes, half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for about two minutes (or a couple of minutes longer if the tomatoes are not that ripe), until the tomatoes are just beginning to soften. Stir in the cooked chard and the olives, turn off the heat and leave to sit for five minutes, so the flavours come together.Pick out and discard the spent oregano stalks and lemon peel, then transfer the chard and tomatoes to a lipped platter. Drizzle over the lemon juice and the remaining two tablespoons of oil, finish with a scattering of the torn basil leaves and a good grind of pepper, and serve.Braised green beans in tomato sauce are eaten throughout the Middle East, cooked with or without meat, and usually eaten with rice. Cooking down the beans in this way means they lose that bright green hue, but it does make them wonderfully soft and comforting. Omit the chilli for a more child-friendly version, if you prefer. Prep 15 minCook 55 minServes 4 as a side150g datterini (or cherry) tomatoes550g vine tomatoes (ie, about 4-5), roughly chopped120ml olive oil1 onion, peeled, halved and finely sliced (180g net weight)10 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced8 cardamom pods, lightly bashed open in a mortar or with the flat of a knife1½ tsp ground cumin½ tsp chilli flakesSalt and black pepper450g green beans, trimmed and cut in half at an angle4 tbsp (15g) roughly chopped coriander, plus extra picked leaves to servePut a large saute pan for which you have a lid on a high heat. Once very hot, add the datterini tomatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, for five minutes, until well charred all over. Transfer to a bowl and leave the pan to cool down slightly.Meanwhile, put the chopped vine tomatoes in a food processor, blitz to a puree, and set aside.Return the now-empty tomato pan to a medium-high heat, add five tablespoons of oil and, once hot, stir in the onion and cook, stirring from time to time, for about six minutes, until softened and lightly browned. Add two thirds of the garlic and all the cardamom, cook, stirring occasionally, for two minutes, until the garlic has taken on some colour. Add the spices, cook for 30 seconds, until fragrant, then stir in the blitzed tomatoes, a teaspoon and a half of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook, stirring occasionally, for seven minutes, until thickened. Add 250ml water and cook for eight minutes more, until incorporated.Turn down the heat to medium, add the beans, cover the pan, and leave to cook for 12 minutes. Give everything a stir, add the charred tomatoes, then replace the lid and cook for eight minutes more, until the beans are nice and soft, then stir through the chopped coriander.Meanwhile, put the remaining three tablespoons of oil and the remaining sliced garlic in a small frying pan, put it on a medium heat and cook, stirring occasionally, for about eight minutes. When the garlic is golden and crisp, turn off the heat.Transfer the beans and tomatoes to a large shallow bowl and top with the picked coriander. Spoon over the fried garlic and its oil, and serve at room temperature.Toum is Levantine sauce made by whipping raw garlic and oil. It’s so garlicky that here I’ve blanched half the cloves to take off the edge very slightly. These quantities will make double the amount of toum than you you need here: keep the rest in a sealed jar in the fridge, where it will keep quite happily for up to a week – it goes really well with grilled vegetables or meat, particularly rich and fatty cuts. Prep 25 minCook 20 minServes 4 as a side1 large lemon350g frozen baby broad beans, defrosted and outer skins removed2 heads little baby gem lettuce, core removed and leaves separated10g picked tarragon leaves (ie, from one small bunch)10g picked mint leaves (ie, from one small bunch)10g picked dill leaves (ie, from one small bunch)3 tbsp olive oilFor the toum90g garlic cloves (about 2 whole heads), separated and peeled3½ tbsp lemon juiceSalt and black pepper230ml sunflower oil, or other neutral oil1 tbsp ice-cold waterMake the toum first. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil, add half the garlic cloves and blanch them for 45 seconds: you don’t want them to soften, just to take off their “garlicky” edge. Drain, run under cold water to stop them cooking further, then pat dry. Cut the unblanched cloves in half lengthways and remove and discard the white inner core.Transfer the cored cloves and the blanched cloves to a food processor bowl, add a quarter-teaspoon of salt and two and a half tablespoons of lemon juice, blitz for about three minutes, until very smooth and aerated, stopping to scrape down the bowl a couple times. With the motor still running, very slowly drizzle in a third of the oil, followed by the ice-cold water. Repeat with another third of the oil, then add the remaining tablespoon of lemon juice. Finally, drizzle in and process the last third of the oil. You should be left with a white, fluffy and homogenised mixture. Set aside half the mixture and refrigerate the rest.Segment the lemon by using a small, sharp knife to top and tail it. Cut down around its curves to remove the skin and white pith, then release the segments by cutting between the membranes. Roughly chop the segments into three or four pieces, put them in a large bowl, then squeeze the juice from what’s left of the membrane into the bowl (you want about a teaspoon of juice in all). Add the broad beans, lettuce, herbs, two tablespoons of olive oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and toss to combine.Spread the toum over the base of a large platter, then set the salad slightly to one side.

What did they expect to happen?If only they had known. If only there had been some kind of clue. A recent precedent from which they might have learned a thing or two. A well-documented and much-traduced pandemic-unfriendly, massed gathering of jubilant football fans outside an Anfield-sized, Anfield-shaped football stadium called Anfield, for example. If only.Then maybe, just maybe, the decision-makers at Premier League HQ would have seen incontrovertible evidence that might have helped them to decide upon doing the decent thing. To realise that, in the interests of public health during a global pandemic, staging a trophy presentation inside an Anfield-sized, Anfield-shaped football stadium called Anfield may very well lead to identical scenes.Contrary to the hoary old saw about football without fans being nothing, we have learned in recent weeks that, while far from perfect, it is sometimes marginally better than no football at all. By contrast, trophy handovers without fans, specifically the kind conducted by a couple of men wearing surgical masks, really are nothing if not weird and fecklessly irresponsible on the part of those who gave the go-ahead for them to take place. At some point while looping his bit of PPE kit around his ears, did it not occur to the Premier League chief executive, Richard Masters, that what he was about to do alongside Kenny Dalglish was a terrible idea?He did not need the evidence of the ribald crowd scenes outside Anfield on the night Liverpool’s players won the league in absentia to know a fair old throng of locals would convene when their heroes turned up to collect the silverware. He had it anyway but chose to ignore it, while at Elland Road similar scenes of health-endangering public jubilation unfolded under the banner of the notoriously hapless blazers who run the Football League.In Leeds it was worse, the club everyone used to love to hate but now quite likes having parked a stationary open-top bus outside Elland Road, all the better for their triumphant players to commune with an alarming number of socially undistanced and overjoyed fans who had been repeatedly urged to stay away because – checks official club statement – it would “assist dispersal should a crowd congregate at Elland Road”. No, really. They wrote that.Both sets of fans deserve some sympathy. They have endured long and painful spells in their own particular purgatories and in the case of the former, who in all honesty can blame them for flying in the face of government guidelines and the law to celebrate yet again? These supporters have suffered a fabled 30-year title drought during which the only Premier League trophy they saw presented at Anfield was immediately whisked away on the Blackburn team bus. They are entitled and should be encouraged to enjoy the ceremony that officially marked its conclusion. It is their enablers who deserve our bah-humbuggish opprobrium.While those gathered outside Anfield were having an undeniably good time in the company of like-minded iniduals basking in their team being presented with the Premier League trophy, they would probably have had even more fun if they could have actually seen the moment Jordan Henderson hoisted it skywards in the flesh. Another good reason, perhaps, why the Premier League could have considered postponing their presentation until the occasion of the big knees-up Jürgen Klopp has assured Liverpool supporters they will all be able to enjoy together “when this bullshit virus is gone”.It is perhaps also worth noting Klopp’s mooted party would almost certainly take place a whole lot sooner rather than later if the brains trust at the Premier League and their Football League counterparts had resisted the urge to stage trophy presentations for the benefit of TV cameras that were always going to prompt the kind of illegal mass gatherings in which any bullshit virus worth its salt will inevitably thrive. We have not yet experienced a potentially devastating second wave of infections, but there is no guarantee they are not coming.

In terms of those all important optics, Wednesday night’s festivities in Liverpool and Leeds were anything but a good look for the administrators of the leagues both teams won.But what about the beaches? Eh? And the parks? Why do football and those who follow it invariably find themselves in the firing line when so many others are equally culpable of further endangering public health? They are fair questions and ones worth asking if you subscribe to the bizarre but apparently widely held notion that football fans only like football, beach-goers only like sun, sea and sand, and never the twain shall meet.Well, guess what? A lot of folk have a variety of different interests, including football and beach-going, so it is hardly a massive leap to suggest the intersection of the particular Venn diagram in which both sets feature is decidedly large. While those gathered outside Anfield and Elland Road are undeniably football fans, they are also people some of whom can’t be trusted and who wouldn’t be human if they didn’t feel the urge to celebrate the end of a difficult and emotionally draining job exceptionally well done by their respective teams. It is the football’s authorities at whom we should point our Big Finger of Blame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79e7271739f81ac95dbceb4ce743de875febab2/0_0_2952_1772/master/2952.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e066539534c562929b4a93722df26833","title":"happy to work from home for ever six ways to win over your boss","story":"We’re still delivering on the work front but without the pressures of the daily commute, little wonder so many of us want to hang on to our newly flexible livesBosses used to assume that flexible working meant their employees were watching daytime TV and sending the odd “reply all” email to look busy. Then, coronavirus arrived and working from home became vital to keeping many businesses afloat.So, how can you convince your employer to make flexible working the new normal? Here’s the evidence you need …Working from home worksA global pandemic is nobody’s idea of a perfect backdrop for a major change in working practices, but in spite of the obstacles, millions of office workers have transformed into home workers and our jobs are still getting done. Twitter’s CEO Jack Dorsey has even told his 5,000 employees they can choose to work at home forever. “We want employees to be able to work where they feel most creative and productive,” explained a spokesperson. Bhutta isn’t surprised. “OK, we didn’t choose this situation,” she says. “But flexibility is clearly available in many more jobs than had been advertised on that basis. We need employers to ask themselves, has there really been a significant drop in productivity? I think they’ll find employees have been doing their best in very challenging circumstances.”People are working smarterA huge amount of time during the office working day is wasted on interruptions and unnecessary meetings. “We all know the stress of presenteeism, of having to sit in a meeting room for an hour while someone drones on – it drains activity,” says Tracey Follows, founder of the strategy consultancy Futuremade. “Working from home allows you to take control of how and when you use your energy,” she says. This in turn can lead to increased efficiency.It makes employees happy You want to jump on a video call from the park? Download documents at the beach? Thanks to Vodafone’s unlimited data, you can. Helping employees to achieve a better work-life balance is an obvious way to support them and encourage their loyalty. “Flexible working means the employer gets an engaged, happy employee who is able to concentrate on their job while they’re working because they can also plan for the school pick-up or to visit elderly relatives,” says Bhutta. “When people have autonomy they are loyal and committed, which leads to benefits in terms of productivity.”The traditional office is outdatedOne look at the deserted skyscrapers in our cities shows that it’s time to retire any romantic attachment to Mad Men-style central offices. Especially now that screen partitions between desks, regular deep cleaning and one-way traffic systems will need to be implemented to help prevent future waves of coronavirus. Offices could well transform into occasional spaces where people meet for training days or to collaborate on projects. Even the CEO of Barclays Bank, Jes Staley, has acknowledged that “the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past”. While, sadly, this might signal the end of the office biscuit tin, it could save employers hundreds of millions pounds in annual office costs.Businesses can access more talentSaying goodbye to the traditional office means an opportunity to welcome in new staff, talent and ideas from all over the world. “Flexibility opens up the workforce to many more people,” says Follows. “It gives opportunities for talented people who live far from big cities, who are from different socioeconomic backgrounds or have disabilities. It’s an opportunity to be grasped.”Employers get to be human tooDuring this crisis, thanks to all the video meetings, we’ve got to know our colleagues and bosses as actual people who have overloaded bookshelves, home schooled kids and cute puppies in their lives. Employers have become relatable, not just an intimidating presence at board meetings. “Seeing people’s kids and dogs popping up on video calls has meant that people’s responsibilities have become visible in the world of work, in a way that they weren’t before,” says Bhutta. “It’s been a real opportunity to see people beyond their role at work. And that’s something we don’t want to turn the clock back on.”From uninterrupted video meetings to deciding when and where you work best, getting the most from your mobile data has never been more important.Keep connecting with our unlimited data plans.

And it’s a trend that’s set to continueIt doesn’t take a statistician to work out that we’ve all been online a lot in the last few months. From home schooling and streaming to ensuring your household has all the essentials (which may or may not have been purchased from Deliveroo), the number of gigabytes we’ve used and the time we’ve spent online has ticked ever upwards.But exactly how much more are we online now? What’s using up most of our data? And what will happen as lockdown ends? Turns out it does take statisticians to work all that out – which is why we’ve looked at their reports to compile this list of five facts about you, the internet and your data usage. You’re welcome.1. In lockdown, we’ve each been online for four hours and two minutes a dayYou always knew you had it in you to be a record breaker, didn’t you? You were right. According to Ofcom’s new Online Nation 2020 report, an annual survey looking at how the UK’s internet usage is changing, the four hours and two minutes we’ve averaged online during lockdown is a new high. And it’s an increase of 37 minutes a day per online adult compared with January 2020.Even without lockdown, we’ve been using the internet more than ever before. In the past year before we were locked down, we were online for 17 minutes a day more than the previous year. The biggest users? 18 to 24 year olds, who logged on for an hour more each day than adults overall.“That’s one of the more interesting stats that we found,” says Jory MacKay, RescueTime’s marketing manager. “This means that essentially each time you look at your phone you’ve got a 5050 chance of setting off a chain reaction of phone check ins.”5. Why unlimited data deals are great for familiesYou know that feeling when your work Zoom call’s audio goes so robotic and stuttery it’s like a Daft Punk remix? And on investigation, it turns out that the rest of your household is variously streaming video, online gaming and generally draining so much of your bandwidth that they might as well have attached a tap and be dispensing pints of it in the street?“As households are doing their learning, communicating, streaming – everything – online, that puts more pressure on the home internet,” says Gilani. “One answer is to have your own separate connection – whether through your phone or a dedicated mobile broadband connection – which means you can do what you need to do without interrupting what the rest of the family does. You can then get on with client calls while another family member is playing Fortnite.” In a pandemic, these are good problems to have.Staying connected has never been more vital – and it often seems that everyone in the family wants to be online at the same time.

Thousands of university students have been forced to return to their childhood bedrooms after their first taste of freedom was well and truly curtailed. Younger teens have had school unceremoniously cancelled, and others have not been able to leave the house at all due to health concerns. But the good news is, with lockdown easing, things are finally changing.Here three young people, with very different experiences of lockdown, describe what life feels like now they are recovering some of their much-yearned-for freedom …‘Our phones are what connect us’Anya, 19, BristolI always thought the phrase ‘absence makes the heart grow fonder’ was a bit of a cliche but my boyfriend and I are absolute proof that it’s true. Luke and I have been a couple longer in lockdown than out of it. We met in January and went from sleeping at each other’s houses five nights a week to not physically touching each other since 16 March.I have cystic fibrosis so I have had to shield at home with my mum we even disinfect food packets when they come into the house. But despite our physical distance, Luke, who’s 23, and I are closer than ever. These extraordinary times have meant we can really focus on getting to know each other at a deeper level. He makes me feel good and takes me away from the mundanity of every day. We’ve had the time and space to really talk about what’s important to us and best of all we make each other laugh.In early lockdown we’d FaceTime from the moment we woke up to when we went to sleep. I’d walk around the house with him in my hand Mum got totally used to him being here with us and has got to know him too. We’d even have date nights watching the same film on Netflix from our bedrooms.More recently we’ve made our first tentative steps into the outside world together, albeit still being physically apart. We have to take things slowly as I’m still shielding but I have driven over and had a barbecue with his family in his garden, even if I do take my own chair and plate and cutlery to be safe.We are taking it a day at a time but for now, I’m so relieved he is always by my side thanks to our phones.‘My friendships mean more to me than ever’ Carrie, 14, MacclesfieldFriendship has become even more important since March. I speak to my best friend Yaz most days and if I didn’t have her I don’t know what I’d do. We just get each other.I get on really well with my family but you talk to friends in a different way. I’ve used my phone more since lockdown than ever before. But when you’ve suddenly had all your freedom taken away it’s hardly surprising. I spend hours chatting on social media or FaceTime. Some days I look back and see I’ve been on my phone for eight hours.Before lockdown hit I loved my own space. I’m a keen mountain biker so I’d be out in the woods with friends or hanging out at mates’ houses, or a coffee shop.Now lockdown has eased, I’m out and about more so I use a lot of data. I go mountain biking and while there are more people on the trails we always do our best to socially distance. I like to meet friends in the park or go to a place nearby to wild swim. I always have my phone to reassure my mum I’m safe.But I miss socialising without having to think so carefully about it. I never thought I’d say it, but I can’t wait to go back to school.An unexpected bonus of this year is I’m getting on really well with my brother Dan, who’s 18. We used to bicker but now we really talk to each other. The other day he even invited me to join his friends around the firepit in the garden.‘I’m finally getting some freedom back’George, 21, Bishop SuttonThe second year of university is known as the party year, you’re in the swing of student life, there are no exams and just plenty of socialising and nights out. So I never imagined I’d be driving back to my family home at 1am on a March morning, as lockdown hit, and then spending the majority of the year back in my childhood bedroom. It has been hard to take, as up until March, I hadn’t spent more than three weeks consecutively at home since finishing my A-levels. On the plus side, I have enjoyed being close with my family again.I’m studying modern languages at the University of Oxford and suddenly my academic world has been taken completely online with seminars and tutorials. It has definitely been a challenge getting used to a new normal but I’m trying to remain positive.One benefit has been changing the way I work. When I was at uni it was like we were always working, doing snippets here and there. But now I’ve learned to work more intensely and so I get the work done faster. It means I have more free time.While I’m not seeing much of my uni friends I’m finally able to get out and catch up with local friends. We’ve met up for fish and chips near a local lake and have enjoyed river swims and socially distanced drinks at the harbourside. When the weather is good, life almost feels normal again as we sit in parks and chill together.But we can’t be spontaneous any more, we actually have to plan to meet up. In the old days we would just float around town and see who was around. I’m certainly more reliant on my phone and it’s useful having unlimited data. I’m used to crashing at a friend’s house if I’m visiting but now I have to think about getting home instead.It’s my year abroad next year and I’m lucky as I have got a job and am heading to Berlin. For those who are staying here, university is going to feel very different.When you can’t see the people you care about as much as you’d like, staying connected is more important than ever.

But after he retired to Antigua, the country of his birth, in 1995, the UK government froze his state pension entitlement. Since then, he may have missed out on more than £30,000.Monica Philip has a similar story. Now aged 81, she spent 37 years working in the UK before moving back to Antigua to nurse her ailing mother. She is having to manage on pension payouts that are little more than half what she would be getting if she had stayed in Britain.Campaigners say there are many people like Williams and Philip who accepted the invitation from the British government to emigrate from the Caribbean but, decades later, have been “effectively cheated” out of their rightful pension because they wished to spend their retirement years in their country of birth or ancestry.The issue could be put in the spotlight soon, with calls this month for a new official Windrush working group to look into the problem.The injustices suffered by the Windrush generation have been well documented but a quirk in the pensions system means that some are facing another blow. If an inidual moves back to – among others – Antigua, Trinidad, St Lucia or Grenada, their UK state pension is frozen for life.By contrast, those who move back to Jamaica or Barbados, also Commonwealth Caribbean nations, are not penalised in this way. For retirees in Jamaica and Barbados, the British state pension increases in line with inflation, as it does for those who stay in the UK or move to an EU country, the US or one of a disparate list of countries including Israel and the Philippines.Last month a cross-government working group was launched in an attempt “to address the challenges” faced by the Windrush generation and their descendants. This was two years after the then prime minister, Theresa May, promised to right the wrongs faced by those mistakenly classified as illegal immigrants by the Home Office.Earlier this month, Philip wrote to the home secretary, Priti Patel, to ask for the group to review the policy of freezing the pensions of people who move back to certain Caribbean countries.Philip is one of about 300 pensioners living in Antigua and Barbuda whose payments have been frozen. There are a further 1,300 living in Trinidad and Tobago, almost 1,000 in Grenada, more than 800 in St Lucia, and hundreds more spread across islands such as Montserrat, Anguilla, St Vincent and the Grenadines, and St Kitts and Nevis.This is not an issue that only affects some older people who retire to the Caribbean. In all, there are about 500,000 Britons living in more than 100 countries around the world who are losing out as a result of the UK’s frozen pensions policy.If you move to one of these countries from Britain, your basic state pension will be paid at the same rate as it was when you first became entitled to it, or when you left the UK if you were already a pensioner at that point.Williams, who is 85, receives a UK state pension of £78.46 a week. If he had stayed in Britain or moved to a country where payments have increased, he would be receiving a lot more: the full UK basic state pension is £134.25 a week.Born in Antigua in 1934, he relocated to the UK 21 years later and worked as a motor mechanic in Leicester. He served in the army before later working as a mechanic with the Post Office, a junior manager for BT and a driving instructor. Aged 60, he retired to Antigua and on turning 65 at the end of 1999, he started to receive his UK state pension.Williams was never unemployed and paid taxes and national insurance all his working life. He says that while he would not say he was struggling financially, “I could do with the extra cash to assist in improving my standard of living” – particularly now he is paying $2,000 East Caribbean dollars (£585) a month to support his wife, who lives in a care home.“I had no choice but to contribute to the system all of my working life, so why should I be treated differently from folks who have retired to Barbados and Jamaica?” he says.Philip was born in 1938 and emigrated to the UK in 1959. She worked there for 37 years, including a spell at the Ministry of Defence, but had to return to Antigua in 1996. Her UK state pension, to which she became entitled in 1998, was £74.11 a week and has remained at that level ever since.“This leaves me with a pension that is almost half of what I would receive if I had remained in the UK,” she says. “I do not believe I should be punished for returning to Antigua and Barbuda.”Philip adds that the policy’s unfairness and arbitrary nature are shown by the fact that her sister still lives in the UK and receives a full uprated pension.During a House of Lords debate in May, the Conservative life peer Lord Randall of Uxbridge described the frozen pensions policy as an injustice that “affects many of the Windrush generation and many others, too, throughout the world”. In the past, ministers have conceded that the rules are illogical. However, they argue it would be too expensive to uprate the pensions of those affected – estimates suggest more than £500m a year – and money should be targeted at the poorest pensioners in the UK.A government spokesperson says: “This issue of pensions is completely unrelated to issues experienced by the Windrush generation. The government continues to uprate state pensions overseas where there is a legal requirement to do so – for example, in countries where there is a reciprocal agreement that allows for uprating.”The spokesperson added: “We are determined to right the wrongs of the Windrush generation, which is why the home secretary is driving change to implement the findings of the Lessons Learned review to ensure nothing like this will happen again.”Find out more about the campaign at endfrozenpensions.orgThe UK’s frozen pensions policy dates back to just after the second world war and has been a source of complaints for decades.The general position is that the state pension is payable overseas but, where someone is not “ordinarily resident” in the UK, there is no entitlement to an annual increase. Their pension is frozen at the rate on the date they left the UK or when they became entitled to it if they were living abroad at the time.However, increases are payable to pensioners living in countries with which the UK government has a “reciprocal social security agreement” that provides for them, as well as those living in the European Economic Area (EEA), plus Switzerland and Gibraltar.The current list on the Department for Work and Pensions website includes Barbados, Bermuda, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Israel, Jamaica, Kosovo, Mauritius, Montenegro, North Macedonia, the Philippines, Serbia, Turkey and the US.Confusingly, although the UK has social security agreements with Canada and New Zealand, you cannot get a yearly increase in your UK state pension if you live in either of those countries.If a country does not appear in any of those categories, the UK state pension is not annually uprated there. Criticism of the policy began to build during the early 1960s and over the years there have been legal challenges and campaigns but nothing has managed to overturn the status quo.The government has said that post Brexit it will continue to annually increase UK state pensions for Britons living in the EEA or Switzerland by 31 December 2020 for “as long as they continue living there”.However, the picture is a lot less clear for those who move to an EEA country or Switzerland from 1 January 2021 onwards, as this is part of the current negotiations with the EU.If you move to a country where the UK state pension does not increase, you may find you are entitled to a pension or other benefits under its own system. But the rules can be fiendishly complicated and there will often be restrictions on what you can get.For example, in Australia there is the Age Pension for those aged 66-plus but this is means-tested and British migrants are not eligible until they have been an Australian resident for at least 10 years. The maximum basic rate for a single person is A$860.60 (£478) a fortnight but the income and assets tests carried out may well greatly reduce what you receive.In Canada the Old Age Security (OAS) pension is a monthly payment available to those aged 65-plus who meet the country’s legal status and residence requirements. To get it, you need to have lived in Canada for at least 10 years since the age of 18. What you receive will depend on how long you have lived there after the age of 18. For example, if you have lived there for 40 years or more, you will qualify for the full OAS pension."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3340c49e4cadf1f20b13a3d40c38e64aac64911/0_372_5586_3352/master/5586.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=6cca0d393d76575def63add98ed707c0","title":"english music venues to receive emergency pandemic aid covid 19","story":"First cash made available from UK government’s £1.57bn emergency arts fund announced on 5 July to combat effects of Covid-19 lockdownCulture secretary Oliver Dowden has announced plans to save around 150 grassroots music venues from insolvency while cashflow is limited for venues shuttered during the coronavirus pandemic.Dowden released £2.25m for the sector from the overall £1.57bn fund announced on 5 July to shore up the arts in the UK.“Without our grassroots music venues, we wouldn’t have the Beatles, Adele or Elton John,” he said. “Nearly all our globally successful music stars started out at UK clubs and live music venues – and we must make sure those organisations weather the Covid storm.” He said he was “working to deliver the rest of the £1.57bn emergency package as quickly as possible”.At-risk venues will receive grants of up to £80,000 each to fund running costs. The funds will be disbursed via Arts Council England, and are only available to English venues Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are managing their own emergency funding initiatives, totalling £188m across the arts.The news was welcomed by the Music Venue Trust (MVT), the industry organisation that represents more than 800 independent venues around the UK. MVT’s Beverly Whitrick said the organisation “warmly welcomes this essential funding for desperate grassroots music venues facing urgent, short-term challenges. Without this help, the sector would be facing a wave of permanent closures.” MVT chief executive Mark Davyd also welcomed the funding, but added: “We urgently need information and guidance on when and how venues can access the larger fund, which is so vital to safeguarding their longer term futures.”A government announcement said it expected venues to receive funds “within the next few weeks. Further details on how organisations can apply to the £1.57bn package will be released in the coming days.”Singer-songwriter James Bay said the funding would “make a real difference, ensuring we do not lose these spaces – it’s so galvanising and uplifting to know more help is on its way”. Grime rapper Novelist said it would “maintain the lifeblood of these types of venues … it’s so important to preserve the heritage for future generations … In addition, for people who live in the more remote areas of the country, small venues are literally a treasure.”The government funding comes as some venues prepare to reopen on 1 August. Further easing of lockdown restrictions means that concert venues can reopen along with other leisure facilities such as casinos and bowling alleys, though nightclubs must remain closed.Earlier this week, two Manchester venues, Gorilla and the Deaf Institute, were saved from closure after buyers were found. The previous owners had announced their closure “against the backdrop of Covid-19 and the enforced closure of all of our sites”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ed628964e0e4a6192b5e58ea2f37cf733000192/0_202_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3de1a7a4bdfffaef56f3e3e52da1483","title":"the shocking truth of racism in british schools","story":"When a teenage activist sent a callout on social media for examples of racism within schools, he was deluged with responses.

Barnier claimed the UK was effectively excluding European fleets from key stocks of fish in a move that risked destroying the bloc’s fishing industry.After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation. It was a union that got off to a tricky start and continued to be marked by the UK’s sometimes conflicted relationship with its neighbours.The French president, Charles de Gaulle, vetoes Britain’s entry to EEC, accusing the UK of a “deep-seated hostility” towards the European project.With Sir Edward Heath having signed the accession treaty the previous year, the UK enters the EEC in an official ceremony complete with a torch-lit rally, dickie-bowed officials and a procession of political leaders, including former prime ministers Harold Macmillan and Alec Douglas-Home.Margaret Thatcher negotiated what became known as the UK rebate with other EU members after the iron lady marched into the former French royal palace at Fontainebleau to demand “our own money back” claiming for every £2 contributed we get only £1 back” despite being one of the “three poorer” members of the community.It was a move that sowed the seeds of Tory Euroscepticism that was to later cause the Brexit schism in the party.\u0026nbspCollapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.Divisions between the UK and the EU deepened with Thatcher telling the Commons in an infamous speech it was ‘no, no, no’ to what she saw as Delors’ continued power grab. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun newspaper ratchets up its opposition to Europe with a two-fingered “Up yours Delors” front page.A collapse in the pound forced prime minister John Major and the then chancellor Norman Lamont to pull the UK out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.On 1 January, customs checks and duties were removed across the bloc. Thatcher hailed the vision of “a single market without barriers – visible or invisible – giving you direct and unhindered access to the purchasing power of over 300 million of the world’s wealthiest and most prosperous people.Tory rebels vote against the treaty that paved the way for the creation of the European Union.

Downing Street has so far appeared reluctant to respond to Barnier’s pressure, insisting its rulebook is wholly independent from the EU now the country has left the bloc.EU sources said there was concern in Brussels that interest in striking a deal was waning in London but that an agreement in September remained the most likely outcome given the economic damage of failure."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14526e781379417fab324a898717dcaa2e95c056/0_9_5716_3431/master/5716.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=20893bf9417cc2d3ddffbc9f39f1a92f","title":"public sector workers in england share your thoughts about the new pay rise","story":"We’d like to hear from teachers, doctors and other public sector workers about their thoughts on the pay increaseAlmost 900,000 doctors, police, teachers and other public sector workers in England will receive above-inflation pay rises to reflect the “vital contribution” they make.Labour and trade unions welcomed the move, announced by the Treasury, but warned that the increases would not make up for lost incomes under the previous public sector pay freeze.

Especially the pain.“In the back of our minds we knew that in order to come home with at least something, we were probably going to have to demolish 10 years of hard, unremitting slog in each other’s lives,” Coe says, smiling, as his mind races back to a time of high intrigue, political boycotts and – of course – those two thunderous encounters over 800m and 1500m with his arch-rival Steve Ovett. “I wouldn’t have missed it for the world.”In truth there wasn’t much else for the country to be cheery about during the dank, drizzly summer of 1980. England’s football team had come home early from the European Championship. The cricket team were losing against West Indies, again. Unemployment was at a 44-year high of 1.9 million. But in Coe and Ovett, Britain undoubtedly had the two greatest middle-distance runners in the world. And after years of avoiding each other they were suddenly squaring off twice over six days. The stakes, as they both knew, couldn’t have been much higher.Long before Brexit, Coe and Ovett split the nation down the middle. You were either for one or the other: there was no middle ground, no compromise, no safe space. The 24-year-old Ovett, the son of a market trader, was seen as blue-collar and aloof, while the 23-year-old Coe, more middle-class and media-friendly. Both were hugely popular, though. Ovett had won the BBC’s Sport Personality of the Year award in 1978. Coe, having broken three world records in 41 days after graduating in 1979, snatched it off him a year later.In fact just about the only thing that everyone agreed on was that Coe, as the reigning world record holder, was the piping hot favourite over 800m – while Ovett, who had not lost over 1500m since 1977, was the man to beat over the longer distance. Only it didn’t turn out that way. Far from it.Coe had been imperious on the track over the previous two summers, but he was about to learn that chasing times was very different to hunting after Olympic gold medals. During the first lap of the 800m final he was repeatedly bumped and blocked, strong-armed and shunted back, an assault that began on the first bend when the East German Andreas Busse deliberately kept him out wide. With the race more like a game of dodgems, Coe was unable to rev up towards his top-end speed until Ovett had flown clear to take gold.However Coe was also the author of his own misfortune, repeatedly running down blind alleys and thus rendering impotent his talent. As Hugh McIlvanney sagely put it in the Observer: “Coe looked like a man who had been stabbed in the back, and then found that the knife was in his own hand.”Coe was so disgusted that when Ovett offered him his outstretched palm on the rostrum he reacted, in Clive James’s immortal words, “as if he’d just been handed a turd”. His father, coach and mentor, Peter was even blunter. At the post-race press conference he used the rudest four-letter word to describe his son’s run.“I think I lost that race before I stepped on the track,” says Coe. “It was just a suffusion of inexperience and just not controlling my own head in the 24 hours leading up to the race. I found myself in very alien territory. Normally the world can be crashing around my feet, as occasionally it does, and I still sleep. That was the first and only time that I’ve ever had a problem. Then at breakfast I was putting milk on my cornflakes when I dropped the jug. I felt very out of sync. Championships racing is just so totally different.”Coe now believes the East Germans deliberately used team tactics to try to stop him and Ovett. “But I don’t think in their team talk beforehand they figured out that Steve was going to muscle his way through,” he says with a laugh. “And good luck to him, he did. He wasn’t intimidated.”The following morning Coe was buried in bed, not wanting to lift his head from his sheets when the Olympic decathlon champion Daley Thompson marched into his room. “‘Come on, you’re getting up,’” Coe recalls him saying. “I said something lame like: ‘What’s the weather like out there?’ And as he ripped open the curtains he said: ‘It all looks a bit silver to me.’ It was the Daley school of psychotherapy.”Two things kept Coe going: the knowledge that he couldn’t surely run as badly again – and the fear that if he did, people would question his character. He also had help from unusual directions. Two days after what he considered his humiliation in the 800m, he was brooding in the Olympic village when his father brought in a telegram from England. It was signed by a Mrs Mullory, and said simply: “Get your bloody finger out, Coe, I’ve got money on you.” The Coes never found out who she was but they decided she was right.Meanwhile the Observer’s athletics correspondent Chris Brasher, a 3,000m steeplechase gold medallist at the 1956 Games, and the Australian Ron Clarke, who took 10,000m bronze at the 1964 Games, decided it would be good for the sport if Coe won the 1500m. So, they sent him a letter outlining the tactics that could help him to win gold. “Relax on the pace, move into position and strike – remembering that he who strikes first is generally the victor,” they told him. “The only person that can beat you is yourself.”It meant that when the bell tolled for Coe in the 1500m final he was ready. Having steadily wound up the pace after a dawdling first couple of laps, he struck for home as he entered the straight. Ovett, whose electric acceleration had been dulled by the sustained pressure of Coe’s speed, searched for fifth gear but found only third and had to settle for bronze behind the East German Jürgen Straub.Coe’s face – two parts exhilaration, one part sweet relief – made the front pages of papers across the globe, while Ovett was left shaking his head. But in hindsight, Coe wonders whether his old rival had subconsciously switched off after winning gold in the 800m.“In the call room before the 1500m I remember Steve saying: ‘Can you imagine what this would be worth in Atlantic City?’ and also telling me: ‘When this is all over it would be nice to sit down and have a drink.’ It wasn’t that I was particularly not up for that. I just couldn’t believe that anybody was at that moment talking to me. I just grunted and went back into my own little zone.”Afterwards Coe did not hit the bright lights of Moscow, preferring instead to have a quiet couple of drinks with teammates. “We had a guy called Boris who sat with us in the relaxation area,” says Coe. “He’d got a paperback covered in brown wrapping which he was reading while obviously listening to our conversations. I remember Brendan Foster asking him where the nearest nightclub was. He didn’t even take his eyes off the book. He just said: ‘Helsinki.’”Of course history could have turned out very differently if Britain had expected to join the Americans, Canadians and West Germans in boycotting the Games in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Coe, then a rising star in the Conservative party, was one of the more prominent voices calling for Britain to go to Moscow – something not everyone was happy about.“I actually ended up with a swastika being painted on the front door of the garage of my house in the middle of that debate,” says Coe, who has been the president of World Athletics since 2015. “But at the same time that we were being told that we shouldn’t go to the Games, pipe deals were being signed with BP and Russia, the Bolshoi ballet had arrived in London, and it just seemed a rather disproportionate response to target sport.”Incidentally, a few years ago Coe and Ovett, who sadly only raced seven times in 17 years, met over dinner and found they had a lot more in common than they had thought back in their heydays. Yet, inevitably, the same one-upmanship they had felt while chasing each other’s world records had not completely gone away.“We were chatting about the buildup to Moscow and in a rare moment of candour I told him that on a wintry Christmas Day of 1979 I’d done a run from the Peak District, 13 miles uphill into Sheffield,” says Coe. “I got back, had my Christmas lunch, sat down to watch the 800th screening of The Dam Busters and I remember feeling vaguely uneasy. I knew suddenly what it was. I sat there thinking: ‘I bet he’s out training again.’ So compulsively, I went upstairs, put my kit on, ran another five miles.”There is a Pinteresque pause. “When I told Steve that story he laughed,” adds Coe, with a twinkle in his eye. “And then he said: ‘Did you only go out twice that day?’ That was years afterwards, yet we were both still in the mindset where we couldn’t let it just rest.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dba236ecb48fda1b3e71fe5cb6a4b5808c055b47/612_126_4313_2588/master/4313.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=a1d1e78c2568cb4e5663224bfbfebc26","title":"sliding home baseball in colour in pictures","story":"As the 2020 season finally gets under way, we take a look back in time, courtesy of the work of artist Mark Truelove and his fantastic colorised vintage baseball photographs"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4ad2c360d4c3c1f9bb5024eca3a2d0e09d1fec6/75_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=458230545ccad223097f1f4907ae5fdc","title":"tiny dancers review national youth theatre isley lynn","story":"Available online Collaborating remotely during lockdown, National Youth Theatre players deliver an intriguing mix of sketches by Isley Lynn with restless verveIt’ll come as no surprise that Tiny Dancers, a collection of sketches devised during lockdown, is all about the struggle to connect.

We watch two lovers share a dinner (and disastrous fight) over the internet a young woman talks to a long dead relative somehow contained in cyberspace, and an astronaut tries to make contact from out of space. This vibrant mix never merges into a satisfying whole but there’s an intensity of emotion in here, and a powerful desire simply to be heard, that’s undeniably potent.There’s a general air of restlessness and entrapment to many of the sketches but, while lockdown is mentioned explicitly a few times, the time zone of Tiny Dancers is all over the place. A few of the sketches have a futuristic sci-fi feel to them and are the least successful of the lot, often hinging on an element of surprise that winds up feeling laboured.The seemingly simple sketches are the most complex and powerful of the bunch.

It was the outside life, the beaches, the mountains, the cicada chirps and the cheese pies that were calling. So I was determined to be on the first flight back with my daughter, who was born in Kalamata and, as luck would have it, could celebrate her 14th birthday in the area.The first challenge, of course, was getting there. Unless you are the prime minister’s father, this had to wait until 15 July, when Greece started accepting direct flights from the UK. We flew in the next day on the first charter flight – to the island of Lemnos – and then made our way to the Peloponnese via Athens. Direct flights to Kalamata start on 25 July.The scene at Gatwick airport was pretty calm: the plane was about two-thirds full, allowing for a bit of distancing (we had three seats between two). At the Greek end, however, it felt celebratory, with airport staff very pleased to see us. Then came the serious business. Visitors have to fill in an online form before travelling, and on-arrival testing is decided on your responses. About half of us had to undergo a procedure that is a little unpleasant, involving a throat swab. Anyone testing positive would have been informed within 24 hours, and then have to isolate for 14 days at a hotel paid for by the Greek government. Greece is, understandably, keeping a close eye on all this as so far it has recorded a very low infection rate.Normally, the tour representative would have been meeting 40 people a week off flights, but on this first flight it was less than 10. Even so, she could not have been happier to see us, and had to resist physically greet us.We were the first UK visitors for a while to stay in our overnight hotel, the Herodion in Athens, and the staff and Greek customers on the roof terrace overlooking the Parthenon that night were equally enthusiastic in welcoming us. Normally during high season, a place like this, with the old marbles floodlit beside us, would be fully booked. The next day we drove south into the Peloponnese. Fourteen years ago, when my daughter was born, this would have been a four-and-a-half-hour trip, but new toll roads have reduced it to three. Admittedly, it’s not quite as breathtaking a journey , but it’s still a spectacular drive through the mountains, past some of the best historical sites in Greece – Corinth (we stopped at the canal as it has the best roadside souvlaki joint going), the old ruins of Mycenae, the stadium at Nemea and Sparta all flashed by between the cypress trees and the olive groves.We were heading for an isolated villa, Kalamaki Katerina, near Petalidi, on the western prong of the Peloponnese. This would have been an excellent place to spend lockdown, sitting half a kilometre up a dirt track, with a pool overlooking the mountains of the Mani opposite. In fact, it’s one of the things that makes this area so special: even in busy times, this corner attracts “discerning” tourists, both Greek and foreign, who know rural Greece well. There’s nothing complicated about this, as always it’s about location and a bit of care with the details. Our villa was simple, but well cared for, and the views were drinkable.It also came with a complimentary meal at a local taverna. Anywhere else this would probably have been a nondescript place by the beach here it was in a tourist-free mountain village. We almost drove past it as we were looking at the church over the road, but the taverna itself was an old stone building with about five tables on its plane tree-covered terrace. There were no menus and when we were ready for lunch, we were ushered into the kitchen to see what was cooking and make our choice. Soutzoukakia (meatballs in sauce), slow-cooked beef (which came apart with a spoon) and gigantes beans are fairly normal Greek fare. Here it was simple but superb.Kardamyli, on the coast of the middle Peloponnese finger opposite us, is a bit more sophisticated, and we headed there after a couple of days. We also used to live here, so the drive over brought back many memories. The village has a certain cachet with writers and artists. It’s not hard to see why. Despite development over the past 20 years, the buildings are all traditionally beautiful, and behind it the Taygetos mountains tower above the sea. There are a few more trendy shops than 10 years ago (olives and wine), but the thin main road still cuts straight through the village, leading to hilarious mini traffic jams, and the manavi vans, piled with fruit veg, still weave through announcing their wares via a loudspeaker.Denia, an old friend, is fiercely proud of her family business, Trigilidas Travel, founded back in 1974 in Kalamata. She had reopened the Kardamyli office a couple of weeks ago, but said that in a normal season it would have been open from May. For July, the village is notably quiet, but there were a few European tourists here, and there is a palpable sense of relief among the locals who rely on their business for survival. My daughter bought a beach wrap from a little shop on the high street. The old guy behind the counter stared at it for a moment and then announced: “You are my first sale, on the first day of my new season.”Though British tourists were thin on the ground, we met a family by the village swimming jetty who had booked a private rental a while back, but then had their flights cancelled. Rather than give up, they managed a workaround, flying via Amsterdam and then driving from Athens, like us. They were delighted to be in the village and, I felt, rather proud to be pioneering “Greece returners”.My daughter’s birthday was spent in two venues in the village, both of which have had to introduce new measures due to the virus. Cake was at Androuvista, or Anna’s as locals know it, where the eponymous owner and her brother wear masks, have set up a sanitation station and disinfect religiously. The Happy Beads shop up the road is run by an English couple who have been here for 16 years. They confided that lockdown, enforced much more strictly here than in the UK, had been scary, but they were slowly getting used to being open again and were hopeful about the rest of the season. The saddest loss for Kardamyli had been the cancellation of the International Jazz Festival, normally held in May.Later that day, we headed south to the sandy beaches of Stoupa. Busier than Kardamyli, and with a few more foreigners around, it was still quiet for the time of year. We stopped in to see friends who run Dive Code in Kalogria – this is definitively the beach that the real Zorba danced on, despite the novel and film being set in Crete. They said trade was picking up slowly and they were about to take out a party of Dutch tourists.The landscape of the Exo (outer) Mani cries out for exploration, and hiking is a great way to do it. Kardamyli is the base for an excellent tour firm called 2407, a reference to the height in metres of the Peloponnese’s tallest peak, easily seen from the village. They offer advice and a range of excursions but July is too hot for hiking, at least for this old man, so we drove up into the mountains as far Kastania, only 560 metres above the beaches but a world away.This remarkable little village has at least nine churches, the oldest 1,000 years old, with 13th-century frescoes that have been recently restored. Much more modern, although you wouldn’t guess it, is the 19th-century Dourakis tower house – a mini castle built to defend the local clan. It has also been restored, and after 20 odd years I was finally able to explore its surprising number of levels. We ate in the simple taverna next door, accompanied by a couple of old Greek guys and served by the cook’s grandson.Greek food is often uncomplicated, but that doesn’t mean it can’t be spectacular. Above all, seafood is worth trying in Kardamyli, and there are plenty of options. Hotanineas taverna was a new discovery for me, but I knew the spot, right by a mini swimming platform with sunsets like a dream. Kardamyli does have a glorious pebble beach to the north, but swimming in town off the concrete quays is a joy, especially after dreaming of being here so often during lockdown. At the taverna, the key is to ignore menus and look at what’s in the fridge. We chose a fagri (red porgy, I believe) grilled whole with oil and lemon, plus octopus, taramosalata (not the bright pink variety you might be thinking about) and marouli (just lettuce and olives in oil). The taverna wasn’t packed, staff wore masks, but it was the Greece I had been missing. We went back the next night.• Accommodation was provided by Sunvil, which has villas with a pool in the Peloponnese from about £950 a week self-catering.

The move fuelled critics’ suspicions that the president was stressing a “law and order” campaign theme at the expense of civil liberties.Wyden said in a written statement on Thursday: “The violent tactics deployed by Donald Trump and his paramilitary forces against peaceful protesters are those of a fascist regime, not a democratic nation.”Speaking by phone, he said: “Unless America draws a line in the sand right now, I think we could be staring down the barrel of martial law in the middle of a presidential election.”Military control of government was last imposed in the US in 1941, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that triggered entry into the second world war. In current circumstances it would entail “trashing the constitution and trashing people’s inidual rights”, Wyden warned.The Oregon senator recalled a recent conversation with a legal adviser for the head of national intelligence.“I asked him again and again what was the constitutional justification for what the Trump administration is doing in my home town and he completely ducked the questions and several times said, ‘Well, I just want to extend my best wishes to your constituents.’“After I heard him say it several times, I said my constituents don’t want your best wishes. They want to know when you’re going to stop trashing their constitutional rights.”The White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, began a briefing on Friday with a selectively edited video montage depicting protests, flames, graffiti and chaos in Portland.“The Trump administration will not stand by and allow anarchy in our streets,” she said. “Law and order will prevail.”Trump has falsely accused his election rival, Joe Biden, of pledging to “defund the police” so violent crime will flourish. Democrats condemn Trump for a made-for-TV attempt to distract both from Black Lives Matter protests and his mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic, now killing more than 1,000 Americans a day.“I wish the president would fight the coronavirus half as hard as he attacks my home town,” Wyden said. “I think he’s setting up an us-against-them kind of strategy. He’s trying to create his narrative that my constituents, who are peaceful protesters, are basically anarchists, sympathisers of anarchists and, as he does so often, just fabricate it.The Portland deployment, known as Operation Diligent Valor, involves 114 officers from homeland security and the US Marshals Service, according to court documents. Local officials say their heavy-handed approach, including teargas and flash grenades, has merely enflamed demonstrations against police brutality and racial injustice. The justice department-led Operation Legend involves more than 200 agents each in Kansas City and Chicago as well as 35 in Albuquerque. It is targeted at violent crime.Lori Lightfoot, the mayor of Chicago, has vowed to resist the federal intervention.“We’re not going to allow the unconstitutional, state-sanctioned lawlessness we saw brought to Portland here in Chicago,” she said on Thursday.Merkley offered warning words of advice based on Oregon’s current experience.“I would say that you probably don’t believe that these federal forces will attack protesters if the protesters are peaceful and you will be wrong because that’s exactly what they’re doing in Portland,” he told the .“This is an all-out assault in military-style fashion on a peaceful-style protest. The way to handle graffiti is put up a fence or come out and ask people to stop doing it, not to attack a peaceful protest but that’s exactly what happened. It’s very clear what the president is trying to do is incite violence and then display that violence in campaign ads. And I say this because that’s exactly what he’s doing right now. This is not some theory.”The senator added: “This is just an absolute assault on people’s civil rights to speak and to assemble.”Merkley argued that with past targets such as Islamic State and undocumented migrants losing their potency, Trump has settled on African American communities in inner cities to be his latest scapegoats.“I think it’s also important to note the president we’ve always known has this intense authoritarian streak,” he said. “He loved and had so much affection for the leader of North Korea, Putin in Russia. Just admiration for some of the tactics in the Philippines with Duterte and Erdoğan in Turkey, by the crown prince in Saudi Arabia.”On Friday the United Nations warned against the use of excessive force against demonstrators and media in the US.“Peaceful demonstrations that have been taking place in cities in the US, such as Portland, really must be able to continue,” the UN human rights office spokeswoman, Elizabeth Throssell, told reporters in Geneva."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7797ba4ab4ce5e8d625333b291531ecfff5c86a6/200_276_3982_2390/master/3982.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a32a02bea709b5641d8b81b9c116db8","title":"shielding in england how do you feel about going back to work","story":"We’d like to hear from people who have been shielding about their thoughts on returning to workFrom 1 August, those who have been shielding in England will be able to leave their homes to exercise, buy food and visit places of worship for the first time since March.They will also be able to return to work, rather than continue to work from home, as long as their place of employment is ‘Covid-secure’.If you have been shielding during the lockdown and are returning to work from August, we’d like to hear from you.How do you feel about retuning to your workplace after shielding for four months?

It was the greatest dream of our youth,” Erdoğan said before the reopening. “It was the yearning of our people and it has been accomplished.”Outside, in Sultanahmet Square, about 350,000 people joined the president in worship. Many had arrived on buses from all over the country the night before, camping on the square overnight. Hundreds of excited people pushed past police crowd control lines on Friday morning, eager to be a part of the historic occasion.“I’m very very happy,” said Abdulazim Gassama, a theology student from Mali living in Turkey. “African Muslims know about the Hagia Sophia, Constantinople and Byzantium. This is important for Islam.”In neighbouring Greece, scenes of an opposite nature unfolded: bells tolled and flags flew at half-mast at hundreds of churches across the country in protest at the move, and Orthodox church leaders held vigils describing Friday as a “day of mourning”.The Unesco-listed Hagia Sophia (Divine Wisdom), known in Turkish as Ayasofya, was completed in AD537 by the Byzantine emperor Justinian. After the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in AD1453 Sultan Mehmet II converted it into an imperial mosque, adding four minarets around the building’s grand central dome.Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the secular founder of the Turkish Republic, turned the Hagia Sophia into a museum in 1934 in a symbolic break with the past, but Turkish Islamists and nationalists have campaigned for decades to restore its Muslim heritage.A Turkish court paved the way for the Hagia Sophia’s newest chapter after it ruled unanimously this month to annul Atatürk’s decision. Erdoğan. who has championed Islamic values during his 17 years in office, signed a presidential order turning the site back into a mosque almost immediately.The move appears to be designed to please his ruling Justice and Development party’s conservative voter base as the government struggles to shore up popular support amid a burgeoning economic crisis.Leading opposition figures have for the most part refused to engage in Turkey’s latest polarising political issue, either ignoring the Hagia Sophia decision or offering muted support.Internationally, however, the monument’s rebirth as a mosque has been greeted with dismay, drawing criticism from the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, Pope Francis and several Orthodox church leaders around the world.The Hagia Sophia has also further strained relations between Ankara and Athens, which are at a low ebb over migrant flows and oil and gas drilling rights in the Mediterranean.“Today is a difficult day ... a shadow hangs over us with the transformation of Hagia Sophia into a mosque, something that genuinely shocks Christians all over the world and not only Greeks,” the Greek government spokesperson, Stelios Petsas, said in an interview with private channel Open TV.“We have warned for some time that this will create an unbridgeable gap between Turkey and the Christian world.”Erdoğan has brushed off the international criticism, claiming the Hagia Sophia’s future is an issue of national sovereignty – a favourite topic for the populist president.Osman Tarhan, a mechanic, was among the crowds singing and waving Turkish flags outside the 1,500-year-old building on Friday.“I see the condemnation from the Christian world as meaningless. Muslims prayed inside for five centuries, and there are a lot of churches converted from mosques in Spain. These things happen,” the 45-year-old said.“The story of the Hagia Sophia mosque didn’t end in the 1930s. That was only a break, and now it is a mosque again.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0948a9770d92e4c44dca2cf2adeb3eaf00c755c/0_69_2065_1239/master/2065.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=7f5fc76209a808d61f830a925e9df198","title":"all the people what happens if humanitys ranks start to shrink","story":"A study in the Lancet suggests the world’s population will peak in 2064. If so, the consequences will be profoundThe battle to feed humanity has been lost, Paul Ehrlich warned in his influential 1968 treatise, The Population Bomb. The world’s population was growing faster than the Earth could sustain, he predicted, and catastrophe loomed. “In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now.”That doomsday message turned the entomologist into a celebrity and galvanised population control and environmental movements for years after. But another social wave gathering at the time would help prove his forecasts wildly wrong.A key driver are the feminist movements that were gathering steam as The Population Bomb was hitting bookshops. Their victories included new space for people to pursue careers, delay or eschew marriage, and have fewer children or none at all. Given such opportunities, women take them up in numbers so vast that the trajectory of our species is altered, says Christopher Murray, the director of the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, and the lead author of the Lancet study.“We’ve realised there’s something different about our species, namely that women can control their fertility,” he says. “And as they get more educated and have access to jobs and careers they choose to have fewer children than replacement requires.”As educational opportunities for women have grown and contraceptives have improved in quality and become more easily available, the same trend has been observed from the suburbs of America to the cities of Iran and villages of India. “I have always believed education is the best contraceptive pill,” says Poonam Muttreja, the executive director of the Delhi-based Population Foundation of India. “It is the magic contraceptive pill for fertility rates going down.”It will be a significantly older world, the study says, the implications of which would touch everything from economic productivity, to the kind of culture produced, to the way buildings are designed and beyond. Working-age populations will have declined by several hundred million in India and China. Australia, Canada and the US would keep the size of their workforces steady only by keeping anti-migrant politics in check. Many of those new arrivals would come from Sub-Saharan Africa, whose population will have tripled in size.Far from a future of governments scrambling to feed their populations, as some feared, such projections are driving many to find ways to persuade their citizens to procreate. Hungary’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, promised last year that women who had four or more children would never pay income tax again. Iran’s state hospitals and clinics are no longer performing vasectomies or handing out contraceptives.Stubbornly low birthrates may not just be a matter of empowered people exercising choice. Surveys in Europe and other highly developed economies show women generally want larger families than they end up having. Feminist activism gave people greater opportunity to work and have fewer children if they wished. The erosion of the welfare state and stagnating middle-class wages in many countries, however, have closed off the choice to spend more time at home and raise a large family. The expected deep recessions caused by the coronavirus lockdown may lead to even fewer children born in the years ahead.Sweden is one of the few countries that found a formula to give its birthrate a jolt, says Murray, using a package of policies including childcare, flexible working conditions and generous maternity and paternity leave packages. But the increase to the fertility rate was marginal – just 0.2 children per woman, he says – and the same policy suite failed to nudge birthrates upwards when applied in countries such as Singapore, Japan and Taiwan. UN research says affordable, widespread and high-quality childcare programmes definitely make a difference, but the benefits of other pro-family policies such as cash payments or subsidised access to IVF appear to be less emphatic.In India, whose population could peak at 1.6 billion in less than two decades according to the University of Washington study, slowing birthrates are enthusiastically welcomed. Muttreja sees the human benefits behind the statistics.“If you look at the body language of young people in the villages, and especially girls who have gone to school, they look more confident when you talk to them they have more determination, and many of them are convincing their families not to get them married early, to allow them to study,” Muttreja says.Too much Indian birth control happens through sterilisation or unsafe abortions, she says, and the termination of female foetuses is still a scourge. But people are also absorbing messages to use contraception, space out pregnancies and delay marriage until adulthood.“There are still young girls who have no control over their lives: they get married early, go through violence,” she adds. “But I am looking at girls who are stepping out. And also young boys who relate more to the values of their peers and not necessarily the family values of tradition and patriarchy.”If the predictions come to pass, the reality of an older, shrinking population is likely to exert a heavier weight on public debates about forces such as capitalism and racism in the decades ahead – or at least it should, Murray says. “It really has a profound effect and people haven’t been thinking about it for a long time.”“Having a society where the population pyramid is inverted, where there’s fewer people in the age group behind you and more people in the age group ahead of you – which is where we’re rapidly heading – just has incredibly profound effects on every aspect of how our society is organised,” he says.“Who pays taxes? How do we afford health insurance and social security? Who’s respected in society? When there’s tons of people over 80 and very few under 30, everything gets totally scrambled and I think nobody’s really coming to grips just how different societies will be within an inverted age structure.”As well as relieving the strain on the environment, “peak human” might force a reckoning with economic models that link prosperity to endless growth, says Derek Hoff, an associate professor of University of Utah’s David Eccles School of Business, who has written a book on the US population debate.“The argument is that if you don’t have steadily rising populations you can’t have economic growth, and there there is this crisis for social support systems of too many old people and not enough young people to pay for them,” he says.That growth orthodoxy is coming under increasing scrutiny, especially in developed economies. Hoff does not deny that ageing population throws up challenges, “but I don’t think it’s as big a crisis as is being suggested”, he says. “Look at Japan. Everyone say it’s in a demographic downward spiral. But it’s a very rich society and continues to get richer.”As that debate takes place, the pushback against falling birthrates is likely to intensify. And if people cannot be persuaded to have more children, Murray says some governments might turn to more punitive methods.“When societies really start to have geopolitical issues, what’s going to happen?” he says. “I think we will see a lot of energy going into trying to solve this problem. Some of that will be constructive – giving women more support to have careers and children. Some may be a real threat to women’s right to choose.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b06397908a85f8cd9b32f70f99fcc70f6217b935/780_1267_4489_2694/master/4489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f9cc7695efcca1d5a54bbe3766560b1","title":"coronavirus live news close watch on victoria australia and record infections globally","story":"WHO reports 284,196 new cases Vietnam reports first case in three months US records fourth day of 1,000-plus deaths“We had a full entertainment team, and the schedule all worked out for this beautiful journey ...

The UK government has urged the public to help speed up the search for a coronavirus vaccine by signing up to participate in clinical studies.The business secretary, Alok Sharma, appealed for more volunteers to put themselves forward for vaccine trials in a column for the Daily Mail on Saturday. “We are asking people to register to participate in important clinical studies, helping to speed up the search for a vaccine and to end the pandemic sooner,” he wrote.“As a government, we are backing every horse in the race to ensure the British public can be vaccinated against this disease as soon as possible.”Earlier this week, initial trials of a vaccine under development by Oxford University appeared to show their inoculation is safe and triggers an immune response. The result is very promising, but it is still too early to say whether it offers enough protection against the virus. Sharma said: “Over the past few months, we have been cautiously and gradually reopening our economy, and it is fantastic to see so many shops, pubs, hairdressers, and other businesses taking necessary steps to keep customers and workers safe.“But we all know that the best way to defeat this disease once and for all, and really get our economy firing on all cylinders again so we can protect and create jobs, is by finding a safe and effective vaccine.”He added: “Volunteers can play their part by signing up at nhs.ukresearchcontact.“Every member of the public has a supporting role to play as we await that momentous breakthrough.”The ancient theatre of Epidaurus, renowned for its acoustics, has reopened for a limited number of open-air performances, and organisers planning a live-streamed event on Saturday for the first time in the Greek monument’s 2,300-year history.Live concerts and events have been mostly cancelled in Greece this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic.

The 68-year-old said on Saturday that he may no longer be able to handover to a successor by the time he turns 70, as he had hoped. “I had expressed a hope that I would be able to hand over by the time I celebrate my 70th birthday but I do not determine the path of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Lee, son of Singapore’s modern day founder, Lee Kuan Yew.“A lot will depend on how events unfold and all I can say is I will see this through and I will hand over in good shape as soon as possible to the next team.”Lee’s People’s Action party has ruled Singapore since independence in 1965.More details are emerging on the recent spike in coronavirus cases in South Korea reported earlier today.

Please feel free to DM me your updates on Twitter @AaronWala. This morning, England’s gyms and indoor pools are reopening for the first time in four months in the latest easing of lockdown measures. But at least a third of public facilities are expected to remain shut due to financial hardship.Earlier this month, the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, announced that gyms and leisure centres would be able to reopen from 25 July, with strict hygiene and social-distancing measures.The reopening of leisure centres comes as Public Health England said the case for action on obesity has “never been stronger”, who today publish a review of evidence which shows that being overweight remains one of the biggest risk factors in the battle against Covid-19. My colleague Haroon Siddique has the full report. South Australia has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday. While the state has recorded 447 cases since the pandemic began, there are only two active cases currently.Next week, the state will introduce tighter restrictions for residents wanting to return home from Victoria, where the wide-scale lockdowns are in place.Seeing as aged care seems to the focus of both the Victorian and federal government’s attention today, here is an important read from my colleagues Gay Alcorn and Matilda Boseley.They write that the disaster unfolding in Victoria’s aged care homes was “absolutely foreseeable” according to one of the country’s foremost experts in aged care says, who looks at the sector’s issues with poorly trained workers who are often underpaid. Earlier today the Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, announced a Victorian aged care response centre. This AAP report explains a bit more about what the centre will do:The Commonwealth and Victorian governments have established an aged care response centre to assist with the growing crisis in the sector, which has been severely hit by the second wave of coronavirus.Victoria recorded 357 new cases on Saturday, and a further five deaths, bringing the national death toll to 145.There are now over 500 infections in aged care facilities across the state, evenly split between health workers and residents.The new Victorian aged care response centre will assist with workforce provisions, the prevention of outbreaks and support for providers.“That is a very important step forward in helping to coordinate, helping to ensure rapid response where these cases are occurring,” Hunt said.Staff shortages are a problem in Victoria as workers are required to self-isolate while awaiting test results, and only allowed to work at one site.Here’s where we stand right now:"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: Litter in space is a growing problem, and represents a long-standing indifference to caring for the environmentMinister wants local authorities to re-orientate streets towards pedestrians, cyclists and public transportIreland is set to retrofit 500,000 homes and install 400,000 heat pumps by 2030"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needs"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

He did not believe there was a second cluster there.“That site is closed out of an abundance of caution pending further risk assessment by the public health team,” he told the National Public Health Emergency Team briefing at the Department of Health on Thursday.Dr Glynn said that 25 to 30 cases in any setting is “substantial and demonstrates how this disease can spread given any opportunity”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Some people may be \u0026lsquoletting their guards down\u0026rsquo, says a covid-19 contact tracer in GalwayTalks ongoing between two departments about which should drive national strategyCriminal Assets Bureau to go after wealth of Irish criminals or foreign gangs in IrelandExtra teachers, enhanced cleaning regimes and curriculum changes form centrepiece of packageDocumentary uncovers true story behind Prof Ludwig M\u0026uumlhlhausen\u0026rsquos visit to IrelandSouth Great George\u0026rsquos Street location run by Elliott Group closes after worker tests positiveCab officers were granted orders under proceeds of crime legislation at High CourtCase arose from accident when school secretary\u0026rsquos car struck from behind in line of trafficASTIsurvey finds 98 per cent of its members had virtual classrooms from their homesLeader\u0026rsquos victory over Catherine Martin by just 48 votes was much tighter than anybody had anticipatedR\u0026oacuten\u0026aacuten Mullen: Plan to introduce \u0026lsquostatement of truth\u0026rsquo is an attack on \u0026lsquogenuine pluralism\u0026rsquoPlans include \u0026lsquomajor financial package\u0026rsquo to help schools fully reopen at end of AugustIncrease in home improvements contributed to a rise in the volume of waste, report findsRobin Swann voices concerns over \u0026lsquoinability\u0026rsquo of North and South to share data on arrivalsDepartment of Transport to investigate new screening system for arrivalsCommission notes \u0026lsquolacuna\u0026rsquo where ex-TDs cannot be investigated for misconductDecision on opening \u0026lsquowet pubs\u0026rsquo will be taken in two weeks, chief medical officer saysIn closing speech prosection said Aaron Brady was a \u0026lsquoskilled and practised liar\u0026rsquoSupreme Court says Minister has discretion on transfer of application from another EU stateStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312956.1595609267!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"a quiet day is a fantastic day inside a hse contact tracing centre","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNiamh Kelly at the contact tracing centre in Galway. Photograph: Joe O’ShaughnessyIn the HSE’s national contract tracing centre in Galway, they are known by their shorthand “Call 1” and they are tough phone calls to make.Nobody wants to hear – or to tell someone – they have Covid-19, but these calls are essential in the effort to break growing webs of infections, stop the virus spreading and ultimately suppress it.The contact tracer must get the names of the people the infected person has been in close contact with over the previous 48 hours, as they might be infected too and they need to get tested before they spread it.“We have rung people and they may have lost a parent or a spouse to Covid-19 and then you are telling them that they have it,” says Niamh Kelly, a “shift lead” and one of about 30 people working at the Galway centre.“That’s a very difficult thing to hear because they have experienced the true reality of what it means. I have rung single parents who are concerned about their children. I have rung people on their own who are concerned about how they get their shopping, who don’t have family support.”Kelly says it is important not to rush the call. “No call is the same but we take our time.” They know they have to be empathetic and listen. Some people are ill and coughing when they call and need medical attention. Others may be reluctant to admit they ignored public health advice.“Nobody is attributing blame to them for being Covid-19 positive. It is not easy to admit you have been to a house party or on a bus or in gatherings where you are now going to have to name 40 or 50 people who will have to go through this testing and restrict their movements,” she says.Before the pandemic Kelly was an environmental health officer. She and her colleagues are now essentially investigators – Covid-19 detectives – on the trail of the virus and where it might be hiding.“It does feel like we are investigating sometimes because we are trying to draw information out of people: ‘Where have you been what have you done?’ ” says Kelly.On a given day there can be up to 30 calls to new confirmed cases. Worryingly, the number of close contacts of each of those cases has risen 55 per cent in the past week. The average is just over five, so that’s five calls to make for every confirmed case.House partyA concerning trend that has emerged since the country reopened further at the end of June is the very large number of close contacts of new cases, mostly young working adults.They can be groups of 30, 40 or 50 who were at a house party or a casual get-together, or at work, or a group of friends who rented a house in the west or a running group who stopped being as careful as they were with physical distancing when they were exercising.“Things might be just slipping a little in people’s minds and they are seeing more normality out there and letting their guards down a little, where it is important to keep that guard up,” says Kelly.And then there are international flights. Here, the tracing centre becomes an early detection and warning system, tracing clusters back to one source by linking two cases in different parts of the country to the same incoming flight.“We need to get that information. It is absolutely essential for us to do our jobs, like investigators or detectives, to draw that information out of people so that we can use it to get everybody tested and get them to restrict their movements.”Confirmed cases have fallen from several hundred a day. Initially, there were 1,700 contact tracers, including Army cadets, in nine centres during the peak in April. This has now fallen to a handful of staff in one centre, but it has brought benefits, as the small team can share intelligence and spot trends more quickly.“They can connect a cluster you might see in one part of the country to another which might sit under different public health departments,” says Niamh O’Beirne, the HSE’s national lead for testing and tracing, who oversees the Galway operation.“Having them all in Galway, they can hear stories from each other – how that case came off that flight and another says, ‘Actually, so did the case I have,’ so that is two outbreaks and then here is a third. They can connect them all together.”O’Beirne says the “whole trick” of contract tracing is how fast the team can get to newly infected people and their close contacts and get them all tested and self-isolating.“The disease is, largely speaking, in clusters now. That is where you are seeing slightly higher positives now: where the virus got in somewhere and just took hold,” she says, using the construction site cluster in Dublin this week as an example.The average testing and tracing turnaround time is 1.8 days.“Time is critical. Every day that passes is the possibility of having someone out in the community who should be self-isolating or restricting their movements,” says Kelly.The team feel a sense of achievement when they “join those dots” and they have “spotted something that could prevent something bigger happening,” she says.Tracing appThe HSE’s new contact tracing app, downloaded more than 1.3 million times since its launch just over two weeks ago, has thrown up about 100 contacts of confirmed cases in the past two weeks. About half of those detected were people not mentioned as a close contact by a “Call 1”.These can be “people they met and didn’t really know,” says O’Beirne.“It is another way of closing out the spread of this,” Kelly says of the app. “In general – and I personally made calls to those people – they have been quite receptive, surprised maybe,” she says of the close contacts detected by the technology.All the contact tracer can say is the date they came in contact with the infected person.“They might be curious. I am sure they are thinking: ‘Where was I that day and how did I get it?’ ” said Kelly.This week HSE chief executive Paul Reid raised significant, worrying trends: contact tracers spending longer trying to persuade close contacts to go and get tested up to 25 per cent no-shows for the first “day zero” test and up to 50 per cent for the seven-day test – key moments when the virus may be detected in asymptomatic carriers and prevent them from unknowingly spreading it.“I find it hard to understand why people are reluctant to go for a test. Some people say they don’t want to know. They may argue about whether they were a close contact or not. There could be a bit of a denial and ‘I couldn’t possibly have it’,” says Kelly.“You ask close contacts whether they have symptoms: sometimes it is only when you speak to them that they realise that maybe I have had a cough.”Contact tracers assure them that the test will be quick and will provide certainty, and that they may be protecting vulnerable people in their family or community.Hostile calls are “few and far between”, says Kelly.‘Upset and angry’O’Beirne says younger people can “very upset and very angry” because they cannot go to work or are concerned their employer will know or unsure of how to tell friends and family.Calling in public health inspectors or even the Garda, or using public health enforcement to ensure close contacts start showing up to be tested is a non-starter, Reid says contact tracing and testing has to be a voluntary process and relies on goodwill.“If you lose that, you lose it. That is a very fundamental line for health systems. If you get into surveillance, particularly for a health system, it is a very dangerous line to cross,” he says.Reid has about 400 trained people available to bring into the contact tracing operation should cases rise. The Galway centre right now has capacity to manage calls for 150 positive cases a day, says O’Beirne. The trigger to start scaling up is if there are three consecutive days of 100 new cases.“We would know we were heading that way,” she says.What keeps a contact tracer awake at night? “Unrestricted crowds where everybody is unable to keep a physical distance or forgetting to after being out and about for a while. That is frightening for a contact tracer,” she says.“At the moment we are dealing with 30 people. Can you imagine dealing with a hundred or hundreds, trying to contact trace? It is unimaginable really how we would manage that.”Kelly says a “dream day” for her and her colleagues is a “quiet day”.“It’s not because we enjoying drinking coffee. It is because there aren’t cases to inform or contacts to follow up,” she says.“That is our ultimate goal: to see this shrink and shrink and ultimately not be required. We will always be there in case we are needed, but a quiet day is a fantastic day.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4313074.1595628232!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"green party members believe ryan may face pressure to stand down","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEamon Ryan: his supporters in the party said  “a win was a win”. Photograph: Getty ImagesGreen Party members believe Eamon Ryan will come under renewed pressure to stand down at some stage during the Government’s term following his narrow victory over Catherine Martin in the party’s leadership contest. Mr Ryan survived Ms Martin’s challenge to his leadership by a margin of only 48 votes on Thursday, in a contest that was much tighter than anybody had anticipated. While his supporters in the party maintained that “a win was a win”, others pointed to the need for him to review urgently the issues that have ided the party’s 3,000 membership over the past year. In separate interviews on Friday, Mr Ryan would not deal with questions as to leading the party into the next election on the basis that the leadership contest had been completed and the immediate challenges related to the business of Government.At a briefing on the July stimulus, Ms Martin, Minister for Arts and Tourism, was asked about Mr Ryan’s decision not to say when he would stand down. She also said the contest was now over, and added that she had pledged her support to his leadership. “We are only in the first month of this Government. The leadership contest ended last night. We have a job of work to do to heal the ision in the party. I am here to bring stability to the party, and to work to provide the stability the Government needs.”Dublin Lord Mayor and Green councillor Hazel Chu, a supporter of Ms Martin, said the closeness of the contest showed that the party would need to make changes after months of ision and turbulence.She told RTÉ there was a strategic review under way, and Mr Ryan was amenable to change and to make change. She said it was not set to cause ision but to “ensure everyone’s voices are heard”.Both sides in the contest had engaged in an intensive series of phone calls in the dying days of the campaign as it became clear the outcome would be closer than anticipated. It was accepted the vast majority of those opposed to the programme for government backed Ms Martin. According to one of Mr Ryan’s supporters, of those who supported the programme there “were a lot who had no issue with Eamon, but just wanted a bit of a change or a woman to lead, which is fair enough”. Another said a sizeable majority of the Northern membership supported Ms Martin. It came as a new left-wing group affiliated to the party made very direct criticism of the party under Mr Ryan’s leadership, and said his “near loss” in the contest was a demonstration that many in the party believed it was erging from its policy platform. DirectionThe co-chair of the Just Transition group, Cllr Lorna Bogue, said: “Many voted for us on the premise that these are all left-wing policies they simply cannot be described as right wing. “There is a deep feeling within the party – as evidenced by Eamon Ryan’s near-loss of the leadership of the party – that the direction of the party in Government is erging from our election promises and long-standing policy platform.”The group’s 16 signatories include Dublin Central TD Neasa Hourigan as well as a number of Northern representatives, including co-chair Cllr Áine Groogan. The group was given the green light by the party’s executive council but, significantly, Mr Ryan refused to say if he supported the proposal. Ms Bogue also said the group would include people who were not members of the Green Party, raising the possibility it might spin into a new stand-alone party in the future. “If people want to leave the party we support that decision. But we want to provide an avenue for those people to still have a say in how their party works, so their work doesn’t fully go to waste, and so they can hold the Green Party to account on its actions in Government.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4313097.1595623742!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord fg s rural tds take on party s city slickers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tRichard Bruton, the new chairman of Fine Gael’s parliamentary party. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillAn urban-versus-rural battle in Fine Gael this week revived memories of the Great Heave of 2010, when country and western Enda Kenny routed the leadership challenge of city slicker Richard Bruton in a victory described at the time as a win “for the men who eat their dinner in the middle of the day”.At the parliamentary party’s agm on Wednesday night, it looked like the top jobs on the officer board would all go to Dublin-based TDs, with Dublin Bay North’s Bruton standing unopposed for chairman, and Dún Laoghaire’s Jennifer Carroll MacNeill getting the uncontested position of vice-chair. The first-time TD is already an established media performer.Another newcomer, Dublin West’s Emer Higgins, was hotly tipped to win the election for secretary of the parliamentary party. However, a group of rural TDs had other ideas. They included former minister Paul Kehoe, who won his spurs as part of the Phil Hogan team which scuppered Bruton’s assault on Kenny’s leadership. In the run-up to the agm the group mounted a fierce campaign to put another first-timer, retired Mayo footballer Alan Dillon, into the secretary’s job.Kehoe, along with former minister for rural affairs Michael Ring, Clare TD Joe Carey and Mayo Senator Paddy Burke, strongly lobbied colleagues on Dillon’s behalf. Ring proposed his fellow Mayo man on the night and he was seconded by new Senator, Roscommon’s Aisling Dolan.Ringo delivered a passionate nomination speech, pleading with his colleagues to give a voice to rural Ireland at the top level of the party. The city slickers cannot be allowed have it all their own way and they can’t be allowed run Fine Gael, he thundered.Higgins, who was supported at the meeting by former Dublin West TD – now MEP – Frances Fitzgerald, was proposed by Donegal’s Joe McHugh and Galway’s Hildegarde Naughton.“They thought they had it in the bag in 2010 and they thought the same again this week, but we did our homework. The Dubs weren’t going to have it all their own way,” said a jubilant member of the dinner-in-the-middle-of-the-day brigade after their man won through. Emer Higgins is the new assistant secretary.In accordance with party rules, the voting figures have not been disclosed. We’re not sure who counted the votes on Wednesday, but we remember who did the job when Ends and Richard locked horns in 2010. It was then chairman Pádraig McCormack and secretary Paschal Donohoe a young Paschal, upset by the brutal nature of politics, cried his eyes out as he counted the ballots.Alan Kelly adds some bright sparks to his backroom staffLabour leader Alan Kelly has been beefing up his backroom staff. He has just appointed Cónán Ó Broin as his political director, Billie Sparks as new party general secretary and former senator Kevin Humphreys as Labour’s new national organiser.Cónán was one of Kelly’s special advisers when he was environment minister, and went on to work in communications with the Central Bank. A former president of Trinity College Students’ Union, he knows the ropes in Leinster House having previously worked as parliamentary assistant for former TD Robert Dowds.Billie Sparks takes over as general secretary from Brian McDowell and is handing over as national organiser to Kevin Humphreys, who just can’t keep away from frontline politics.She had a strong track record of recruiting women to the Labour party and is a former chair and director of the 50:50 campaign for gender equality in Irish politics.In an effort to stamp out the scourge of real-time leaking to the media from supposedly private proceedings, the Fianna Fáil politicians were asked to hand up their mobile phones at the door. Some flatly refused while younger members were traumatised by the mere idea of doing such an unthinkable thing.“They were like sullen cowboys having to surrender their guns outside a saloon in Tombstone,” said an onlooker.If the politicians are unhappy about using the centre’s vast auditorium as an occasional temporary Dáil chamber, they are also unimpressed by the private facilities.The two parties gathered in their respective cavernous spaces and sat two metres apart from each other at socially distanced desks.A Fianna Fáil backbencher described their surroundings. “The meeting room was huge, the size of a football pitch with big wide pillars we couldn’t see around. It was like sitting the Leaving Cert. There were no microphones so people had to shout.”It was the same setup for their coalition partners. “You should see the size of the place. Speakers had to stand in the middle of the room as there were no microphones because we were afraid the others would hear us. Everyone was roaring.”As it was Fine Gael’s agm, the parliamentary party elected a new officer board. This resulted in many rounds of applause as results were announced and the victorious and the vanquished had their say.But a disconcerted Fianna Fáil could hear all this clapping coming through the wall. After a bruising start to their term in Government, they weren’t sounding so lively. For the first hour or so of their reportedly tense and fractious meeting, there was nothing to applaud.Finally, during a discussion on the July stimulus plan, John McGuinness began his contribution by suggesting speakers pause every 15 minutes for a round of applause for the benefit of their coalition partners on the other side of the partition.This had the desired effect. “The whole thing was mad. At one point, all we could hear was applause from next door,” a Fine Gael TD recalled afterwards. “What was that all about? I had half an idea of putting a glass up against the wall and trying to earwig, but then I thought, ‘sure they’ll only be coming out with the same aul shite as ourselves.’”Zappone lends her expertise to the Biden campaignKatherine Zappone, who lost her seat in February’s general election but remained on as minister for children until the new Government was formed, is back in the thick of electoral politics .Fighting fit and raring to go, the former Independent TD for Dublin South-West has signed up as a full-time volunteer with the Biden campaign and temporarily relocated to the USA. She returned to her home town of Seattle last Friday and has already had a number of meetings with senior campaign figures in Washington State.While considering her own longer-term options, Zappone says she wants to dedicate the next few months to playing an active role in ending the Trump administration by backing and campaigning coast to coast for Democrat Joe Biden. The former TD and senator is expected to attend rallies across the country (subject to Covid-19 restrictions) ahead of the November election while drumming up support among Democrats Abroad for the former veep.As a dual Irish and US citizen, she says her move back to her other home was prompted by Trump’s ill-informed and dangerous response to the pandemic as well as his blatant attempts to row back on equality, fairness and justice. Zappone’s legal challenge with her late spouse, Anne Louise Gilligan, against the ban on same-sex marriage is seen as a watershed moment for marriage equality in Ireland.She will be speaking at town hall meetings – that mainstay of US elections – with a focus on social justice issues, drawing on her experience around marriage equality, repealing the eighth and her co-founding of An Cósan, Ireland’s largest community education service. She will also take part in efforts to rally the Irish-American vote.Bruton has his Father Ted moment in the spotlightRichard Bruton may find himself in the unfamiliar situation of having no senior ministry to call his own, but he seems happy enough in his new role as chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party.When he was elected unopposed to take over from Kildare’s Martin Hayden (new Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture), the former deputy leader’s joy was unrestrained.Upon accepting his great honour he declared: “I feel like Father Ted after he won the Golden Cleric award.”Ted, of course, used his marathon acceptance speech to get back at all those fellow priests who “fecked him over” in the past.Richard was far more reserved, jokingly reprising the Craggy Island PP’s attack on his colleagues in his short acceptance speech but naming no names.At the same meeting Bernard Durkan, thought to be a shoo-in for the coveted position of leas-cheann comhairle, declared in a magnanimous speech that he was not putting his name forward for consideration. The party leadership had already decreed Fergus O’Dowd would be the party’s (and Government) nominee, so Bernard was putting a brave face on what was a fait accompli.Some deputies believe O’Dowd was given the nod because Leo Varadkar has been “rewarding” people who went out and defended his government over the airwaves. The Drogheda-based TD certainly put in a lot of late hours on Virgin Media with Matt Cooper and Ivan Yates over the last couple of years, but Durkan was no stranger to the studio either.It seems some TDs went to the boss independently to plead Durkan’s case in the run-up to Wednesday’s agm.“He’s put in the time batting for the party and he stands in a lot as acting chair in the chamber. He only missed out on leas-cheann comhairle by one vote the last time. There’s a fair few of us annoyed about this,” said a colleague before Thursday’s Dáil vote in which O’Dowd, the coalition-backed nominee, was expected to easily defeat Catherine Connolly, the highly regarded Independent TD for Galway West.Connolly said she was “in shock” after she won the secret ballot. Speculation immediately began over which FGFFGreen TDs embarrassed their betters by voting against party orders. Disgruntled Fianna Fáil TDs have been cast as the prime suspects, but it seems members of Fine Gael had clear motive too.In the outside world, nobody really gives a flying fiddlers about who is or who isn’t the leas-cheann comhairle, but the job isn’t just about winning honour and recognition from your peers.

Photograph: Valerie MaconAFP via Getty ImagesAlmost 40 countries have reported record single-day increases in coronavirus infections over the past week, around double the number that did so the previous week, according to a Reuters tally showing a pick-up in the pandemic in every region of the world.The rate of cases has been increasing not only in countries like the United States, Brazil and India, which have dominated global headlines with large outbreaks, but in Australia, Japan, Hong Kong, Bolivia, Sudan, Ethiopia, Bulgaria, Belgium, Uzbekistan and Israel, among others.Many countries, especially those where officials eased earlier social distancing lockdowns, are experiencing a second peak more than a month after recording their first.“We will not be going back to the ‘old normal’. The pandemic has already changed the way we live our lives,” World Health Organisation (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this week. “We’re asking everyone to treat the decisions about where they go, what they do and who they meet with as life-and-death decisions - because they are.”The Reuters data, compiled from official reports, shows a steady rise in the number of countries reporting record daily increases in the virus that causes Covid-19 over the past month. At least seven countries recorded such increases three weeks ago, rising to at least 13 countries two weeks ago to at least 20 countries last week and to 37 countries this week.The true numbers of both cases and deaths are almost certainly underreported, particularly in countries with poorer health care systems, health experts and officials say. For this report, the Reuters data was restricted to countries that provide regular daily numbers.A surge in cases usually precedes a rise in deaths by a couple of weeks.The United States remains at the top of the case list, this week passing more than 4 million cases and recording more than 1,000 deaths for four consecutive days. At least 1,019 fatalities due to Covid-19 were confirmed nationwide in the US on Friday, following 1,140 on Thursday, 1,135 on Wednesday and 1,141 on Tuesday. Total cases across the United States rose by at least 68,800 on Friday to over 4 million.The numbers have been driven in large part by a surge in infections in Arizona, California, Florida, Texas and California.US president Donald Trump has pushed for schools to reopen, saying that it was critical to the mental and emotional well-being of children and the ability of their parents to work. The CDC issued a call to reopen schools in a statement posted on its website that listed the benefits of being in school and downplayed health risks, although it said exceptions should be made for so-called virus “hot spots.”The guidance does not carry the force of law, and it is unclear how much weight it will carry with school districts. Most teachers unions, which in some states and cities have an outsized political influence especially among Democrats, have fought hard against reopenings.Resurgent casesBrazil and India - which epidemiologists say is still likely months from hitting its peak - have also exceeded 1 million cases.The data reveals a growing number of resurgent cases in countries across all regions.In Australia, officials enforced a six-week partial lockdown and made face masks mandatory for residents in the country’s second-largest city, Melbourne, after a fresh outbreak.Australia and Japan, which also posted a daily case record this week, both warned of a rise in infections among young people, many of whom celebrated the end of social restrictions at bars and parties.In Mexico, which also posted a daily record this week and has the fourth-highest death toll of any country, officials warned that a downward trend in case numbers that began in mid-June - about the time the city began relaxing social distancing measures - could reverse.Based on the rate of hospital admissions over the past week, Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said, hospitalisation levels by October could exceed those registered in June, the height of the pandemic.“It is important to recognise that if we do not change the trend, there could be exponential growth,” she said.In Europe, where the summer vacation season is in full swing, a new daily record figure in Spain is likely to deter tourists from visiting one of the continent’s most popular destinations.In Africa, Kenya recorded a record high daily case number less than two weeks after reopening activity, including domestic passenger flights. President Uhuru Kenyatta, who had announced international flights would resume on August 1st, has summoned officials to an emergency meeting on Monday to discuss the surge in cases.In the Middle East, Oman imposed new restrictions that begin on Saturday in addition to a two-week lockdown that will overlap the Islamic feast of Eid al-Adha after reporting a record number of cases.-ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"King Abdullah warns move could destabilise not only the kingdom but the entire regionPrime minister Omar Razzaz says Israel\u0026rsquos annexation plan would destabilise regionRampant inflation and 30 per cent unemployment places huge strain on societyHopewell Chin\u0026rsquoono seized as part of a crackdown on anti-corruption protestersIsraeli prime minister still awaiting final approval from Washington for implementation of controversial planGovernment under pressure as initial lifting of restrictions now seen as having been too rapidEndeavour intended to stoke Arab and Muslim pride over rich heritage of discoveryCases confirmed in doctors and nurse with concern virus will move fast through campsHealth officials say country in \u0026lsquodangerous place\u0026rsquo after early success in curbing epidemicSpeculation grows that \u0026lsquofire\u0026rsquo may have been deliberate attack on facilityIsrael\u0026rsquos move on West Bank and Trump peace plan blocked by Palestinian rivals\u0026lsquoDefender of Israel\u0026rsquo Boris Johnson says move would be \u0026lsquoviolation of international law\u0026rsquoPlan to annex parts of West Bank condemned by UN commissioner as \u0026lsquodisastrous\u0026rsquoSome 9.3m Syrians are now food insecure, an increase of 1.4m in past six monthsSeparatist insurgents from Balochistan province claim responsibility for attackNo group claimed responsibility for the attack and Taliban has denied involvementThousands of children could die from preventable diseases because of dire state of healthcare, UN warnsArab world unites in opposition and warns of dire consequences if annexation proceedsOnly under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4312065.1595526228!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barnier says trade agreement unlikely between eu and uk","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritish prime minister Boris Johnson holding  crabs  at Stromness harbour during a visit to the Scottish Highlands and Northern Isles. Photograph:   Robert PerryPA WireBritain’s refusal to compromise on fisheries and level playing field guarantees of fair competition have made a trade agreement unlikely, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator said on Thursday. Speaking at the end of a round of talks in London, Mr Barnier said that although there was some progress in certain areas there was none on the key issue of a level playing field on state aid.“By its current refusal to commit to conditions of open and fair competition and to a balanced agreement on fisheries, the UK makes a trade agreement, at this point, unlikely,” he said.Britain’s chief negotiator David Frost blamed the EU, asserting that its proposals did not respect the red lines Boris Johnson identified in a meeting with the presidents of the EU institutions last month.“Considerable gaps remain in the most difficult areas, that is, the so-called level playing field and on fisheries.\u0026nbspWe have always been clear that our principles in these areas are not simple negotiating positions but expressions of the reality that we will be a fully independent country at the end of the transition period,” he said.Mr Frost said the EU had listened to Britain’s concerns about the role of the European Court of Justice in any future agreement and Britain has dropped its demand for a complex suite of separate agreements like those the EU has with Switzerland. However, the issue of state aid remains a stumbling block, and Mr Barnier complained on Thursday that Britain had not yet published details of the state aid regime it plans to introduce from January next year.“We have no visibility on the UK’s intention on its future domestic subsidy control regime. We respect the UK political debate but the time for answers is quickly running out,” he said.A senior British official close to the talks dismissed Mr Barnier’s demand for details of the state aid regime, and said Britain would not commit to any regime as part of its treaty with the EU.“We’re a bit puzzled by this, to be honest, because we don’t quite see why. What is significant about the subsidy regime compared to lots of other areas of domestic policy? “They aren’t asking us to pre-publish in these areas or to kind of pre-commit to future agreements forever in the treaty. And we don’t really see why this is the case either in this area. All we need is a mechanism to resolve disputes between you if there are felt to be unfair subsidies,” the official said.“We’re not going to pre-commit to a particular kind of regime in the treaty with the EU. That’s just not how we’re going to do things.” Second referendumDuring a visit to Scotland on Thursday, Mr Johnson was met by protesters calling for a second referendum on Scottish independence. During a visit to Orkney and the north of Scotland, the prime minister said the response to the coronavirus had shown the strength of the union.However, Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon , who has won praise for her handling of the pandemic, said Mr Johnson should not be exploiting it to make a political point.“I don’t think any of us should be championing or celebrating a pandemic that has taken thousands of lives as some example of the pre-existing political case we want to make. This has been a heart-breaking crisis that we’re not out of yet.

Obese women of the same age will lose three and a half years. Men who are severely obese (a Body Mass Index of 40 or more) can expect to lose almost a decade, while women lose eight years.The research also shows that obesity increases the risk of dying from Covid-19 by 40 per cent, while a BMI of 40 or more increases the risk by 90 per cent. Researchers said excess fat can affect the respiratory system and is likely to affect inflammatory and immune function.  The research shows that just being overweight (a BMI of 25 or more) increases the risk of admission to intensive care with Covid-19 by 50 per cent, with the danger increasing as much as four-fold at a BMI of 40.Health campaigners welcomed the direction of the Government’s policies.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, called for changes to be introduced quickly, in a bid to tackle a growing crisis. He said:  “They will all be keenly fought by commercial interests, just as they have been for the last twenty years as obesity rates have been rising.”The food and drinks industry expressed deep concern. Kate Nicholls, the chief executive of UK hospitality, said putting precise calorie counts on menus which change regularly would cost businesses around £40,000 each time they changed.She said: “At this point in time, imposing those mandatory costs on the industry will just cripple it while it is going through a very fragile recovery. Now is not the time to be imposing further regulatory and cost burdens.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive top private school had culture inflating predicted","story":"Governors at one of Britain’s top private schools were informed about “an issue” with predicted grades in 2018, The  can disclose, as a cache of documents lays bare the extent of its culture of predicted grade inflation.Sevenoaks School in Kent had a policy of increasing the predicted grades of its lowest-performing students in order to help them to secure offers from good universities, according to papers which date back nearly two years.The school – whose former students include the actor Daniel Day-Lewis and Lord Evans of Weardale, the former head of MI5 - also boosted the grade predictions of some better-performing students in order that they were eligible for courses that might have otherwise been out of reach.The practice could have given students at the £38,700-a-year boarding school an unfair advantage over university applicants from schools which took a more stringent approach to grade prediction.UCAS - the organisation which handles university applications in the UK - states on its website that predicted grades should not be “influenced by university of college entry requirements or behaviours”.The predicted grade inflation at Sevenoaks was even laid out in the teachers’ handbook and in the minutes of staff meetings.Documents seen by The  now show that the school governors were also informed about an “issue” with predicted grades at least 18 months ago, but that the practice remained enshrined in the teachers’ handbook until this year.“Predicted grades continue to be an issue – even being taken to governors”, minutes of a 2018 meeting of heads of department state.The papers also reveal that the prestigious boarding school only inflated grades for students applying to UK universities, and not those in America because “US universities do expect students to achieve their predicted grades”.For pupils applying for courses in the UK, the school told teachers that requests to increase the grades of low performing students are “usually accommodated” if doing so “opens up many more courses”.Staff were also advised that the school “may accommodate” requests to inflate the predicted grades of students who wanted “to apply to a course with the requirement above the prediction”, according to minutes of the 2018 meeting.On Friday night, the school refuted any suggestion that it unfairly exaggerates UCAS predictions, and said that it has made changes to its staff handbook following a review by the school governors, “so there can be no doubt that the School follows UCAS principles”.Most students accepted to universities based on inflated grade predictions would still be required to attain certain grades before entry.However, in some cases those pupils who fell short of the requirements could have a higher chance of being allowed onto the course anyway than if they had simply approached through clearing.Tom Richmond, founder of the education thinktank EDSK, said: It\u0027s all about opening doors...from a university perspective, with the student they are already in contact with through the normal application process, it is much easier to say, \u0027Well, you only missed it by one grade or two grades or three grades\u0027 instead of waiting for another wave of applications through the clearing process.Mary Curnock Cook, the former chief executive of UCAS, said it is “understandable” for schools to present their students in the most optimistic light, but that “it’s embarrassing for Sevenoaks that deliberately overpredicting students’ grades is in writing in their guidelines”.But whilst the culture of predicted grade inflation may have unfairly boosted the chances of many past Sevenoaks pupils – this year, the coronavirus pandemic meant that teachers were responsible for assessing students’ final grades for the first time.Sevenoaks uses the International Baccalaureate system rather than A-levels, and submitted a set of predicted grades to the International Baccalaureate Organisation in February – before the pandemic took hold.There is no suggestion that these predictions were inflated.In a carefully-worded letter to staff sent in April, shortly after the public exams were cancelled, the school warned teachers that they would have to be prepared to defend the gap between any predictions sent to UCAS and those sent to the exam board.“These differences are because it’s a different exercise and they are generated at a different time, but this process is not well understood and…you may be asked to explain the rationale.”The school has already been questioned over the practice of inflating predicted grades for university admissions by the Charity Commission.A Sevenoaks spokesperson said: “We are confident in the integrity of our processes and refute any suggestion that we would unfairly exaggerate UCAS or other predictions. We have been in contact with UCAS and are confident in that our processes are in line with their guidelines. All UCAS predicted grades are based on what is realistic and achievable for the pupils, in line with UCAS’s guidelines which make clear that predicted grades should be “aspirational but achievable””. There is no suggestion that Mr Day-Lewis or Lord Evans benefitted from having their predicted grades exaggerated.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gyms could struggle reopen fitness fanatics stick lockdown routines","story":"Gyms could struggle to reopen as fitness fanatics opt to stick to their lockdown routines, businesses said.Fitness centres can reopen from tomorrow, but Huw Edwards, chief executive of UKactive, the trade body, warned that financial pressures mean that could be difficult for some.Glen Hall, of Parkwood Leisure, which runs 80 local authority gyms said it was inevitable that some people will have started working out at home and that it could take a year or more for gym membership numbers to recover. He said Parkwood’s membership list has reduced by 21 per cent.Anthony Franklin, founder of gym-booking app Fibodo, said: “There is a risk that some gym-goers have now formed new exercise habits, and have started running, taking online fitness classes and booking PT sessions in the park, during lockdown meaning they are in no rush to return to the gym. “Their new work from home routine also means they no longer pass the gym on their commute to and from the workplace, with figures suggesting lots have since cancelled their memberships.”Mr Hall said that social distancing also made opening some gyms unviable. He added: “We have a gym that is a 25 station gym and with guidance that becomes eight stations. It is impossible to offer something that stacks up from a commercial perspective.”However, he added: “What we offer is more than just equipment. It’s also the sense of community and the opportunity to interact with someone else.”Research by UKactive showed that 87 per cent of gym members planned to return as soon as their centre reopened.Mr Edwards said that millions of people have been missing their local gyms but that some facilities would be unable to reopen because of the financial pressures of Covid-19.He added: “Physical activity has a central role to play in our nation’s recovery and our gyms and leisure facilities are needed more than ever to strengthen our resilience to Covid-19, as well as the underlying health conditions that have made this virus so deadly.”Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said in parliament earlier this week that he is working with the Culture Secretary to see what further support could be provided to privately run leisure centres.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lutons mayor broke lockdown rules towns coronavirus infections","story":"The mayor of Luton flouted lockdown rules shortly before the town was declared a coronavirus hotspot, the Daily  can disclose.Footage obtained by this newspaper shows Cllr Tahir Malik attending a packed garden party with at least twelve other men, in breach of social distancing rules.Luton Borough Council have launched an investigation into the actions of the mayor and two other senior Labour councillors pictured at the gathering on Tuesday evening.Two days later, Public Health England (PHE) upgraded Luton to an ‘area of intervention’ in response to a flare-up in Covid-19 cases. Health bosses are concerned about infection rates among the town’s large South Asian community, with people living on two terraced streets told to get tested.A series of photographs and videos shows Cllr Malik, who was appointed mayor of Luton in May last year, at the garden party.With a mask tucked under his chin, the mayor is seen laughing and eating with other prominent members of the community including two other Labour councillors, a doctor and a local imam. A video of the event posted on social media was captioned: “A wonderful evening with friends”.According to government rules updated in July, no more than six people or two households can gather outside. At least twelve men including Cllr Malik can be seen sitting closely together in the pictures.During the pandemic Cllr Malik has repeatedly urged Luton’s Muslim community to follow government guidelines “for their own and loved ones’ safety”, including staying at home during the Eid festival.In April he wrote an open letter praising volunteers and emergency services, adding: “Social distancing is very important in our fight against the virus.”However, on Thursday he retweeted a post suggesting the recent spike in Luton had been caused by “false tests”.In Luton, the rate actually fell to 24.8 cases per 100,000 in the week to July 20 from 31.8 the previous week, although Luton Borough Council said it had agreed with Government officials that gyms, pools, and other leisure facilities will not reopen as planned on July 25.Hazel Simmons, the council leader, said: Please pass these important messages on to your family and friends and if you can, stay at home.”Just 47 per cent of potentially-infected people in Luton were successfully contacted by the NHS Track and Trace system since its launch on May 28, amid concern that a language barrier is hampering success rates. Around a fifth of the population do not speak English as a first language, statistics show.As well as Luton, PHE has upgraded Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire to an area of intervention after 122 new cases were recorded in the seven days to July 20.NHS Test and Trace chief Baroness Dido Harding said there were particular concerns about coronavirus spreading in South Asian communities in England.We are all learning what makes different communities, different professions, different parts of the country more vulnerable, she told the BBC.There are a mix of things, and certainly we are seeing a very high prevalence in the South Asian community across the country.All this comes after the mayor of Leicester, another coronavirus hotspot, was caught flouting the rules by visiting his girlfriend at the height of lockdown.Sir Peter Soulsby apologised in June for an “error of judgement”  after neighbours photographed him halfway up a ladder at his partner’s home.Cllr Malik did not respond to requests for comment.A spokesman for Luton Borough Council said: “The council has received complaints concerning the alleged conduct of three councillors. We take all such complaints extremely seriously and an investigation into their alleged behaviour will be started and a decision arrived at.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"offsetting carbon scottish forest greenwashing government official","story":"Shell’s plan to use Scottish forests for carbon offsetting is “greenwashing”, Government officials warned before accepting £5million for the scheme to go ahead.The team at Forestry and Land Scotland (FLS) said that the money was “small beer” for the oil giant and said that they were at risk being “worked over by Shell’s formidable PR machinery”.In emails released under Freedom of Information laws,Jo Ellis, Head of Planning and Environment at the agency, said that she did not “want us to come across as falling for the greenwashing” and planting “will not be sufficient to offset carbon emissions for the long term”.But the partnership to establish a million trees went ahead anyway and was announced in October last year as part of a plan by Shell to offset emissions from customers at their petrol stations across the UK.It comes amid concern from environmentalists the offsetting could be doing more harm than good as people wrongly believe that they are having a positive impact.The five year contract between Shell and FLS is to provide 250,000 carbon units by restoring forests and peatland.Emails between the company and the Scottish Government agency show that they agreed to do so in way that “provides opportunities for positive public communications”The plan is to plant two hundred hectares of native woodland at Glengarry in Lochaber over the next two years, but it has been delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.The third, fourth and fifth year of the partnership will involve restoring native woodland or peatland at sites to be decided.The original planned site, Nether Horsburgh, had to be changed as FLS realised that they had already planted all the trees and therefore could not retrospectively sell carbon credits.The project was announced in October alongside a press release in which Shell claimed that they would be “the first retailer to offset the carbon dioxide emissions from customers’ petrol and diesel purchases” at its UK petrol stations.But internal emails, released after an FOI by investigative website The Ferret, show that FLS had reservations about the claims.In August 2019 Ms Ellis said that she was “excited” about the money that it would bring in, but warned: “I don’t want us to come across as falling for the greenwashing.“The fact remains that mitigation work such as tree planting will not be sufficient to offset carbon emissions for the long term (we need to be reducing the use of fossil fuels) and the tiny amount Shell is putting into green initiatives is dwarfed by what it is still spending on investigating new oil and gas reserves, and in blocking initiatives to set legally binding emissions reductions targets.”Trefor Owen, the Director of Land Management, responded that they needed to get their “lines straight” as “what Shell are offering us is relatively small beer for them, but it gets a shiny new organisation (us) to add to the list of \u0027green organisations’ supporting their offsetting ambitions.”In September 2019 Ms Ellis again raised the issue, saying: “Personally I would have a problem with them saying anything that implies that this is going to make what they do environmentally friendly. This is all about reducing the harm that they do, not about them doing good.”A month later the project was announced and a LinkedIn post by Shell described offsets as “a vital part of tackling climate change” and something that allowed people to have a “positive impact”.Shell have denied that they were involved in greenwashing and said that they have “invested billions” in low carbon technologies. A spokesperson said: “We agree that action is needed now on climate change, so we fully support the Paris Agreement and the need for society to transition to a lower-carbon future. We’re committed to playing our part, by addressing our own emissions and helping customers to reduce theirs.”Simon Hodgson, FLS Chief Executive, said that he valued “the free and frank exchange of views amongst staff” but in the “long haul” of reducing carbon emissions “partnership working is essential”. “No one has the perfect, complete solution for the whole problem of tackling climate change but there are many smaller steps, including enabling more people and organisations to help us plant more trees in Scotland, that can be taken towards arriving at that solution. This is one of them for Forestry and Land Scotland,” he said.It is the second time that the Scottish Government has taken an investment from a major oil company to plant trees, after a £10million donation from BP in 2009.Emails show that FLS discussed the potential for other carbon offsetting projects on land that they own.Mel Evans, senior climate campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said: Tree planting is crucial to fighting climate change, but Shell’s offsetting is merely a hollow gesture while it continues to invest heavily in fossil fuels - actively making the climate emergency worse.“Companies like Shell, BP, airlines and other high carbon pollution-creating industries want to use offsetting to continue business as usual, and that is a con. We can’t ignore the reality – we must cut carbon emissions, not accept false remedies like offsetting.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pc andrew harper case alleged jury tampering referred attorney","story":"The widow of Pc Andrew Harper said she was shocked and appalled after a jury cleared three teenagers of his barbaric murder on Friday, but convicted them of the lesser charge of manslaughter.The trio, who had sat laughing and smirking throughout the trial, were convicted amid allegations of jury intimidation and following the bizarre dismissal of one female juror who was seen repeatedly smiling at the killers during the judge’s summing up.A former policing minister said he was referring the trial to the Attorney General over fears that the jury may have been tampered with while Lord Blunkett, the former Home Secretary, suggested a retrial should have been ordered.Sir Paul Stephenson, the former politan Police Commissioner, said on Friday night he had deep concern.In an emotional statement outside the Old Bailey, Lissie Harper, who had only been married for four weeks when her “incredible, selfless and heroic” husband was dragged for more than a mile behind a car to his death last August, said: “Standing here, before all of you, I honestly thought I would be addressing you following a very different verdict... I am, for the second time in the space of one year, utterly shocked and appalled.The decisions made in these courts, by strangers, will never change the outcome that had already come to us. For many, many agonising months, we had hoped that justice would come in some way for Andrew.”Pc Harper’s killers – Henry Long, 19, and Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both 18 – hugged each other when the verdict was announced. During two trials – the first was abandoned in March as a result of the coronavirus lockdown – the gang from a travellers\u0027 community in Berkshire had been seen laughing in the dock.Even when Pc Harper\u0027s body was compared to a deer carcass after being dragged for more than a mile down country lanes in Berkshire, Bowers, Long and Cole continued smirking.The police officer had tried to intervene when he caught the gang stealing a quad bike. He became entangled in the tow rope attached to Long’s car and dragged to his death. The killers were traced to the Four Houses Corner travellers\u0027 site in Berkshire. Mrs Harper said that she and her family had put our faith in the justice system... to ensure these men were made to repent for their barbaric crimes and added but in reality, they make no difference to the heart-wrenching pain I will continue to feel for the rest of my life.Mrs Harper described his death at the age of 28 as brutal and senseless  and said she was immensely disappointed with the verdict.She paid tribute to a beautiful, loving human being and said: I now have my own life sentence to bear and believe me when I say it will be a much more painful, soul-destroying and treacherous journey than anyone facing a meagre number of years in prison will experience.Following the verdicts, it can now be disclosed that the judge, Mr Justice Edis, brought the first trial to a temporary halt over an alleged potential plot to intimidate jurors.An unidentified person in the public gallery overlooking the courtroom was seen pointing at jurors and the judge ordered extra security measures to protect the jury.Without ulging details, he said police had received information that an attempt is being considered by associates of the defendants to intimidate the jury.Then last Friday  July 17, towards the end of the second trial, an overly friendly juror was seen by a prison officer to mouth Bye boys to the defendants in the dock and continually smiling at them. On being alerted to the incident, Mr Justice Edis said: She must have been compelled by some strong motive to have behaved as she did in this court under the observation of so many. It was both overt and covert at the time, which is remarkable behaviour.The female juror was discharged just a day before the remaining 11 men and women began deliberating on their verdicts.The disclosures caused alarm on Friday. Mike Penning, former policing and justice minister, said he would be writing to the Attorney General Suella Braverman to ask her to investigate.The one thing a jury should be  is completely detached in any shape or form from the people that are being tried. Clearly, the judge had concerns otherwise he would not have discharged the juror.”Lord Blunkett said: It throws considerable doubt on whether the whole of the jury should have been stood down and a retrial required. The verdict also raises issues that I think the law commission should lack in respect of the definition of murder because although it might not be premeditated, it was murder.Richard Benyon, the former Conservative MP for Newbury, whose land is close to the scene killing, said: To see this brutal killing result in such a verdict will cause incredulity in this part of Berkshire.The Attorney General and the Ministry of Justice both declined to comment.    All three of the defendants had denied murder although Long, the ringleader who was driving the saloon car dragging the body, had pleaded guilty to manslaughter.They will be sentenced next Friday but although still facing life for manslaughter are likely to serve far less prison time than if convicted of murder.The officer who led the investigation said the killers had showed no remorse and that their friends and relatives sought to frustrate his investigation.Detective Superintendent Stuart Blaik said: The fact he was a police officer and one of our own of course, it\u0027s paid a huge toll on all of us.”He said it was the defendants\u0027 criminality in stealing a quad bike that put them on course to meet Pc Harper and his colleague Pc Andrew Shaw, with catastrophic consequences.Mr Blaik said: Despite having worked a long shift already they responded to that, and tragically Andrew has paid the ultimate price for that.”The defendants had shown no remorse or helped police piece together what happened, he said, adding: They had every opportunity to do that and it was a conscious decision by them not to assist police from the very outset, all the way through, and even during the trial.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"retail therapy thing past shoppers face mask up friday","story":"A Friday afternoon in July should be the perfect excuse for a day of retail therapy. In lockdown, many will have missed spending the occasional day meandering in and out of shops with a friend, stopping for lunch and then again for coffee or an early glass of wine. But as shoppers arrived at stores today — with the government’s new policy on mask-wearing in full flow — it’s clear the days of leisurely shopping trips are no more. Every shopper is now required to wear a face covering or risk being fined on the spot. At Westfield shopping centre in west London, security guards sporadically stop people not wearing masks, many of whom remain uncertain about the new restrictions.Meanwhile, some shoppers are leaving ahead of schedule, unable to endure the stifling face coverings for long.Julie Piper, 48, says she had anticipated coming for the entire day with her 15-year-old daughter Lila and a friend just as she used to, but found having to wear a face mask too “claustrophobic” to bear.“I don’t think we’ll be here as long as we usually would be,” she says. “Usually we’d spend a good few hours here and really browse and eat and stuff. But I want to get out as soon as I can.”“Normally you come and spend the day, you stop for a coffee. But I don’t think I’d do it again, I wouldn’t rush back, this is terrible.”Being forced to keep her mask on makes the whole experience feel rather less like retail therapy, she says. “It’s not relaxing. You don’t feel you can just meander around and have a shop. You’ve got to do what you need to do and go.”As the centre fills up, some visitors manage to avoid being chastised. Lee Lock, 33, says he won’t be wearing a mask as he doesn’t believe they are necessary. What will he do if stopped and ask to wear one? Leave. But, he says: ’No one’s asked me to.”Josh Addison, 29, says he’ll only wear one if specifically asked to or if there is a “consequence” like the threat of a fine. “The guys at the front today were like ‘have you got a mask?’ And I said no, and they said ‘oh no it’s ok, just asking’. So that greeting alone tells me it’s optional.”Many shoppers simply hadn’t realised the rules on masks had changed. Sozan Jasser, 37, only thought to put her mask in her handbag this morning after a friend called to say she’d been threatened with a fine in her local petrol station. “Otherwise I wouldn\u0027t have been wearing one right now,” she says, adding that she is leaving early as the mask is making her feel faint.“It gives me anxiety, I feel suffocated, I feel strangled, I don\u0027t like it. I didn’t know you had to wear one today and right now I’m ready to go.“I’m not spending as long as I would have if I wasn’t having to wear this.”Not everyone is obliged to wear a mask. Kaz Mohamed, 35, wears a lanyard around his neck stating he is exempt for medical reasons. He has breathing difficulties exacerbated by wearing a mask but finds he has to defend his right not to wear one constantly. “I have to explain myself all the time.”One man holding a mask to his mouth as he walks around explains to a security guard that it broke on the train here. Nicholas Jackson, 62, says: “That’s the last thing I needed. When I got on the platform I sat down to put it on and it broke. I’ve been holding it on on the train all the way here.”Mr Jackson bought one as soon as he arrived so as to avoid further questions. “It’s not a great thing for me because I’ve got respiratory problems, but we’ll persevere.”Walking around the shopping centre, it’s easy to see why people are perplexed by the new rules, which seem to apply in some areas but not others.In some shops, including Topshop, LK Bennett and Marks and Spencer, staff are not required to wear face coverings even though customers are.And while shoppers must keep their faces covered even on the large, airy concourse, it seems they are not required to wear one when they stop at a coffee shop or if walking around having bite to eat.Many feel the new policy is a case of too little too late.As one shopper says. “It’s a bit of a contradiction the whole way through really. I’m just doing it because I have to.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden remains face mask free world","story":"Masks may only have been mandatory in British shops since yesterday, and British airports for a couple of months, but what I saw as I arrived in Sweden this past week already felt oddly transgressive, almost indecent.At no point on the journey does anyone tell you that you can remove your face mask, so when we landed in Stockholm, my fellow passengers on the quarter-full SAS flight from Heathrow kept them on up the gangway and into the airport terminal. Then you notice that the customs officers aren’t wearing them as they check your passport, nor the airport staff swooshing around on silent scooters, but you keep it on just in case. Only when you finally emerge from the baggage hall and into the row of waiting taxis do you realise: nobody is wearing one. Not a single person. In Sweden, it’s a mask-free world.In central Stockholm the restaurants and shops are busy, even if less busy than they might normally be there’s a table-service-only rule, so many bars have queues of patient Swedes outside to avoid any overcrowding inside. The outside watering holes of Stureplan and along the waterfront at Strandvägen are positively booming.There’s nothing reckless or denialist about the atmosphere here nor anything of the grim experiment-gone-wrong that much of the international media would have you believe about a country which did not impose a national lockdown.People are behaving responsibly, social distancing where possible, but determined to continue the serious business of living their lives. In the warm sunshine of a Stockholm evening, I got a sense of a people for whom unencumbered enjoyment of their brief summer — those precious moments of beauty and levity and warmth on the skin — is not a “nice-to-have” that should be surrendered on an uncertain cautionary principle. It is something closer to a human right.I interviewed the architect of Sweden’s Covid-19 policy, Anders Tegnell, for UnHerd’s LockdownTV.It’s fair to say he’s feeling chipper — suntanned, back from his own summer break, and looking at a set of coronavirus figures that are going rapidly in the right direction. Case numbers, having first surged as they massively increased testing, are now coming down dramatically admissions into ICU are now so low that for two days last week there were none at all (the first time that’s happened since early March) and deaths with Covid-19, despite being counted more stringently than almost anywhere in the world, are down to lower levels than ever since the peak.The uncomfortable fact remains that Sweden has had a much higher total mortality per capita than its Scandinavian neighbours (although still under that of the UK), but Tegnell insists that that was mainly the result of poor shielding of care homes, not their lack of lockdown. They’ve improved that and are now seeing the results. Certainly, whatever they are doing now seems to be working — and that doesn’t include wearing masks.Tegnell makes no secret of the fact that he is baffled by other countries’ rush to mandate face masks. “The evidence base for using masks in society is still very weak,” he tells me – despite lots of countries now mandating them in different ways “we haven’t seen any new evidence coming up, which is a little bit surprising I can say.” He believes that masks may be counter-productive as people then forget social distancing and even go out when they are ill, which ends up increasing the spread of the disease. And most importantly, things are going perfectly well without them. “At a time like right now, when we have extremely few admissions into hospitals and the total number of cases is rapidly falling, it is not the time to introduce something else.”All of which, of course, could be said of the UK as well.As a half-Swede I’ve been paying anxious attention to their more laissez-faire response to Covid-19. It seems fair to grant Tegnell his request of deferring full judgement until a year from now, once we know how other countries fare in the autumn and spring. But whatever the final outcome, there is something about the atmosphere of the discussion in Sweden that I wish we had a bit more of in the UK.Decisions are taken entirely by the health agency with almost no involvement from politicians, which lowers the temperature from the outset. Anders Tegnell is a physician and technocrat with no voters to please or polls to fret about. The prime minister has been keeping a distinctly low profile on the issue.There’s also a Swedish bloody-mindedness that in other scenarios can be maddening but in this context is a breath of fresh air. They will stick to their plan, make decisions based on their reading of the evidence, and not bow to social media furores or international condemnation, whether from their Nordic neighbours or the New York Times (who recently dubbed Sweden “the world’s cautionary tale”). At a time of such widespread insecurity and finger-pointing it feels like an oasis of calm.Most of all there’s a clarity about those aspects of life that are worth defending, even in the midst of a global pandemic. Swedish children have not missed a single day of education and they have protected the open society they cherish.Perhaps a culture’s readiness to change on a sixpence to a “new normal” is inversely correlated to their affection for, and confidence in, the “old normal.” The Swedes like their way of life, and are enviably reluctant to give it up.Freddie Sayers is executive editor of UnherdMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph weekly news quiz english town now has highest coronavirus","story":"Following the week that the Queen\u0027s granddaughter, Princess Beatrice, secretly tied the knot, it\u0027s time test your knowledge on the last seven days of current affairs. It\u0027s been a promising week in Britain\u0027s search for a coronavirus vaccine, but which British university is leading the way with the success of recent human trials? In the world of sport, Dom Sibley reached his second test century, but how long did it take him to register his 100 runs against the West Indies? If you\u0027ve been reading this week\u0027s  Front Page newsletters closely you will have come across all of the answers to this week\u0027s quiz.

It has faced continual delays trying to get the current-generation chips on sale already.The latest delay means that its 7nm chips – using even smaller architecture than the current 10nm chips – will not be available until 2022, because of a problem with manufacturing them, Intel said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut it indicated during its otherwise positive results that it had identified the problem and was working to fix it.Intel had hoped that it could make up for some of the delays with the 10mm chips, which had to be pushed back by two years due to repeated delays, by keeping to time with its 7mm designs.Apple buys Intel 5G modem business, dropping major hint at new iPhoneBut the new sixth month delay means that the chips will not be available until 2022, with full production not available until the following year.The company may be forced to have some of them produced by external manufacturers as part of contingency plans, it suggested. Intel is somewhat unusual among chip makers in that it both designs and manufactures its chips, before selling them to other companies to include in their own computers.While customers generally don\u0027t buy the chips themselves, such delays can lead to consumer devices being pushed back too – or not appearing at all.Some Apple computers are thought to have already been delayed or changed as a result of Intel\u0027s chips not becoming available, for instance. The company announed last month that it would move away from Intel\u0027s chips, instead designing its own.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The pop star collaborated with a number of her “musical heroes” for the record, including her frequent songwriting partner and co-producer Jack Antonoff, plus The National’s Aaron Dessner, and Bon Iver. Upon the album’s release, Swift shared a prologue of sorts explaining her thoughts and feelings surrounding the album. The prologue will also feature in packaging for CD and vinyl versions of Folklore.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRead the prologue in full below:“It started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity.Alanis Morissette’s Such Pretty Forks in the Road is a career bestTaylor Swift fans think Karlie Kloss dropped a Folklore Easter Egg “Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later. Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down. The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of “let’s run away” and never doing it. The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine. A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor. A whiskey bottle beckoning. Hands held through plastic. A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate.“Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I’ve never met, people I’ve known, or those I wish I hadn’t. An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isn’t his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942. A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out.“A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around. Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and fiction become almost indiscernible. Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someone’s secrets written in the sky for all to behold.“In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. I’ve told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve.“Now it’s up to you to pass them down.”Swift’s album has received critical claim in early reviews. The Independent gave it four stars and called it a “near-perfect album”, praising Swift’s songwriting as “exquisite, piano-based poetry”.Read the full review here.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Take a walk at Virginia WaterSharing the full story, not just the headlinesThis spectacular destination is only part of a vast, aristocratic pleasure ground of woodlands, parks and meadows that would take weeks to fully explore on foot.The 4.5-mile circuit of the lake takes you past an eclectic mix of attractions, including an ornamental cascade waterfall, Roman ruins brought from Libya and an authentic 100ft-high totem pole gifted by British Columbia.With so much space, there is plenty of room for a secluded picnic too.See windsorgreatpark for more information.2. Cycle the New ForestWhether you discovered a love of cycling thanks to the lockdown or have been a convert for many years, the traffic-free and waymarked trails of the New Forest make it an enticing spot for all levels of rider.If you want to leave your wheels at home, there are plenty of local bike-hire options, which can also provide advice on the best routes for your party – from easy family jaunts to long-distance challenges.See thenewforest for information on cycling routes.3. Hike through the Chilterns Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingChef Tom Kerridge on reopening his Michelin-starred pub safelyAn area of outstanding natural beauty with rolling hills (such as Coombe Hill, above, the highest vantage point in the area), the sparkling chalk streams and ancient woodlands right on London’s doorstep sounds too good to be true, but the Chilterns offer precisely that.With over 300 square miles of scenery and attractions to absorb the crowds, a quiet route is also a walker\u0027s goal. The Chilterns Conservation Board and Chiltern Society have developed a series of 23 walks across the Chilterns which are social-distance-friendly, taking in hill climbs and gentle ambles.Visit chilternsaonb.org for more details about their social-distance-friendly walks.4. Kitesurf at Camber SandsCamber Sands has over two miles of beach to absorb the post-lockdown crowds. The eastern end, marked with black and white flags, is reserved for activities such as kitesurfing, and there is plenty of space for novices to learn how to handle a power kite on land or water.An introduction from The Kitesurf Centre covers the fundamentals and can be booked as one-to-one coaching, as a single group from the same household, or in groups of up to three people from separate households.The nearest train station is in Rye, four miles away. A six-hour introduction to kitesurfing course starts at £99, minimum age 12. See thekitesurfcentre for details.With the pools closed and the seaside crowded, many swimmers are looking elsewhere to take a dip. Far from the chlorinated confines of the local swimming bath, a fresh water reservoir, lake or river can be an exhilarating alternative, but there are many safety issues to consider before getting wet in the wild, so make sure you read up on the hazards first.​See outdoorswimmingsociety for advice and a directory of open-water swimming lakes to explore.6. Learn to jet skiThe beaches could be busy, but you can leave the crowds in your wake after completing a Royal Yachting Association (RYA) personal watercraft course that, in just one day, provides you with all you need to safely helm a jet ski inland or on the coast.There are plenty of places in the UK that can teach you – such as Jetski Safaris in Poole – and no experience is necessary.Visit jetskiandpowerboattraining for more information. Single-person RYA proficiency course for jet skis from £180.7. Ride on an Olympic bike trackThe Hadleigh mountain bike track hosted the London 2012 Olympics and has evolved since then into one of the premier cross-country destinations in the UK.Hadleigh Country Park also provides one of the largest green spaces in Essex, with plenty of opportunities to explore the coast from Southend-on-Sea to Benfleet. The nearby castle ruins offer panoramic views of the River Thames and Kent on the opposite shore.Leigh-on-Sea or Benfleet stations are the closest to the country park. It’s a 10 to 20-minute ride from there to the track. See explore-essex for details.Meet the kayaking instructor...Having been cooped up during lockdown, it’s safe to say that large numbers are wanting to experience the great outdoors like never before now businesses are reopening.“We\u0027ve been ridiculously busy,” says Adrian Fall, below, owner of Brighton-based The Kayak Coach. “People have been so excited about being on the water.”Fall\u0027s passion is teaching people how to kayak, canoe and paddleboard – then leading them on trips up Sussex\u0027s beautiful estuaries and rivers.He set up The Kayak Coach almost 12 years ago and has just taken on two extra staff to add to the three he already employs teaching and guiding on the water: “I love being outside and now\u0027s the time to meet people again and introduce them to the sport I love,” he says.Reopening the business required important changes, as per Government guidelines. Group sizes have been reduced from eight to five to comply with social distancing – “It\u0027s actually a nicer experience for everybody,” Fall adds – and all equipment (boat, buoyancy aid, helmet) is cleaned and sterilised after each use.A one-way system has also been added to its training centre at Ashurst. “We\u0027ve made changes to what we do. But we\u0027re almost back to normal in terms of what we can offer,” Fall explains. Additionally, barrels of water are provided for sailors to wash their hands before and after each session. Fall admits that the past three months of enforced closure have been tough for the business and lovers of the outdoor life, but that people are “having to look locally because they\u0027re not going to France or America”. He adds: “They didn\u0027t know we were here, but they\u0027re excited about accessing the river on our doorstep.”See thekayakcoach for more detailsTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You Go Please keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism. So do please make sure you check the respective official sources for information before you travel.Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

This is by no means a downgrade – after all, international tourists marvel at the UK’s impressive array of country house hotels, seaside cottages, boutique hotels, traditional inns, pubs-with-rooms and campsites on offer. But for a holiday to remember, a spot of glamping is hard to beat.For those of us who’ve had our appreciation for nature reawakened by lockdown, a glamping stay at a British yurt, gypsy caravan, shepherd’s hut or barn delivers a change of scene, outdoorsy activities, locally-sourced food, charming surroundings, luxury and comfort. Here are some key things to think about before your book...A beginners\u0027 guide to glamping Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGiven the wide range of accommodation on offer, there really is a British glampsite perfect for every traveller. Just make sure you ask yourself a few simple questions before you book.For example, is there phone signal or Wi-Fi? A forced digital detox could be stressful if you’d hoped to stay contactable, but some travellers will consider it a bonus to be out of reach.Also, is there a pub, cafe or shop within walking distance, or will you need to arrive fully self-sufficient? Strolling to a local farm shop for daily provisions adds to the charm of glamping, whereas driving 30 minutes to the nearest supermarket is less of a joy.Equally importantly, what are your rainy options? This might be anything from a Scrabble marathon with a bottle of Merlot, or an underground caving adventure.Stay safe and have fun with this important travel guidance:Only travel in a car with members of your household andor support bubbleAlways wear a face covering or mask on public transportWash your hands before putting on your face covering and after you’ve taken it offWash your face covering dailyWhere possible, leave the car behind and reach your destination by walking or cyclingThe joy of glamping is that you can be packed in under half an hour – there’s no need to spend hours decanting instant coffee into tiny containers, searching for your head torch in the loft, and spending the drive wondering if you forgot the tent pegs. Bad weather is less of a concern too: a week under canvas isn’t much of a holiday, but cosying up in a gypsy caravan or yurt during a storm can be downright romantic.It\u0027s this convenience, comfort and peace of mind that you’re paying for when you book a glampsite, so don’t overthink the trip or stress about your packing list. Leave that to the camping crew.Whether you\u0027re an extrovert adventurer or a laid-back stargazer, there\u0027s a glamping holiday in the UK for you. Here are great staycation selections to inspire you...Go back to your rootsThe Faraway Treehouse in Cumbria is straight out of a fairy tale, with plush velvet curtains, a roll top bath and a balcony to spot deer from during the day. The treehouse is bound to be a hit with families, but it’s a ridiculously romantic getaway for couples too.Faraway Treehouse sleeps two (with space for two children at no additional charge), from £165 per night.Get away from it allTo really get away from it all, take the ferry to the Isle of Skye and bunker down in a beautifully decorated yurt from Skye Yurts. Be sure to stay for at least five nights to hike this gorgeous island, kayak the coves, dine at the Michelin-starred Kinloch Lodge and generally feel a world away from reality.Base rate is £80 per night for two people.Step back in time – with modern comfortsLawnsgate Camping in the North York Moors offers glamping options including a yurt, gypsy caravan (pictured above) and cabin, as well as conventional tent pitchesThis is a working farm that has been in the family for generations, so it’s the real deal, and the picturesque nearby villages and on-site llama-trekking means there’s plenty to do.The Yurt is from £90 per night The Gypsy Caravan is £55 per night and The Game Larder is £60 per night. Watch the starsThe popular glampsite Finn Lough in Enniskillen offers superb stargazing opportunities through the transparent walls of the camping ‘bubbles’.Kayaking, hiking, wakeboarding and other outdoor activities are available nearby, and this scenic corner of Northern Ireland is also well worth exploring by bike or car.Prices start at £265 per night for domes or £145 for suites.Talk with the animalsYou don’t need to splurge on an African safari to spend the night surrounded by lions, tigers and bears.Glamping prices start from £350 per night.How Gilcombe Farm got ready to welcome glampers When events had to be postponed, Amelia Griffin and husband Simon Gerrard, pictured above, sought a new venture to add to their Crescent Moon events company.The solution? A glamping site on 300-acre Gilcombe Farm just outside Bruton in Somerset, near where they live. “It’s lovely countryside,” Griffin says. “There’s loads of gorgeous walks, and people can come just to enjoy the great outdoors.”The site hosts 10 Lotus Belle tents with comfortable Moroccan-style interiors, each eight metres apart with their own designated toilet and mini kitchen. “We could have put more tents in, but didn’t want to because of the present situation,” Griffin explains.Four-day bookings from Thursday to Monday enable the tents to be cleaned and left empty for a few days, and hand sanitiser is widely available on the site.The farm shop offers local produce and delivers to the tents. The couple have also added yoga classes, and outdoor film screenings when all 10 tents are booked.Your staycation checklist: know before you goMany locations across the UK are reopening but are restricting visitor numbers and offering pre-booked time slots. Keep these four points in mind when preparing for your next staycation…CHECK THE GUIDELINES: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland all have different rules in place check their respective tourism sites before you travelBOOK IN ADVANCE: If you’re visiting an attraction, book slots in advance where possibleGO OFF THE BEATEN TRACK: Try to visit less popular places and to avoid overcrowded areasPACK YOUR BAGS: Bring a card for contactless payments and always keep hand sanitiser on youTo help plan your trip visit Know Before You GoPlease keep in mind that England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland currently have different guidelines, advice and timelines for reopening tourism.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Several areas in England are experiencing a surge in new coronavirus cases, with places in the North West appearing most at risk to a second wave of infections similar to the one seen in Leicester.The latest figures from Public Health England reveal Bradford and neighbouring Kirklees in West Yorkshire have seen high numbers of daily confirmed cases in recent days.Higher infection rates in Leicester prompted the government to introduce a local lockdown just weeks after nationwide containment measures first began to ease.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Leicester’s lockdown last week, epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson warned that more localised lockdowns in the UK are “inevitable”.The former government adviser said that an estimated 8 per cent of the UK population has so far been infected, and that the pandemic is still in its “early stages”.Leicester remains the worst affected area in England in terms of cumulative case rate, with more than 1,000 people per 100,000 residents having been infected by Covid-19.Other areas to have experienced similarly high case rates include Ashford in Kent and Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria, however both places have seen new cases fall substantially since May.The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ashford began to flatten off in early June, according to data collected by PHE. By contrast, daily cases in Leicester appeared to accelerate at around the same time.A similar surge occurred in Kirklees, despite the curve initially appearing to flatten one month ago. The number of new daily cases consistently fell below 20 in the first week of June, before spiking to more than 40 on 11 June.In Bradford, the number of new cases fell significantly in late May, before rising again throughout June. Unlike Kirklees, however, the rate of new infections appears to be once again slowing.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

As well as two Michelin-starred pubs – The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach – he also opened a traditional butcher and founded Pub in the Park, the biggest food and music festival tour in the UK.During lockdown, staff from Kerridge’s businesses were volunteering to help a new charity called Meals from Marlow which delivers free food to NHS staff, key workers and people in need. This started small in early April and with support from over 1,000 donors, it recently ended up serving its 75,000th meal.From 4 July, both The Hand \u0026amp Flowers and The Coach have reopened fully in Marlow to welcome back hungry diners.7 great summer days out for the familyThe team have prepared a comprehensive Covid-19 policy document with a number of measures to protect the health and safety of guests and staff. Measures include daily staff temperature checks, hands-free antibacterial gel dispensers, one-way systems, private sole-use of bathrooms, cleaning touchpoints and toilets every 20 minutes, and even sanitising deliveries.Kerridge is also working with a company that provides protection against a wide range of pathogens, including Covid-19, using a sanitising treatment applied through fogging machines to provide an even coat on all surfaces, followed by manual application to hot spots, such as door handles.Form a bubble with a one-adult householdVisit your local salon, restaurant or bar, following UK Government guidelinesMeet in private gardens with up to six peopleTravel on public transport without a face covering or maskShare a car with people outside of your householdFor more information, visit gov.ukcoronavirus“Welcoming, safeguarding and taking care of others is at the very heart of what we do, says Kerridge. The last few months have been such a challenging time and we have been eagerly waiting to establish a little normality back into everyone’s lives, and get back to what we do best – providing great hospitality and food.”Kerridge\u0027s pubs have also been altered to make sure that spacing is as per UK Government guidelines. Partitions have been placed to ensure people have privacy and are able to enjoy their experience in the same way as before.Following the success of Meals from Marlow, it has now become a permanent charity and is set to provide 30,000+ meals a year to local people. “I know the people of Marlow are a very generous group but I’m astonished by the speed and the level of kindness, says Kerridge. Thank you, Marlow, I’m proud of you.”Colin Steele and Jade Windsor, pub landlords of the Falcon InnColin Steele and Jade Windsor, pictured below, took over the Falcon Inn five months before lockdown, restoring the pub as a community hub at the heart of the village of Fawley, Hampshire. After coronavirus threw a ner in the works, they were eager to reopen last weekend. “We have social distancing, hand sanitisers and a booking system, so our locals get a guaranteed spot,” says Windsor.The couple made the most of the lockdown by revamping the pub, painting the interiors and outside fencing, and putting up a pergola in the garden for some weather protection. “Because of lockdown we had the time to give the garden the love and attention it really needed,” says Steele. “Painting the fence outside has meant that we\u0027ve been able to interact with the village as they walk past. We\u0027ve been trying to bring that community spirit back.” To keep business going, they opened their car park for plant sales and teamed up with local company HMS Spirits to serve takeaway cocktails on Friday nights, which they will continue on weekends throughout the summer. “It kept us doing what we love, says Windsor, and keeping in contact with our customers.” They also recruited a chef with the goal of making back some of the lost income from closure and the now-reduced capacity that allows for distancing. Where they once accommodated 150 inside, now they can host 40. The team have ramped up hygiene measures: doors are wiped every half hour screens at the bar and face shields protect staff. Additional outdoor seating means that everyone is seated, and a new app will enable customers to order food from their tables. “We\u0027re a family-run business and everyone just wants us to succeed,” says Steele.Windsor adds: “I\u0027m sure we will come across a few issues, it’s something that no one\u0027s ever had to deal with before. I want my pub back the way it was more than anyone, but we\u0027ve all got to deal with it together.”Sarah Bentley, owner of The Cutting Room unisex salon As a small village salon that’s been open for 16 years, it’s little wonder that The Cutting Room’s loyal clientele had been keenly anticipating its reopening after temporarily closing back in March.A tight-knit team with great customer relationships, Bentley and her employees were excited to get back to a sense of normality. After a meeting last week, they felt reassured about the safety precautions put in place for their return. “It was a bit of relief coming back from staff training and just seeing everybody’s face light up and looking forward to being back,” she says. “We’ve had Zoom meetings discussing all the guidelines.”The salon may have been closed, but plenty was going on in the background to ensure that the premises and the team were as prepared as possible for a safe reopening.For example, they worked hard to keep customers informed about changes to their haircutting experience: as well as the salon now being appointment-only, clients have been informed that they are not able to enter the premises before their appointment, as well being asked to wear a face covering.“Because we are such a small salon, we have screens up between all our sections,” Bentley explains, adding that their booking and payment system has been made completely contactless.Though refreshments or magazines can no longer be provided, The Cutting Room has set up its outdoor space for clients to sit in a socially-distanced manner.The Cutting Room\u0027s kit used has also changed: “We’ve got disposable gowns, towels – everybody’s got all their completely own equipment it’s all labelled in their name – their own trollies, Bentley adds.Ultimately, safety is The Cutting Room’s number-one priority. “It’s there to keep us and the clients and my staff safe – and if I felt that they weren’t safe, I would shut the salon tomorrow,” Bentley says. “Everybody’s health comes first.Keeping you safe: a selection of guidelines for UK businesses All businesses are required to be Covid-19-secure in order to help protect their staff and customers. Here are some of the guidelines that salons, pubs and restaurants have been provided with:All businesses will have conducted a risk assessmentThorough and enhanced cleaning facilities will be available for staff and customersBookings will be limited to ensure social distancing and risk mitigationCustomers will be provided with guidance prior to their visitWorkers in continuous close contact to clients, such as hairdressers, will wear visors to promote safetyStaff will be split into teams or shift groups where possible to limit contactIndoor and outdoor seating will be reconfigured to maintain social distancing guidelinesStaggering entry times and introducing one-way systems throughout venuesContact between kitchen staff and front of house staff will be minimisedTo find out more about business guidelines, visit gov.ukguidanceworking-safely-during-coronavirus-covid-19Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Former IMF chief Christine LaGarde has praised female leaders around the world for their “stunning” response to the coronavirus pandemic, especially when compared to their male counterparts.Ms Lagarde, who now heads the European Central Bank, said the policies adopted by female heads of state were proactive and their communication style was clear.“I would say that for myself I’ve learned that women tend to do a better job,” she said.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe added: “This is my woman’s bias and I indulge in ceding to this bias.”The top 10 worst affected countries are all led by men, both in terms of total number of cases and cases per million people.It is difficult to make a like-for-like comparison without considering factors like health expenditure, tourism and population density. There are also far fewer women in positions of power, with only around 10 per cent of countries having a female leader.A recently released study attempted to factor in these variables, finding that on every metric female-led countries performed better than male-led countries.When comparing countries with similar population sizes, such as Ireland and New Zealand, the researchers found that countries with women in charge experienced far fewer cases.The paper, written by economists Supriya Garikipati and Uma Kambhampati, hypothesised that female-led countries fared better due to qualities shared by female leaders.Previous studies have found that women are more risk averse and favour a style of leadership that is empathetic and science-based.The researchers suggested that these traits meant women leaders risk averse with regard to lives, but prepared to take significant risks with their economies by locking down early.Prioritising economic outcomes has been one of the reasons for the US not imposing a nationwide lockdown, which has contributed to surging case numbers.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the sight of Mr Erdogan leading the prayer stunned observers, with some describing it as yet another blow to Turkey\u0027s secular republican system. In practice what we’ve seen here is the fusion of religious leadership and political leadership, said Kadri Gursel, an analyst in Istanbul. It is the transgressing of borders between the political and religious leadership, and the embodiment of the two in one person. It’s a historical moment no one can deny it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFollowing Mr Erdogan\u0027s recitation, the head of Turkey\u0027s religious affairs ministry, Ali Erbas, took to the pulpit to deliver a sermon which touched on themes of Muslim victimisation. What could be more crestfallen than a mosque, the minarets of which are silent, the garden of which is deserted, the dome of which is mute, and the garden of which is lonely? he said. Due to the hostility to Islam that rises each passing day, there are mosques in various parts of the world today that are attacked, closed by force, and even bombed and destroyed, he said. Hundreds of millions of Muslims are facing oppression... We as believers who regard the meaning of Hagia Sophia as a lofty cause and sacred entrustment need to work to ensure that compassion, tolerance, peace, tranquillity, and benevolence prevail all around the world.Istanbul’s Hagia Sophia had been officially a museum until two weeks ago when Mr Erdogan redesignated it a Muslim house of worship following a court decision. The move was controversial, potentially damaging an institution that was seen as a symbol of interfaith harmony between Muslims and Christians and a nod to the secular legacy of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey. But the move proved popular among supporters of Mr Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted Justice and Development Party as well as strident Turkish nationalists. Hundreds of pious Turks could be seen rushing towards the Hagia Sophia to take part in Friday’s ceremony, some chanting “God is great”.The enduring fight for the Hagia SophiaIstanbul’s iconic Hagia Sophia to be turned back into mosqueThe debate over the future of Hagia Sophia explains modern TurkeyErdogan recites Islamic prayer at Hagia Sophia triggering outcry Turkish media reported thousands of worshippers arriving from around the country to witness the prayers, with officials beseeching potential visitors to stay away from the area to avoid overcrowding around the leafy square and ancient quarters near the Hagia Sophia amid the coronavirus pandemic. Turkey continues to report hundreds of new infections daily, adding to a total caseload approaching a quarter of a million. The Hagia Sophia, considered among the most cherished masterpieces of Byzantine-era architecture, was converted into a mosque following the 16th-century Ottoman conquest of the city that was then Constantinople. Its status as a museum has long irked pious Turks alienated by the country’s secularist governments.

The parenthesis of the last century when we were doomed with defeats is closed.”Turkish pro-government voices mocked opposition leaders for not attending the prayer ceremony. But Istanbul mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, of the Republican People’s Party (CHP), said that he was not invited. Kemal Kılıcdaroglu, chairman of the CHP, rejected an invitation to attend the ceremony. Mr Gursel described the ceremony, which coincided with the anniversary of the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne that outlined the contours of modern Turkey, as a political move intended to rejuvenate the AKP\u0027s base of supporters at a time of multiple overlapping crises. We see today an Erdogan exhausted and deprived of instruments offering him better positioning and better terrain to generate legitimacy, he said. Turkey\u0027s economy is in shambles. The future is grim. Its foreign policy is in crisis, Its society is in crisis. Mr Erdogan is out of capacity to solve any of the existing crises.Turkish officials have said the Hagia Sophia, a major tourism draw, would continue to be open to visitors of all faiths, and that entrance fees would be lifted. For prayer services, Turkish religious authorities have covered up Christian religious icons showing human imagery considered idolatrous in the Sunni sect of Islam. There are, however, plans to allow them to be visible except for during five daily prayer times. Turquoise prayer rugs have also been installed as part of an ongoing renovation.  Some historical preservationists have expressed concern. “It appears that the authorities have chosen to instal a (presumably retractable) curtain mechanism to conceal the mosaics of Virgin and Child on the apse, and the Archangel Gabriel,” wrote Washington-based Turkey scholar Tugba Tanyeri-Erdemir, voicing concern about the mere two-week period used to prepare the building for prayers.“The choice of materials for the curtain is crucial. Is the fabric concealing Hagia Sophia\u0027s mosaics fire retardant? Is it evaluated for pest control and dust accumulation?” she wrote on Twitter. “When we are dealing with ancient buildings we need to carefully assess all risk factors.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We have no interest in escalation, but we will do all that is necessary to protect Israeli citizens”.Shortly after the blast on Friday morning, the IDF said that it was ”elevating its readiness to defend Israel’s northern border from all enemy threats with changes to troop deployment and enhanced field intelligence activity in the area”.Shortly after its retaliatory strikes, the IDF tweeted: We hold the Syrian regime responsible and will respond to any violation of Israeli sovereignty.Additional reporting by agenciesNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We knew it cracked down on all domestic opposition. We knew of the way in which they were undercutting the economies of the West.But not until the spread of the Wuhan virus did so many people come to realise how untrustworthy the Chinese leadership is.Now, every day brings more bad news about China. It isn’t because China is doing any-thing new. It is because China has caught the world’s attention.Not in a good way.Just consider the events of recent days.The Chinese government’s mistreatment of its Uighur population in the province of Xinjiang has been known about for years.The Muslim minority group, who regard themselves as closer to Central Asian countries — their language is related to Turkish — have long been in the government’s sights.Armed guardsFor years the Chinese Communist Party has had Xinjiang under its version of special measures.Claiming the one-time independent state, which borders eight countries, constitutes a special security risk, the communists have had the people there under mass surveillance.Even before the recent mass imprisonment, they have had them subjected to forced labour.In recent years they have subjected the entire population to compulsory birth control to try to reduce the size of the population.But for years the world’s attention was not focused on this.We all had troubles of our own to look to.So the Chinese authorities got away with putting perhaps as many as one million Uighur people in what are basically concentration camps — places where these people are meant to be “re-educated” and otherwise “corrected”.Now, drone footage has surfaced which shows shackled, blindfolded prisoners in the province being marched on to trains by rows of armed guards.The scenes are awful.As our Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab, rightly said at the weekend, they are “reminiscent of something we have not seen for a very long time”.He is right.Yet when the Chinese Ambassador to our country was asked about this at the weekend, he pretended to have no idea what the footage was.He even tried to ert attention by asking his inter- viewer whether he had ever himself been to the charming province in question.But we are not as easily distracted by China as we used to be. Every day brings fresh causes.First, we had China’s appalling behaviour in Hong Kong, breaking its agreements with the UK and cracking down on the local population.Then last week came our Government’s decision to remove Chinese firm Huawei from any involvement in Britain’s G network.Huawei is basically a Chinese government agency and it would have been a serious security breach to allow it to control all our internet communications. Or to develop a back door for looking into them.Then a number of senior Conservatives warned that social media app TikTok is “as much of a threat” to Britain as Huawei.That may sound funny to parents whose children are addicted to it.For most of us, the app is just a source of amusement or bemusement.Depending on your age.But whatever your reaction to it, a growing number of people believe Chinese tech-nologies like TikTok are not safe. Because TikTok’s parent company is ByteDance, a Chinese firm founded in .Of course, the company claims to be independent, as all such firms do, but in China major firms are not independent as they are in Britain or other free societies.Critics insist TikTok could easily be used by hostile forces to harvest information from, and otherwise target, all those who use it.Of course, all of this has brought a degree of sabre-rattling from Beijing.China’s leaders have got used to telling everyone  what to do.As they spread their financial wings in recent decades, countries like ours were very keen to enjoy the benefits.Universities in the UK repeatedly took money from China. Money with strings attached.But money that some of our greedier universities thought was free. Only later learning otherwise.Naturally, the turnaround of recent months has been badly received in Beijing.Its ambassadors and state media have spent recent days pretending it is Britain that is the untrustworthy partner.They are wrong.We are not inconsistent or unfair. We are simply a country that has begun to wake up to a threat.Like the rest of the world. And not a moment too soon.Jaguar Land Rover builds cars for them under a joint venture with Chery Automobile. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has , employees in China across several manufacturing sites, as well as an innovation centre and a ­campus.So as tensions ramp up after the decision to remove Huawei from the UK’s G network, Britain should remember it, too, has aces to play. Most notably tech and skills.To learn about these is why so many Chinese students come to our universities. It is the same reason why state-owned China General Nuclear Power is a one-third partner in the new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset.It will have a front-row seat to the latest tech as China prepares to build around  reactors of its own.Saying no to Chinese firms is not to be taken lightly.There are around , Chinese companies that do business in the UK. The largest  employ , people.But let’s not forget they need us too.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He seems fine.” Seriously Let’s hope this was just an attempt at media distraction and that, behind the scenes, he and other influential friends are telling Kanye the truth he so badly needs to hear — that he needs serious, prolonged treatment for his mental health, and fast.And , like so many famous people, he’s surrounded by “yes men” who put profits before their clients’ health, then they too need to support his we and family in their bid to get him treatment.It won’t save his presidential chances, but it might just save his le.JOHNNY Depp reportedly referred to Magic Mike star Channing Tatum as “potato-head”.A hot potato though, right SHOW me the boy of seven and I’ll show you the man.Fellow pupils who attended the private Durham School with Dominic Cummings describe him as isive, argumentative and “contemptuous” of his peers, with a look on his face that suggested: “I know better, I’m tolerating you.”A description that will no doubt sound familiar to the entire Cabinet. Without the tolerance bit.A last-breath act of motherly concern that was perhaps down to the phenomenon known as “hysterical strength” – where human beings suddenly find an extreme power in a le-or-death situation.Either way, how heartbreaking that she couldn’t also save herself.THIS is the cover of Sports Illustrated’s  “swimsuit” issue.Or, in the case of Jasmine Sanders, centre, three strategically placed pieces of dental floss.Doubt she’d hear them from LA anyway.GHISLAINE Maxwell broke down in tears while appearing via video link in a New York court.Reportedly, this was because she was denied bail. Either that or she caught sight of this court sketch.THE sales of packet trle kits have soared during the pandemic as we make a nostalgicto the s favourites of our childhood.As someone who has recently consumed bucketfuls of butterscotch Angel DelightI can concur with this finding, though I draw the line at powdered mash brand Smash.Tinned peaches has been another, resurrected favourite, and I was very excited to find a jar of Sandwich Spread which I adored as a child but now tastes slightly too vinegary for my adult palate.We had ready-made custard in a cardboard carton the other dayand The Bloke had a sandwich filled with Shippam’s “classic” beef spread.Perhaps lockdown has reminded us of family le back when restaurants were solely a treat, takeaways non-existent and we cooked most nights at home before gathering in front of the TV to watch, say, Mike Yarwood. A time when we busied ourselves with playing board games, doing craft activities and reading books during long periods of quiet contemplation with little  to do. And so, consequently, we have gravitated towards the nostalgic food brands that remind us of that time.Though it has to be said that The Bloke’s Heinz Mushroom And Bacon Toast Topper he purchased back in  is a step too far and remains untouched.He was stopped by Border Force teams.Either that or, just like the rest of us, he hired it for an hour and, a few minutes in, drted aimlessly after becoming paralysed with boredom.ONLINE dating frauds have soared by  per cent as con artists exploit loneliness in lockdown then ask to borrow money.The most vulnerable targets were women aged  to .With this in mind, here is my cut-out-and-keep guide to hopefully minimise the chances of this happening to you. If he tells you he’s a spy then he almost certainly isn’t.If he says he’s an airline pilot, only believe it when you see him sitting in a cockpit in full unorm.If he claims all his money is “stuck in Panama”, he’s penniless and after your cash.And finally,he goes incommunicado for several days and claims his phone broke, he’s probably been away with his we and four kids.You have been warned.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As long as they are working from home, they are contributing to this country’s problems in three separate ways. The first, and in some ways the most obvious, is that the services they provide are not as good as they should be. I remember fondly that when I was Immigration minister ten years ago, the Passport Service, which in its time had been a national disgrace, won awards for being a model public service.It was quick, flexible and customer friendly.All that has been thrown away under lockdown.There are no appointments in person any more, and I have seen reports that some passports are taking  days to be issued. More than a million passports have expired since March, soyou want to venture abroad next month you may have to be very lucky.If travelling is dficult, driving is not much easier.Anyonewho needs to renew a driving licence is stuck in a long and growing queue.At the other end of the age range, taking your driving test means waiting weeks or months. None of this is good enough in a country aching to get back to normal.The second reason why civil servants should be back at their desks as long as it is safe is that they are often the economic heartbeat of parts of our big cities.Whitehall in London is the most obvious example, but in other cities the public sector is also hugely important for economic activity.Shops, pubs and sandwich bars are open again buttheir customers are miles away they may as well shut their doors once more.As the unlocking has progressed, every MP has been lobbied hard by the sectors who have felt left behind.Gradually the second wave businesses — the nail bars and gyms — are getting their way. But so many of them rely on their location to succeed, and that location works because there are people whose offices are nearby.Empty offices are a death knell for nearby businesses. Footfall is key.The third reason is the most subtle, but perhaps the most important. It is that Government offices need to set an example to the rest of the country.If a private sector employee is wondering whether toto the office, and a neighbour who works for the Government is cheerfully planning to work from home indefinitely, the obvious question arises: “Why should I start commuting again ”Partly for reasons of safety and partly for reasons of convenience, many people have found working from home suits them.This is especially true over the summer, whenyou have a garden it is better to be there two minutes after you stop work than in a sweaty train.What this has come to mean, though, is second-class public services and the throttling of business.It is time for the civil service to set an example.It has had months to make its offices safe, and we have seen the ingenuity of pubs, restaurants and bars in doing the same in much less time, and sometimes with a clientele that will be much less disciplined.So safe offices should now be filling up again, with workers ending those backlogs and restoring the vitality to our cities.Above all they should be sending the signal that Britain can take big steps back towards normal le.A day in the office will mean our streets and shops come back to le.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More than , babies are thought to lack legal status because parents couldn’t register their births. And hotly anticipated family holidays have had to be cancelled because of worries over passport delays.Yesterday, Boris Johnson and his cabinet met in person for the first time in months to set an example that it’s safe to go back to work. But civil servants are still nowhere to be seen.They need to get all hands back on deck and be thankful that, unlike countless others, they still have jobs to go back to.PUBS and restaurants might be open again, but their problems are far from over.As head of the National Time Out campaign Jonathan Downey explains, hundreds of small businesses are closing their doors for the last time just as punters cautiously start to .Why  Because despite being forbidden from making money during lockdown, publicans and bar owners are now expected to cough up their rental payments — ­in full — to their landlords.We know there’s no quick fix. And Chancellor Rishi Sunak has already been incredibly generous to the hospitality industry.But pub, restaurant and cafe owners are the beating heart of this country.They provide work for thousands and keep millions more cheerful.If they put their heads together, surely banks, landlords and the Government can find a way to give these powerhouse employers a break while they get back on their feet.A DAMNING report makes it crystal clear that Russia is a real, hostile and active threat to Britain and its interests.The long-awaited document stretches to -odd pages, but the bottom line is this: The UK underestimated the threat from the Kremlin, and is still playing catch-up.From now on, our Government must be twice as vigilant in defending Brits from both shameless cyber attacks and insidious influence campaigns.A rogue state which murders Brits on British soil has no place in this country.NEWS that eight in ten of us plan to holiday in the UK this year is music to our ears.It looks likely the estimated £billion boost for the economy will be injected straight into rural areas and coastal towns — the places that need it most.Fingers crossed the lovely weather holds!GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You must vote Leave in that referendum.”I said to him: “Excuse me, sorry for asking, but are you a Russian ”He looked aghast and said: “Nyet! Why would you think that ”And I said: “Because you speak funny, you have borscht on your tie and you’re glowing, in a radioactive manner, slightly.”He went off around the pub saying the same thing to everyone . Later, I saw him with a bottle of vodka in one hand doing that dance where you crouch down and kick your legs out and shout “ha!” every so often. I wandered up. “Are you SURE you’re not a Russian ”There’s vodka dribbling down his chin and he smells of piroshki dumplings and isotopes. “Nyet! I am Englyishman. My name is Jyohn Smeeth.Definitely not Russian, definitely not KGB, my frent.”“Oh, OK,” I said, “No worries, good night.”“Dosvedanya, toich,” he replied.OK, that didn’t quite happen. But the remainers have got it into their heads that something like it did. We all voted Leave because the Russians interfered in our referendum. Meddled with our democratic process. Which is why we should stop leaving and have another vote.The allegation is that the Russkies tried to persuade us to vote leave by spreading  news around.What  news was that  That the European Union is an authoritarian bureaucracy run by pygmies from Luxembourg  That the EU wanted ever-closer political control over our country That we spent enormous sums of money keeping gibbering oafs like Jean Claude Juncker in office, while subsidising the useless states of Europe I don’t knowspecial agents Ivan and Dmitri were putting that stuff around, but I was well aware of the fact long beforethey were.Is there anything anyone can point to which suggests that the Russkies had an effect  There’s an allegation that they tried to ensure that the Scots voted for independence from the UK. And we should all vote for Jeremy Corbyn in the  election. Not hugely successful meddling operations, then, were they The thing about the alleged Brexit meddling is that it plays into the same narrative the remainers have been peddling for four years. We were all thick, us leavers. We voted Leave because we were DUPED. First by Boris and Nigel Farage. And now by the devilish Russians. Too dense to understand we were being conned, we voted Leave.Looking at the EU today, I’ve never been happier that we voted to get the hell out, incidentally.I have no doubt the Russians meddle in our affairs. I very much hope our own cyber spies are doing the same thing to them. I know the CIA is up to all sorts of tricks.Russia is not a very pleasant country right now and we should complain when it crosses the line — which it does, every month or so. But the idea that it had a decisive effect in our Brexit referendum is an insult to all those of us who thought long and hard and then voted Leave.The remainers can’t get over that we did so. They cannot bear to be defied. Tough. It wasn’t the Russians wot won it. It was us, the ordinary people of this fine country.And we’re still very glad we did.COVID has been good for some people. A lot of better- off people have been able to save loads of money, for example. And they don’t come much better off than the boss of Amazon, Jeff Bezos.Jeff has seen his income rise by a very agreeable £billion. That’s kind of enough money to buy France. So how about this, Jeffrey How about you get your company to pay the right amount of income tax in countries where you make so much money, such as the UK Last year Amazon did £billion worth of business in the UK – and paid £million in tax. That’s a tax rate, then, of two per cent.Not right, is it GOB on a very strange stick Janet Street Porter has been screeching about men. Again.She was having a go at Prince Andrew. Well, fair enough. The bloke is neither use nor ornament. And may soon be up to his neck in legal problems.I agree with the first part of what the toothy old harridan had to say. “Prince Andrew has no skills, no mates and no redeeming features.”Yup, largely agree, pet. But then she went on: “And so many modern middle-agedblokes are like that. That’s why women have drinks parties with their mates on Zoom, binge watch Netflix . . . and only laugh when they’re talking to gay men or their girlfriends.”She ended up by saying that men were becoming “redundant”.Can you imagine the outrageI had a go at a spectacularly useless woman – Janet Street Porter, for example.And then said most women were like her and that women in general are becoming redundant Ooh, there’d be howls of outrage.A LECTURER who said Jewish people had high intelligence has been sacked.Stephen Lamonby also said that Germans were good at engineering. For this – expelled. No job any more.Here’s the thing. Jewish people make up . per cent of the world’s population. And  per cent of Nobel Prize winners, like Bob Dylan, pictured.Countless studies have been done which show that Ashkenazi Jews have what one researcher, called, “the primo gene”. A high intellect. And Germans – well, they have been good at engineering, haven’t they Engineering Daily ranked countries in order of their prow-ess in the field. Germany came top. The magazine said: “Germany has long stood the test of time to emerge as a champion in the engineering field, reputed for its technical universities, internships and perhaps a culture and an economy that rewards engineering skills with both prestige and career growth.”Telling the truth, then, can now cost you your job. This moronic terror of the truth now infests most of our institutions. It has to stop.DAVID and Mary Sheldon took their newborn baby boy to the register office.And then got very upset. The registrar complained about their choice of name for the kid. Said it might cause him problems getting a job, later on.The Sheldons were very angry, but eventually got their way. The name they chose for their son  Lucer. Yep, that’s right, the Prince of Darkness. The parents said Lucer meant “bringer of light”.And while technically they might be right, it also means “that nasty, scaly, red b who lives in Hell”.A spokesman for Satan said yesterday: “I’m delighted by the Sheldons’ choice of name for their child. Lucer is a much maligned and misunderstood entity.“We will keep a close eye on the little mite and ensure that one day he rules the world, ha ha ha ha ha . . . ”I WAS sitting in a restaurant up here on Teesside. First meal out since lockdown. Large bloke comes in wearing a face mask. Uses the hand sanitiser by the door.Sits down, very carefully keeping his distance from everyone . He orders a double chicken parmo.For those of you not from Teesside, here’s what a parmo, pictured, is. A breast of chicken hammered flat. Then coated in bread- crumbs and deep fried. Then smothered in creamy bechamel sauce. And then with loads of Red Leicester on top of that.You eat it with chips and it’s , calories. He ordered a DOUBLE.You could almost hear his heart saying to him: “Look mate. Speaking on behalf of all of your bodily organs. We’d much rather you got Covid than ate that.“I think we can cope with Covid. But that thing is going to finish you off.”SPAIN has seen a big rise in Covid cases. Yup, amigo, it’s the dreaded “second spike” we’ve all been worried about.But people from the UK can still travel to Spain unhindered. And Spaniards can travel here without restriction.The Government says it will look at inidual countries and,need be, take them off the “air-bridge” list. Here’s my suggestion, Boris. Do it NOW.Quarantine for everyone arriving from Spain. Don’t make the same mistake you made in March. Back then there were NO restrictions on people from Covid hotspots – .million people arrived here up until lockdown.And that’s why we have one of the worst virus death rates in the world. Be quicker off the mark, Boris. Keep us safe.THE BBC will not rest until all the statues of Winston Churchill are torn down and his memory besmirched.Earlier this week the corporation broadcast a semi-literate tirade of abuse about Churchill’s “racism” and supposed brutality towards Indians.It was by a woman called Yogita Limaye. There was no discussion about the matter. Churchill was a racist, and that’s that. Also he caused the deaths of three million people in Bengal through a famine in .As it happens, the famine was caused by a tropical cyclone. These pieces were not “news” and so should not have been on The Ten O’Clock News. Andthey were to appear anywhere they should have been balanced. They were not balanced.Another case of the BBC virtue- signalling its wokeness.

But the pandemic worsened and HMS Bubble restrictions were imposed.They have enjoyed being side by side again and exercised together with only a handful of staff disturbing their peace.But the Queen has continued to work and received her red boxes containing official documents from the Government.And royal sources have described how her spirits were buoyed by last week’s wedding of her granddaughter Beatrice, , and property developer Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, , which was the kind of close-knit affair the monarch has always enjoyed.  It was the first time she had seen members of her family since March. Now aides are hastily trying to arrange more family reunions when the Duke and the Queen extend their time together for their annual summer stay at Balmoral in Scotland next month.With Harry and Meghan in LA and Andrew facing questions over Epstein, sources revealed the Queen has also taken great pride in William and Kate spearheading the fam- ily’s res- ponse to the Covid crisis.The “Iron Duke” — who spent four nights in hospital over Christmas as a precautionary measure for what Palace officials called a “pre-existing condition” — is delighted to be leading from the front.Invigorated by isolation, he looked back to his best in photos at Beatrice and Edo’s surprise wedding at All Saints Chapel in Windsor Great Park.Then he briefly stepped out of retirement on Wednesday to hand over his role as Commander-in-Chief of The Rles regiment to the Duchess of Cornwall.And he surprised everyone by walking down four steps and making a wisecrack to LCpl Colin Streetin.He asked the soldierhe was keeping fit and they both had a chuckle when bugler Colin replied: “Are you trying to say I am fat ” It is the sort of cheeky humour that Philip has become associated with during his many decades of public service.The duke was a dashing naval captain when he met the young Princess Elizabeth before the Second World War.They traded letters during the conflict and smitten Philip kept a photo of the future Queen.Philip and Elizabeth married in November  at Westminster Abbey. The duke gave up his Navy career when Elizabeth was crowned in .At her coronation, he pledged to “become your liege man of le and limb”. But he reportedly struggled to play second fiddle and was accused of affairs during their fledgling marriage, which have never been proven.A storyline In TV drama The Crown, featuring Philip having a fling with a Russian ballet dancer, was dismissed as fiction.At the couple’s th wedding anniversary in , the Queen said: “He has, quite simply, been my strength and my stay all these years.”After the duke retired three years ago, having clocked up , solo engagements since , the Queen spent weekdays at Buckingham Palace with a heavy workload before spending weekends on her own at Windsor Castle.Insiders say the duke was happy reading, painting and staying active and regularly spoke with the Queen on the telephone. Dickie Arbiter, former Buckingham Palace spokesman, said: “They get on very well. He has been at Sandringham becausehe stays in London and Windsor there is not a lot for him to do.”But after their Balmoral break they will have spent seven months by each other’s side — and aides are now working to keep them together.Traditionally at their Scottish home the Queen and Prince Philip have been hands-on and famously in charge of a family barbecue.The couple also welcome friends and family to the estate, although this year meetings will take place outdoors.They will travel together with a new HMS Bubble of up to  loyal staff.And no doubt the Queen and Prince Philip will be looking forward to spending as much time together as they can.Her Majesty and Prince Philip looked delighted and relaxed when photographed a socially-distanced gap from Beatrice and Edo last Friday.Their surprise wedding was only the second occasion the Queen had mixed with people outside her HMS Bubble.It signalled a carefully arranged end to her four-month-long isolation at Windsor Castle.The intimate and private ceremony had between  and  guests, allowing the Queen to see her family for the first time since March.Without the pomp and fanfare of previous royal weddings, which had taken months and years to arrange, there was very little stress involved.Instead, the Queen and duke, aided by staff, made themselves look immaculate and were chauffeur-driven the three miles to All Saints Chapel.Spending only  minutes at the Covid-secure ceremony meant they had enough time to see their granddaughter marry and greet sorely-missed family, including scandal-hit Prince Andrew.Beatrice and Edo also cheered the Queen by picking a date and chapel where she could attend before heading off to Balmoral next month.If the wedding had been much later then preparations for the August trip to the Scottish Highlands would be in full swing.And it meant she could still be back at Windsor Castle in time to hand a knighthood to Captain Tom Moore.Aides believe it was an easing back into engagements and social le for the Queen and duke.Plans are now under way to attempt more family reunions at Balmoral.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She told BBC Breakfast: We dont want to see members of the public accosted for not wearing a face mask. The Governments website says: Some people may feel more comfortable showing something that says they do not have to wear a face covering.This could be in the form of an exemption card, badge or even a home-made sign.This is a personal choice, and is not necessary in law.Disability charity Scope has warned people with disabilities could be abused for not wearing masks once they were made mandatory - and some campaigners brought out unofficial exemption cards.

Its been a very, very nasty thing for the human race and I think that by the middle of next year, we will be well on the way past it.Mr Johnson said there were gaps in the understanding about the deadly virus during the early stages.But he claimed his administration introduced lockdown at the right time, arguing he stuck like glue to the advice of experts.Speaking to BBC News, the PM said: Maybe there were things we could have done dferently, and of course there will be time to understand what exactly we could have done, or done dferently.He has promised an inquiry into the approach to dealing with Covid- and said there would be a time for questions about the UKs death rate.We didnt understandin the way that we would have liked in the first few weeks and months, he said.And I think probably, the single thing that we didnt see at the beginning was the extent to which it was being transmitted asymptomatically from person to person.I think its fair to say that there are things that we need to learn about how we handled it in the early stages... there will be plenty of opportunities to learn the lessons of what happened.Labour said the Prime Minister had finally admitted the Government had mishandled its response to the coronavirus.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: This finally puts to bed the Prime Ministers previous claim his Government took the right decisions at the right time.It was too slow to acknowledge the threat of the virus, too slow to enter lockdown and too slow to take this crisis seriously.Mr Johnson conceded that Britain was vulnerable to a second wave of coronavirus in the winter but looked to assure the public that action was being taken.We can see whats happening in other countries - I wont name them - but you can see the resurgence thats happening. We know that were vulnerable there, he said.So thats why were getting on now with our preparations for the winter... a massive flu vaccination programme, stockpiling PPE, making sure that we ramp up test and trace, and making sure that people get testedthey have symptoms.  The warning comes only a week after Mr Johnson said he hoped the UK would be able to get back to normal by Christmas - and social distancing could be dropped to let family hug over the festive season. But today he watered down hopes for a packed-in family Christmas saying he would not put a date on when social distancing can end.

Be sure to jump in the shower as soon as you get home and pop your workout clothing straight in the washing.It will have been a while since you were at the gym and a lot will have changed.The experts at BioFreeze add: Be sure to have a look around as soon as you arrive to get to know where everything now is to prevent wandering around aimlessly.Also, be sure to locate all cleaning products upon entering the gym so you know where to go, what’s available and what to use. If you’re not sure, the staff within the gym will be more than happy to help.Listening to your breathing will be key as you start going to the gym again.Everyone sweats and pants within the gym, that’s a given – but now is the best time to learn to get your breathing under control. Not only will it help to reduce contamination within the air, it will also allow you to have a more targeted and controlled workout. In through your nose, out through your mouth. Make deep, small breaths so that you don’t open your mouth wide when breathing out and aim your face downwards, where safe to do so, instead of out into the rest of the gym.Classes aren’t for everyone – many prefer weight sessions or working out alone within the gym – but classes are going to be one of the safest spots within gyms when they reopen. In its guidelines, the government states that gyms need to limit the number of people using facilities at one time. So class sizes will be reduced to allow for adequate workout space and they will also have their own equipment.It means that when the gym is busy, you know that you’ll not only get a good workout but also be using the relevant equipment to aid you.It’s not uncommon to have people standing nearby while you’re working out in the gym, by way of saying they’re next in line for the equipment that you’re working on. This isn’t going to be possible for the foreseeable future, with social distancing guidelines recommending a distance of between  to  metres. Instead of lingering, waiting for a machine or piece of equipment to become free, look around and see what  might be free that you can work with.Everyone is sweating and panting in the gym, and many carry their own towels – both to wipe themselves down and to wipe equipment down with. Your towel should only be used on your person. Be sure to use separate items to clean down any equipment and machinery after use such as anti-bac wipes or towel. And, of course, be sure to dispose of them after each and every use.Gyms have been urged to provide adequate hand sanitising stations and have also been asked to employ one way systems so people can navigate around the gym with ease.The guidance adds: Customers and staff should be encouraged to shower and change at home wherever possible, although changing rooms will be available.Each fitness centre will have slightly dferent measures in place, so do check what your local gym has planned.While workers will be cleaning equipment throughout the day, some gyms will be asking its members to also sanitise gear after using it.Energie Gym is one centre that has set out clear markings around equipment.Green and white tape marks where people can stand and green dots also represent where you are able to work out.PureGym is also one of the fitness chains that has asked its members to do just that.It has now released guidance about how to clean cardio machines and weights after using them.It includes focus on cleaning the main touch points, such as handles, seats and buttons you press for the machines.Youll also be asked to wait until the equipment is fully dry before using it.PureGym added it will be changing the layout of their gyms and equipment to allow for social distancing.There will be a deep clean each night.Some of its gyms will also be capped, meaning there will be a limit on the number of members in the gym at any one time.As part of measures to protect people, other chains have installed sneeze screens around gym equipment.While many peopleto the gym today, experts have warned that its important not to over exert yourself after having time away.Ross Mitchell, personal training tutor at Future Fit Training said its not just Covid precautions that you need to consider.A lot will want to go full bore the second they step foot inside, this is unwise. It’s going to be easy to do too much, and the price will be injury.In order to avoid injury he said you should start with small sets and apply mobility to cardio sessions.He added: Don’t be in a rush to ‘get back’ the fitness you may have lost, it willwith time consistency.Try and leave the gym feeling stronger than you entered it, build on this each session little by little.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was about  years old, said the woman, whose identity was disguised.She was with another teenage girl. They were speaking German. They were in the bakery section. I dont think anyone was with them.I realised after a few seconds who it could be but by then it was too late. Im certain of what I saw.The woman said she saw her three years ago, but did not report the alleged sighting at the time.She alerted police last month after Christian B was named as a suspect and she recognised a picture of his distinctive yellow and white camper van which was released by police.The woman said she had reported what she had seen to the McCann family lawyer Rogerio Alves and was waiting for him and police to formally contact her.By law CCTV is erased in Portugal after a month but Maria said:I remember seeing the yellow and white van in the parking lot.Maria told the show she had decided to speak out after learning Christian B had been involved in a robbery close by with a female accomplice who was also said to be German.She said she regularly spent her holidays in that part of the Algarve coast and can speak German.Christian B is currently serving  months in a German prison for drugs trafficking but also has convictions for rape and child abuse.He was convicted of raping a  year old American woman in  just a few minutes walk from where Maddie vanished but is appealing the conviction at the European Court of Justice on a technicality.Mr Alves has said he fears the authorities have just  months to nail the suspect due to a -year time limit on prosecutions in Portugal.Since Madeleine vanished, there have been nearly , reported sightings in  countries across the world, from Canada to New Zealand.Madeleines parents are aware of the alleged sighting and their spokesman Clarence Mitchell said: Anyone who has any credible information regarding Madeleine must give it to the police, whether they are in Portugal, the UK or Germany.In this case, the information has been given to the Policia Judiciaria and its now down to the authorities to establishtheres any truth in it.In the absence of incontrovertible evidence that the worst may have happened to Madeleine, Kate and Gerry will never give up hoping that their daughter may still be alive.“They continue to have every faith in the British police and the work of Operation Grange.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But no one’s paying the slightest bit of attention.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesHand sanitiser  That’s what homeless people drink, isn’t it People roar up to me all the time, flinging their arms round my shoulders and asking for a selfie. And they look genuinely perplexed when I ask them politely to back up a bit.At the TV studios where I’m working, there’s a one-way system that’s not being used, electronic ­temper- ature checks that are covered in cobwebs and endless signs telling people to keep apart. Which no one can read because of the huddle they’re in.At breakfast in the hotel where I’m staying, no one’s wearing a mask and in the city’s restaurants it’s business as usual.The only slight change is that because so many are working from home, the girls have plenty of spare time to take off even more clothes than usual before going out.Face masks  Ha. You must be ­joking. They’re not wearing anything at all.The problem is that social distancing simply doesn’t work in the North, where people are naturally friendly. Asking a Manc to scuttle about with his head down and his eyes locked in the straight-ahead position is like asking a fish to tap-dance.They’re also a pretty sensible bunch. Did you know thatsomeone had the virus in March, and was killed last week by falling out of a tree, they are still chalked up as a “Covid death”  Well they do up here. They know that this pandemic is a wave that’s passed.In London and the South East, meanwhile, it’s a very dferent story. There are Covid Nazis at every turn, telling people to keep apart and everyone is happy to oblige.Face masks are everywhere and no one is punctual for their Zoom calls because they’ve just spent two hours washing their hands.There’s a simple reason for this. In London, no one has ever wanted to talk to their neighbour and now they have an excuse.The reaction to Covid is almost tailor-made for the capital. Because all the guidelines are basically giving people permission to do what they’ve always done.“What  No one is allowed to sit next to me on the Tube  Excellent.”On balance, I’ve got to say, I ­prefer it in Manchester.LAST autumn was the wettest for  years. The spring was the hottest and driest ever. And July is on course to be the coldest for  years.It seems that every single day a new weather record is broken, which suggests the climate is changing.Which makes me wonder. Why did no one see this coming Andthey did, why were they so quiet about it Yes, and now he’s the Democratic candidate in this year’s presidential elections.HAVING done Covid- vaccine tests on , ­volunteers, a team of ­British boffins in Oxford has announced that the initial results are “encouraging”.That’s pathetic. “Encouraging” is completely the wrong word. It’s what teachers write on a fat kid’s school report after he’s managed to come second to last in the  metres sack race.The fact is that Oxford is in a fight to develop this vaccine with an American biotech company, and you can be certain Hank won’t ever describe his progress as “encouraging”.He’s already said it’s “robust” and soon he’ll be saying his medicine “kicks ass” and that it’s “hammer time”. Evenit’s causing people’s penises to fall off.The British have always been good at understatement. I once saw survivors being interviewed after a tornado had ripped the heart out of a small town in Oklahoma in the US.The Americans were hysterical, sobbing and saying: “The wind speed was, like, , miles an hour and I saw God himself reach down and take our house.”Whereas a British man, visiting on business, said when the cameras were poked in his face that it had been “a trle breezy”.That was charming, but whoever develops a vaccine will bring billions into the country, so we don’t want charm. We want our scientists to develop an American gung-ho, up-and-at-’em attitude.They can start by dropping this “encouraging” nonsense and describing their results as “awesome”.This seemed odd, because fitting windows to a submarine is as daft as fitting a coffee machine to a duck.I therefore did some checking and it turns out they’re there so that when the sub is on the surface, the crew don’t have to go outside to see where they are going. Which means they won’t get cold.Diddums. And we thought these guys were tough.I’VE often wonderedit’s ­possible to put something into Google search engine and get no results at all.I’ve tried quite often with phrases like “Piers Morgan fans” or “Alicia Vikander ugly tree”.But I’ve never managed it.Well, this week I needed to attach a snow plough to the front of my tractor – don’t ask – and had no idea how it could be done.So I googled “Front linkage Lamborghini .R”.And there it was. “Your search did not match any ­documents”.WE learned this week that there’s been a  per cent surge in the sales of cassette tapes.Couple of points on that. First of all, why  The sound quality on a cassette is so bad that for many years I thought that the Bee Gees had done a song called Bald Headed Woman, that the Police had sung about Sue Lawley and that Desmond Dekker had been saying: “My ears are alight.”Point number two is: what happened to the massive collection of cassettes we all used to have in the Seventies They can’t all have ended up wrapped round single shoes on the motorway’s central reservation.That’ll give me something to do tonight, I guess.

It is by Jimmy McGovern, who wrote Cracker, Hillsborough and The Street.As part of our Time For Change campaign, Stuart Lawrence, brother of murdered teen Stephen Lawrence, saw a preview. He tells Alison Maloney his reaction, and his hopes for the future . . .ONE of the hardest things to do,  years on from my brother Stephen’s death, is to imagine what his le would have been likehe had lived.So watching the drama Anthony — which imagines the unlived le of murdered teenager Anthony Walker — was incredibly emotional for me.Like Stephen, Anthony was just  when he was killed in an unprovoked racist attack in . Like Stephen, he was a bright, ambitious young man from a quiet family who just wanted to go about their lives.Like Stephen, he wasn’t the aggressor. He was just trying to do a decent thing, walking his girlfriend and friend to the bus stop, when he was senselessly attacked and lost his le in a Liverpool park.The new BBC drama, written by Jimmy McGovern at the request of Anthony’s mother Gee Walker, starts six years after the horric attack and imagines Anthony as a lawyer, married with a daughter.From there it works backwards to the tragic day he was taken, on July ,  years ago, and the unusual structure makes it even more heart- wrenching because it shows the possibilities lost in that moment.I feel great respect for the family, who have been brave enough to look through that lens of what could have happenedAnthony was allowed another six years on this planet.People ask me what Stephen would be like now, at , and I find those questions hard because I don’t want to think about what could have been.It’s like tormenting yourself because you go down a path of possibilities that can never come true.Anthony had just done his A levels and wanted to become a civil rights lawyer when he died. Stephen wanted to be an architect.Would he have been a great architect  Would he have been a husband and father What would our relationship be like now Stephen was two years older than me and was a typical big brother — a great role model, great friend, and annoyingly good at everything.He set the bar high for me and I’m still trying to live up to that and be the best person I can possibly be. In turn, I try to be the same for my younger sister, Georgina.It’s heartbreaking that families have to experience the loss of a young le in their prime, when they’re just about to go off and make a dference in the world.But this drama sends an incredibly important message about what happens when a young le is lost.Anthony saves his best friend’s le, after finding him sleeping on the streets, and him not being there meant that that intervention wouldn’t have happened.And who knows what his daughter would have gone on to do, after seeing the great work that her father did  That’s what happens when a young le is snuffed out.You will never knowthat was the one person in the world who could have solved global warming, poverty, the world’s famine. You will never discover where that person’s journey would have taken them. By the time Anthony was killed,  years after Stephen, I had been teaching for two years and I had hoped that things were getting better.His death came as a massive shock, because it echoed so many characteristics of what happened to Stephen, so I was all too aware of the impact this would have on his family and siblings.It was a reminder that, while many mindsets had moved forward, some people’s attitudes hadn’t changed.I get a lot of hatred on social media, people saying that somehow we are using Stephen’s death for personal gain, but I always say to people, ‘Walk a mile in my shoes’.I would much rather not be talking about these issues, but have a normal le and still have my brother.When I want advice, I can go to my parents, but I should also be able to go to my older brother and I don’t have that.For me, that’s a massive gap in my le and leaves me with a sense of loneliness that never goes away. Right now,  years after Anthony’s death, racism is still as big a problem as it was then, with social media acting as a breeding ground.Just today, on my own feeds, there is abusive language, hysteria and  truths about my brother and who he was as a person.ON the evening of July , , Anthony Walker, his girlfriend Louise Thompson and cousin Marcus Binns were waiting to catch a bus in Huyton, Liverpool.After spotting them, Michael Barton, then , began hurling racist abuse so they walked away, to cut through a park to another bus stop.Fellow attacker Paul Taylor, then , told Barton he had “lost face” and the pair launched their vicious attack.Louise and Marcus ran for help but Anthony was fatally wounded when Taylor hit him in the head with an ice pick. He died in hospital a few hours later.In the days that followed, Barton, brother of footballer Joey, and Taylor fled to Amsterdam. Joey, then  and at Manchester City, issued appeals for them toand hand themselves in, calling the crime “horric” and “senseless”.He said he had not been brought up with his brother and his “side of the family” were “sickened” by the death of a “kind, decent young man”. He said in one plea to his brother: “Do this for the Walker family so they can mourn Anthony and because you know it is the right thing to do.”The killers flew back to the UK on August  and were arrested at Liverpool airport.In December  they were convicted of murder and sentenced to le, with a minimum of  years and eight months for Taylor and  years and eight months for Barton. Lord Justice Leveson said the cousins had perpetrated a “terrying ambush” and a “racist attack of a type poisonous to any civilised society”.Earlier this month, a -year-old was arrested for racially abusing Crystal Palace footballer Wilfried Zaha, so we need to get better at stamping this out.Education is a big part of it, and I have been calling for an element of citizenship, taught from reception to when schoolkids leave at , because with skills and knowledge they can really understand how they fit into the world we live in today. I also think we need to hold some adults to account because, as teachers, we can provide the education but they are more influenced by their parents and the adults who support them.So I can spend all day telling them the right thing to do but they go home and hear something .I am a father and,my nine-year-old son was a teenager, like most parents I would be fearful when he went out because the kne crime and violence out there is crazy.But I try to be as hopeful and open-minded as possible because,it’s all doom and gloom, what’s the point of it all  We might as well give up and say, ‘Our kids are always going to have to face this’.I believe we can make a dference over the next ten years. We’ve got to try to keep on pushing the narrative of equality for everyone because,we don’t, nothing will change.That’s why I took part in The Sun’s recent Time For Change QA, along with Anthony Joshua, Trevor Phillips, Patrick Hutchinson and Katharine Birbalsingh, because it’s an issue we need to keep discussing.The Black Lives Matter movement, after the death of George Floyd in the US, was a great way to start the conversation and, this time, it feels like it has a worldwide momentum, rather than being an isolated case in America or in the UK.Anthony, this powerful drama, is another way to add to the crucial conversation.As a family, through the Stephen Lawrence Foundation, we have tried to make Stephen’s legacy a change for the good.Yes, a terrible tragedy happened to us as a family but in light of that we have been able to go forth and change people’s minds and attitudes and provide le experiences, and opportunities.Similarly, Anthony’s mum Gee carries on her son’s legacy with the Anthony Walker Foundation.She visits schools and does work-shops to show people the implications of one rash moment in time and how it can affect you and your le, and other people’s lives as well.She spreads messages of racial harmony and I know she’s out there doing great work.I am a hopeful person because, without hope, we can never change what is wrong in society.There has to be a positive out of the negative because, otherwise, it’s just been a le lost and all the hurt and pain has been for nothing.In response, The Sun this month launched our Time For Change campaign with a  discussion on how to make a lasting dference.Our  was made up of figures from across public le, including Stuart, boxing champ Anthony Joshua, Black Lives Matter protest hero Patrick Hutchinson, “super head” Katharine Birbalsingh and Trevor Philips, ex-head of the Human Rights Commission.Ex-teacher Stuart now concentrates on the Stephen Lawrence Foundation, to use his brother’s legacy to promotion equality, ersity and education.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And, strangely, this tends to be dictated by how we are doing financially.“When there’s financial stability women tend to be happy within themselves and it shows in the shape of their bottom, which is generally flat and square.“When we fall on hard times — for example during recessions — women tend to focus on balance and symmetry, which means a full, round butt is desirable.”As far back as Ancient Greece, artists were obsessed with creating the perfect bum, often showing goddesses such as Aphrodite in the nude. Philosopher Aristole wrote that the sphere was “the perfect, first, most beautul form” — so it is perhaps no surprise that classical bottoms were round and symmetrical.Here we take a rear view of what made — and makes — the perfect butt.s: In the Victorian era a tiny waist and bigger hips were de rigueur, enhanced by the trend for corsets. Never mind that they risked fainting, damaging their bones and crushing their organsit meant getting the perfect protruding bottom.Fast forward to the s and there was an about-turn, with flatter, more athletic butts desirable.s: With film star Marilyn Monroe as the poster girl for the decade, women yearned for a voluptuous bum like the movie goddess. Post-war rationing ended and women embraced their sexy side, with dresses that pulled in at the waist and drew the eye to the bottom. Wide hips were celebrated for fertility, and the resulting baby boom shows how much that attribute was valued after the war.s: Fashion set the pace for the new bum ideal, with petite pixies such as Brit model Twiggy leading the way. Feminine curves were out and flat bottoms were in, to better pull off the decade’s androgynous chic. Drainpipe jeans and capri pants, popularised by movie legend Audrey Hepburn, wouldn’t contain a large bottom. No one wanted their bum to look big in these.s: Long legs and a small, pert bottom were the order of the day. Think Farrah Fawcett from TV’s Charlie’s Angels.Sam Amos adds: “The girl next door look was really popular and a heart- shaped bottom became fashionable. Women with this kind of bum were seen as being tough but sensitive, and men loved that combination.”s: It was the decade of the Green Goddess, fitness guru Diana Moran, and the start of the supermodel era with Cindy Crawford catwalking into our lives. The emphasis was on fitness. The Athena Tennis Girl poster embodied our lust for an athletic backside. Aerobics classes focusing on legs, bums and tums sprang up everywhere.s: The arrival of Girl Power icons the Spice Girls meant putting in the hard work at the gym to achieve those grabbable, but toned, glutes. And at cosmetic surgeries, women were requesting liposuction to remove fat from their bums and thighs. Dr Riccardo Frati, of Frati Cosmetic Surgery, said: “People wanted to remove the excess, localised fat without creating nice curves.”s: Pop princess Kylie Minogue launched the Millennium by Spinning Around in a pair of teeny gold lame hot pants, and a new era for butts dawned.There was a fascination with the “underbum”, the part above the thighs that became acceptable to flaunt.Then US singer Jenner Lopez got us thinking that bigger might just be better.s: J-Lo’s successor in the butt stakes was, of course, Kim Kardashian, with her ample, gravity-defying behind.As round as a basketball, the new bum shape was just as bouncy, and our growing attachment to Instagram meant we could swipe through endless pictures of women showing off theirs.No amount of squats could achieve this cartoon-like figure, not that we didn’t try. In gyms, we started lting weights and,all  failed, we turned to surgery.The Brazilian Butt Lt became a thing, taking fat from another part of the body to boost bottoms. By the end of the decade, surgeons were warning of the dangers of having such surgery abroad after a number of deaths.s: It’s time to be body positive, thank goodness. We’re embracing our natural shapes, whether that’s flat, small, round or large. We know perfection on Instagram is often created by good light, good make-up and filters.TV’s Love Island contestants might show us up in their barely there bikinis, but we’re also embracing plus-size models and stars who are proud of their curves, like the pop star Lizzo.Sun Fashion Editor Clemmie Fieldsend says: “Fashion is finally listening to women’s bodies and has embraced dferent figures. Round or heart-shaped bums can be celebrated and enhanced with waisted frocks, while high-waisted trousers give your bum a fuller look.“And there is hope for flat bums, these days jeans have clever stitching to contour your posterior to give the appearance of a rounder, peachy one.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It says: “While they both respected the hierarchy of the institution, it was dficult when they wanted to focus on a project and were told a more senior family member, be it William or Charles, had an initiative being announced at the same time so they’d have to just wait.”The Sussexes moaned they’d taken the monarchy to “new heights around the world” and were held back so they did not “eclipse” the family, it’s claimed.A friend of the couple described the old guard as “the vipers” — while a Palace staffer referred to Harry, , and Meghan, , as “the squeaky third wheel” of the family.The book also details how the bitter Sussexes are said to have been angry at being barred from setting up their own office at Windsor.They whined they were victims of a “merciless machine” of aides and courtiers steeped in tradition.The biographers quote Meghan astonishingly claiming: “I gave up my entire le for this family. I was willing to do whatever it takes. But here we are. It’s very sad.”She and Harry were bemused that other royals appeared jealous of their popularity, says the book.They also began to feel they lacked support within Buckingham Palace, it is claimed.The authors add: “The senior courtiers, whom Diana used to refer to as men in grey suits, were concerned that the global interest in, and popularity of, the Sussexes needed to be reined in.“In the short time since their fairytale wedding, they were already propelling the monarchy to new heights. As their popularity had grown so did their dficulty in understanding why so few inside the Palace were looking out for their interests. They were a major draw for the Royal Family.”The Sussexes’ team were even said to have compared online interest in them with that of Wills and Kate.They found they accounted for  per cent of Google searches linked to the former “Fab Four”. The authors claim: “The Sussexes had made the monarchy more relatable.”Yet Harry is said to have become “drained” with family politics.The authors add of Meghan and Kate: “The Duchesses struggled to move past the distant politeness of when they first met.“Their cordial but distant rapport was apparent when they appeared with each other.   The state of affairs between them was just an offshoot of the real matter at hand — the conflict between Harry and the institution. Harry likened it to standing in front of a firing squad.”Another source of anger came when the Sussexes were barred from establishing their own team in Windsor, separate from all others.The authors say: “Senior officials quickly ruled out that option.“For months the couple tried to air their frustrations but the conversation didn’t lead anywhere.”The Sun exclusively revealed their Megxit plans to spend more time in Canada in January.That led to the Sandringham ­summit with the Queen which ­formalised how the Sussexes would step down. The book claims Harry ­discussed the “need for change” with the Queen and Charles before the summit but was frustrated by the lack of movement.And it says they took the decision to become financially independent and “cut themselves off from access to the Sovereign Grant”. The book claims they wanted to see the Queen on theirto the UK on January , but were told she wasn’t available until January .Harry is also said to have grown frustrated at comments on online stories about the couple.The book says: “Harry is reported to have said, ‘It’s a sick part of the society we are living in today and no one is doing anything about it. Where’s the positivity. Why is everyone so miserable and angry ”He is said to have cemented his desire for a split after spending time on Vancouver Island over Christmas.The authors write: “Harry told a friend, ‘I don’t need that movie moment where we get out of a car and wave to hundreds of photographers before going into a building.’“It should just be about the work that’s happening inside. Let’s focus on what really matters.”The biography goes on to reveal that the “devastated” Queen agreed to the couple leaving but ruled out a ‘half-in, half-out’ solution. It says: “The most disappointing aspect was Harry being stripped of his honorary military appointments.“It was so unnecessary,” Meghan texted to a friend, says the book.At Westminster Abbey in March only Wills, Kate, Charles and Camilla were allowed to walk with the Queen — much to Harry’s frustration.The book says: “Harry spoke up, but the damage had been done.“To smooth things over the Cambridges agreed to take their seats at the same time, but appeared unhappy with this.“While Harry and Meghan greeted William and Kate, the Cambridges showed little response. William nodded, ignoring Meghan.”Harry, Meghan and baby Archie are now based at actor Tyler Perry’s £million Beverly Hills mansion.The book does claim it was “like old times” between Harry and the Queen at a meeting shortly before the Sussexes quit the UK.A source added: “It’s been made very clear they can come back whenever they want.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The order also applies to transport hubs such as railway stations and airports, with £ fines for those who do not comply.But restaurants, pubs, gyms, hairdressers, beauty salons, leisure centres, cinemas, concert halls and theatres are exempt.Staff members stood guard at the front door to McDonald’s restaurants, with a spokesperson for the fast-food giant saying the Government’s guidelines were clear and should be followed.The majority of people were abiding by the rules but there were reports on social media of arguments in supermarket aisles.Hapless former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was spotted inside a shop and a bank with no face covering in his Islington North constituency — but he was later seen walking out with a cup of coffee in a mask.Shoppers at Silverlink Shopping Park in Newcastle said they were determined to help control the virus by wearing masks. Dorothy Tooley, , of South Shields, South Tyneside, said: “They have worked in countries like New Zealand and we need to follow suit.”Photographer Cristina Licata, , of Basingstoke, Hants, was on her first trip to the shops in four months, adding: “I’ve been waiting for this rule to come in.”Judith Molloy, , from St Helens, who was shopping in Liverpool One, said: “This should have started from day one.”Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said shoppers who refuse to wear masks should be “shamed” into compliance.But John Apter, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, insisted shops must enforce the measures.He said: “This is a new way of living and I would urge retail outlets to play their part in making the rules crystal clear.“If you are not wearing a face covering, you are not coming in. Officers will be there to help storesneeded but only as a last resort. We simply do not have the resources.”Yet Tom Ironside, from the British Retail Consortium trade association, claimed: “Where the rules are not being followed, enforcement will be a matter for police.”As part of the guidance, staff in places where face coverings are required are encouraged to “take reasonable steps to p­romote compliance with the law”.But Costa Coffee was among rebel firms who said it would “not be challenging ­customers” not wearing masks.Sainsbury’s asked shoppers to continue “playing their part” but said its workers “will not be responsible for enforcing the rules”.  Asda also said it would “strongly encourage people to wear a face covering” but refused to ask non-wearers to leave.Tesco began selling face coverings at the entrance and Waitrose staff reminded customers of the requirement.Exemptions include children under , people with breathing problems and anyone who cannot put on, wear or remove a face covering because of a physical or mental illness or impairment or disability.The British Medical Association said the rules were “long overdue”.A recent study showed thatthe entire population wore face coverings that were only  per cent effective, it would bring a transmission R rate down from . to under . without the need for lockdowns.The law on face masks could be in place until at least January.

He said: One of the lessons I drew fromis the need for us all to be fitter and healthier. If we’re fitter and healthier by the way, we will also be happier. And heres the key thing,were fitter and healthier, andwe lose weight, well be better able not just to inidually withstand coronavirus, but well do a great deal to protect the NHS. Thats why well be bringing forward an obesity strategy.Under plans being finalised by ministers, junk food adverts could be banned online and before the pm watershed to stop kids getting hooked on unhealthy grub.Shops could also be barred from promoting unhealthy food and drink products in store as part of a drive to improve the health of the nation.He will unveil the Government’s new obesity strategy on Monday.Obesity is a major risk factor in people getting seriously ill from the virus, medical experts say.Speaking to Sky News this morning as he urged everyone to get the flu vaccine this winter to protect the NHS, the PM said: Im on the way, Ive lost about a stone and a bit.Primarily by eating less, but also by a lot of exercise.BORIS Johnson today admitted that the Government could have handled the coronavirus crisis dferentlySpeaking on the anniversary of becoming PM, he wouldnt be drawn on what mistakes had been made during his handling of it.He said in an interview with BBC News this evening: Maybe there were things we could have done dferently, as Ive said, and of course there will be time to understand what exactly we could have done, or done dferently.But what I think the public wants us to do now is to focus on getting the preparations ready for what, as I say, could be a resurgence of the virus this winter.And he added: When you look back at this crisis, everybody can see that this was something that was new, that we didnt understand in the way that we would have liked in the first few weeks and months.The single thing that we didnt see at the beginning was the extent to which it was being transmitted asymptomatically from person to person. That wasnt clear to us or to anybody.The PM stressed there would be plenty of time to look back at all the things that must be learned from the crisis.Last week he promised an independent inquiry into the virus, but didnt say when it would happen or who would lead it.The PM was asked about suggestions the Government may ban junk food adverts before the watershed, and said: Im not normally a believer in nannying... type of politics.Losing weight is, frankly, one of the ways that you can reduce your own risks from Covid.He didnt go into any more detail about what the new obesity strategy might involve.But earlier today Tim Rycroft, COO at the Food and Drink Federation, blasted the plans as a slap in the face for the industry.The Government is about to, it seems, deliver a slap in the face to the food industry which has worked so heroically over the past four months to keep the nation fed, at some considerable risk to itself.Its going ban promotions of food ten days before the Chancellor launches the biggest food promotion the country has ever seen.Its going to put enormous costs on the advertising industry and on broadcasters on a time where the economy is in quite a tenuous situation.The result of this will be higher prices for shoppers, less choice.And all of this to reduce our average intake per day by  calories.He said it was extraordinary the Government was still focused on the idea of a watershed, when the world was now digital and online. He also warned that prices could go uppromotions were curbed.He added: These promotions, help make food cheaper that’s an imp thing at the moment. The government’s figures show that the average family will spend £ more on their shoppingthere are no promotional discounts. Is that something we really want to do at the moment when people are so hard pressed John OConnell, chief executive of the TaxPayers Alliance, added: Hard-pressed hungry shoppers don’t need Boris piling on the pounds to their weekly food bill. Ministers are telling taxpayers to eat out to help out the economy, but also want to abolish the kind of price promotions which keep costs down and make everyday food affordable for millions. If it wants people to be out shopping, providing for their families and keeping the economy afloat, the government needs to stop this silly supermarket snobbery. Boris is said to have been persuaded by medical and nutritional advisers that tackling obesity is  per cent diet and  per cent exercise.  The radical plans contrast with the PM’s previous opposition to nanny state interventions but in May he said he had undergone a “damascene conversion” following his own brush with death after catching coronavirus, which disproportionately affects overweight men.He said he the coronavirus pandemic had convinced him that urgent action was needed to tackle Britain’s obesity crisis.But The Sun revealed last week that he had drawn a red line at fresh sugar taxes as he does not want to people to feel “bullied” into eating healthier.Instead he and Health Secretary Matt Hancock hope a ban on online adverts and pre-pm TV ads will change people’s shopping and eating habits.

It was meeting Meghan that emboldened him to take the step and turn his back on the family, according to authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand in new book Finding Freedom. An insider claimed Harry was left feeling like a spare part. They said: “Harry felt awkward as a plus one. They’d turn up at premieres and there was this sense that he felt a bit like a spare part. “Long before Meghan, he wanted to change things. Tensions between Harry and William reached breaking point in the build-up to the younger brotheraposs wedding, when the Duke of Cambridge is said to have asked him: Are you sure about this  And the Cambridges were not welcoming to Meghan when she arrived in Britain, it is claimed.  Things came to a head after his marriage to Meghan, when the couple felt pushed out by the Cambridges. William and Kate were content to let negative publicity go unchallenged, while Harry and Meghan wanted to respond to every negative headline, it is claimed. This caused a lot of stress for their advisors. As tensions grew, the Sussexes considered the extreme measure of breaking royal protocol to contact the Queen as tensions grew in the royal family, according to the book. An extract says Harry spoke to the Prince of Wales and the Queen about the need to change things before he left for Canada for six weeks at the end of last year.  The authors write: He felt at once used for their popularity, hounded by the press because of the publicaposs fascination with this new breed of royal couple, and disparaged back within the institutionaposs walls. While in Canada, the couple decided to step back as senior royals. Harry attempted to set a meeting with his grandmother at the start of January, but was told she was unavailable until the end of month. In the extract published in The Times, the authors write that as the couple flew back to the UK they toyed with the idea of driving straight from the terminal to see the Queen.

Under the new rules, exercise equipment will be spaced out and class sizes reduced to allow social distancing. Dance classes and exercise sessions are likely to have markings on the floor to show you where to stand. People will be encouraged to arrive in their kit and to travel home to shower afterwards, although showers will be available. Lockers are likely to be out of bounds and visitors should bring their own water as fountains will not be in use in many facilities.Some gyms are planning to take people’s temperatures at the door, with handwashing facilities and sanitiser to be provided. Customers should pre-book their sessions and pay in advance, and one-way systems will be in place to reduce contact between gym-goers. However masks will not be mandatory for those visiting the gym, unlike in shops, supermarkets and public transport where they must be worn.The exceptions to this are in Leicester, Luton and Blackburn - where gyms and indoor pools cannot reopen due to high local coronavirus rates.Here are nine ways gyms and swimming pools will look very dferent as they reopen on Saturday. . You should arrive in your sports kit - and go home sweaty  While showers and changing rooms are allowed to reopen, people are asked to - wherever possible - arrive in their sports kit. After playing, they should then in general avoid using the showers or changing roomspossible, and simply go home sweaty. This will reduce the risk of transmission in changing rooms. The guidance says changing rooms must be open for those with disabilities or special needs, and are likely to be needed after swimming. . There wonapost be as many lockers  Lockers will remain open in general, but some of them could be shut to ensure people space out. For example, gyms could ensure social distancing by limiting use to alternate lockers. Lockers should also be kept clean and clear of personal items where thataposs possible - and cleaned regularly when used. . You may need to book a time slot  Gyms will be told to limit the number of people they can have inside at any given time. Part of that suggestion is that inidual facilities use a booking system to make sure that gyms are not overcrowded. It would also provide a handy list to for contact tracerssome did later test positive for the virus. . There will be far fewer people  Gyms have been asked to reduce the number of people inside dramatically - with only one person per  metre squared in the facility. The same rule applies to space in a swimming pool. However, gyms will be allowed to include changing room space, and other indoor facilities like tennis courts, when calculating the number of people that will be allowed in. . Classes will be smaller Exercise class sizes are to be slashed in order to reduce the number of people coming into contact with one another. Another change will be increasing the amount of time between exercise classes. That will avoid people queuing outside classrooms and allow time to clean facilites like shared bikes and other equipment. And gyms should consider limiting the number of classes that rotating instructors teach, to minimise exposure. . Your dance class could be limited to within a line of tape  Temporary floor markings are recommended for dance and exercise studios. They would be used to mark out the required spacing per inidual while people jump up and down. . There will be one way systems Throughout the gym, expect to see one way systems to reduce the chance of exercisers bumping into one another. It might mean changes to peopleaposs exercise routine - but it might also be an incentive not to skip aposleg dayapos. . There will be less equipment, more spaced out  In order to reduce the number of surfaces, that could become contaminated, and make it easier to keep you distance from other gym users, you can expect to see fewer pieces of equipment and for it to be more spaced out. Equipment will also need to be regularly cleaned and wiped down. . No loud music - and you might be told to keep the noise down Venues have been told to take steps avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes - but is not limited to - refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission - particularly from aerosol and droplet transmission. So your spin class leader might be a bit less chatty. . Limits on the number of people in the pool at once  You can also expect a hard limit on the number of people allowed in a swimming pool at any one time. You may also see reduced opening hours to give increased time for cleaning. Swimming pools should restrict numbers to allow sqm per bather. Oh andyou want to use a flume you need to do it in a socially distanced manner. . There canapost be any steam rooms  Saunas and steam rooms should stay out of use for the time being as scientists have warned that the risk of transmission is unclear. Hydrotherapy pools are allowed, but capacity should be managed so as to take account of any special needs of the clients. Beauty, massage and physio services are also allowedthey follow separate guidelines. .

The little girlaposs mother then threw a glass of water over her distressed daughter, Swansea Crown Court heard. A judge said some of the treatment meted out to the youngster verged on sadistic. The abuse of the child was so disturbing that the incident was covertly filmed by a concerned neighbour. The court heard the incident took place in the garden of a house in the Swansea Valley in June . The partner of the girlaposs mother subjected the youngster to a torrent of shouting and screaming, including threatening to lock her in the freezer, before grabbing her by the ankles and holding her upside-down. During the incident the girlaposs mother threw water over the crying child. A neighbour of the couple was so alarmed by what was going on that they recorded some of the incident and later alerted the police. The couple - who cannot be named to protect the identity of the child - pleaded guilty to ill-treating a child when they appeared in the dock together. An earlier sentencing hearing had been adjourned after the judge requested a report into the psychological harm done to the child by the incident.  Karlia Lykourgou, for the male defendant, said the couple had been immature and young parents trying to cope and said her client was willing to engage with counselling or other help on offer to ensure there was no repeat. Lee Davies, on behalf of the female defendant, said his client now understood she should have tried to intervene straightaway and put to a stop to what was going on. He said the woman was trying to rebuild her relationship with her daughter and to regain her trust. Judge Paul Thomas QC said every parent has had the experience of dealing with a fractious child but what happened in the garden on the day in question had been bullying, hectoring, demeaning, and heartless behaviour which had verged on sadistic.  He said he thought the male defendant had been enjoying a power-kick in the way he had treated the child. Judge Thomas said that far from stopping what was going on, the female defendant had thrown water over the girl when it must have been apparent she was very distressed.

It is said relations between brothers Prince William and Prince Harry and their spouses grew so bitter that by March the couples were barely speaking. The book, Finding Freedom, claims the Cambridges and Sussexes hardly spoke at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey in March despite not having seen each other since January. The bookaposs authors, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, said: Although Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her. Mr Scobie told the Times: To purposefully snub your sister-in-law... I donapost think it left a great taste in the coupleaposs mouths. Finding Freedom, serialised by the Times and the Sunday Times, contains sensational new claims about how Meghan and Harryaposs relations with his family broke down, and how the Sussexes decided to quit le as senior royals. TV footage of the March  service showed the Cambridges and Sussexes exchanging an awkward hello as they took their seats. It was Meghan and Harryaposs last public royal duty before they quit, and the first time the couples had appeared in public together after Megxit was announced.  The Finding Freedom authors, accused of being cheerleaders for the Sussexes, describe a culture of increasing tension between the couple and other members of the Royal Family. They say the Sussexes felt their complaints were not taken seriously and believed other royal households were leaking stories about them to the press. There were just a handful of people working at the palace they could trust, the authors write. A friend of the coupleaposs referred to the old guard as aposthe vipersapos. Meanwhile, a frustrated palace staffer described the Sussexesapos team as aposthe squeaky third wheelapos of the palace. Harry and Meghan liked being in control of their narrative in the early days of their marriage, the authors say. But being told to operate under Buckingham Palaceaposs umbrella after splitting their household from the Cambridgesapos was a big disappointment to them. As their popularity had grown, so did Harry and Meghanaposs dficulty in understanding why so few inside the palace were looking out for their interests. They were a major draw for the Royal Family, the authors write.  The book says the Sussexes even considered breaking protocol by springing a surprise visit on the Queen when they believed they were being blocked from seeing the monarch. A spokesman for Harry and Meghan said the couple did not contribute to the book, but he did not deny the content of The Timesaposs extracts. The spokesman said: The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were not interviewed and did not contribute to Finding Freedom. This book is based on the authorsapos own experiences as members of the royal press corps and their own independent reporting.

New biography Finding Freedom will detail the breakdown between the so-called aposFab Fourapos - Harry, Meghan, William and Kate - with claims the Sussexes were frustrated at taking a aposbackseatapos to other royals. An extract from the book, as serialised in todayaposs Times, says: Increasingly Harry had grown frustrated that he and Meghan often took a back seat to other family members. While they both respected the hierarchy of the institution, it was dficult when they wanted to focus on a project and were told that a more senior ranking family member, be it Prince William or Prince Charles, had an initiative or tour being announced at the same time — so they would just have to wait. For months the couple tried to air these frustrations, but the conversations didn’t lead anywhere. Relations between the Sussexes and the Cambridges grew so bitter that by March the couples were barely speaking, the book goes on to claim. The foursome aposhardly spokeapos at the Commonwealth service at Westminster Abbey despite not having seen each other since January, the biography says. Authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand wrote: Although Meghan tried to make eye contact with Kate, the duchess barely acknowledged her. Mr Scobie told the Times: To purposefully snub your sister-in-law... I donapost think it left a great taste in the coupleaposs mouths. There are now fears the biography, which appears to sympathise with Meghan and Harryaposs frustrations, could make matters between the estranged royals even worse.  “There are buckets of bitterness, a source told The Sun. It will certainly not help relations with the Royal Family.  The biography - which Meghan and Harry say they did not contribute to - claims the couple felt they deserved bigger royal roles after the success of their Windsor wedding which was beamed to millions worldwide. The Sussexes felt their complaints were not taken seriously and believed other royal households were leaking stories about them to the press. There were just a handful of people working at the palace they could trust, the authors write. A friend of the coupleaposs referred to the old guard as aposthe vipersapos. Meanwhile, a frustrated palace staffer described the Sussexesapos team as aposthe squeaky third wheelapos of the palace. William and Harryaposs split has been described as the aposmost serious royal conflict for generationsapos by biographer Robert Lacey, the author behind another upcoming release aposBattle of Brothers: William and Harry - the Friendship and the Feudsapos. Laceyaposs book, which will be released in October, examines how the relationship breakdown fits into a historical context. Raised to be the closest of brothers, the last  months has seen a devastating breakdown of their once unbreakable bond, the synopsis says. Last October, the Duke of Sussex opened up to ITV News anchor Tom Bradby in the film Harry and Meghan : An African ­Adventure.Bradby said: “It has been a year of big change, with all the complications that brings. This includes the decision to split his office off from that of his brother, to whom he has always been close.” The news presenter then asked about the truth to ­speculation of a rt. Harry said: “Part of this role and part of this job and this family being under the pressure that it’s under ­inevitably, you know, stuff happens. “But look, we’re brothers. We’ll always be brothers. We’re certainly on dferent paths at the moment but I will always be there for him and as I know he’ll always be there for me. “You know, we don’t see each other as much as we, as much as we used to because we’re so busy. But, I love him dearly and, you know, the majority of the stuff is created out of nothing. Just as I said, as brothers, you know, you have good days, you have bad days.” "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan tearfully said gave up","story":"NewsMeghan tearfully said she gave up her entire le for royal family biography claimsExcerpts from a bombshell new biography claim Meghan Markle said she was \"willing to do whatever it takes\" to make things work with the RoyalsShareCommentsByBenjamin Cooper:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video meghan-markle-self-doubt-makes-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,evergreenArticle:,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,IASVisRestrictToGeo:UK-IE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,tcfVersionOne:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,swipeNavigation:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,mpulse.enabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,appNexusVideoPrebidEnabled:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news meghan-tearfully-said-gave-up-\"\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

An excerpt from Finding Freedom says the Duchess of Sussex made the comment in March, around the time of the tumultuous split from the Firm. The book covers the period known as Megxit, when Meghan and husband Harry confirmed they would be leaving the UK to live overseas. Harry and Meghan liked being in control of their narrative in the early days of their marriage, the authors say in excerpts published in the Times today. But being told to operate under Buckingham Palaceaposs umbrella after splitting their household from the Cambridges was a big disappointment to them. As their popularity had grown, so did Harry and Meghanaposs dficulty in understanding why so few inside the palace were looking out for their interests. They were a major draw for the royal family, the authors write. Harry and Meghanaposs relationship became public in late , with his future we leaving her acting career and lestyle blog the next year. Meghan moved to the UK in , leaving behind her beloved mother Doria Ragland as well as other family and friends, and the couple were married the following May. According to Finding Freedom, she was acutely aware of the sacrices she made to be with Harry. ... they still wanted to carry out their duties for the Queen, the authors write. That was the one thing that they did not want to end — not just because of Harry’s love and respect for his grandmother, but also because Meghan felt shehad given up so much to take her le down a path of service to the monarchy. She didn’t quit when she signed up for a task.The media speculated that Meghan was behind the decision for the couple to step back, but few knew how much she sacriced to try to make it work. As Meghan tearfully told a friend in March: “I gave up my entire le for this family. I was willing to do whatever it takes. But here we are. It’s very sad.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper home delivery offer","story":"NewsGet The Mirror delivered free to your door for six weeksIts packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByAlison PhillipsDaily Mirror Editor:,  MAR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex sensationally quit the royal family earlier this year. But there were warnings signs of their shock move and the Queen knew something was amiss before Christmas, according to a report this evening.The revelations come on the eve of a bombshell biography of the couple called aposFinding Freedomapos which is set to be serialized this weekend. A new report claims that in November  Her Majesty had not heard whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their newborn son Archie would be spending Christmas at Sandringham and she decided to give them a call at Frogmore Cottage.The decision broke with tradition as ordinarily it is for the younger Royals to phone “Granny”.But the -year-old wanted to get to the bottom of what was happening after hearing tales of apostantrumsapos ever since the couple got married at Windsor Castle in , reports The .  However, the Queen did not get the answer she wanted and instead days later she learnt the couple were not coming for Christmas but on a six-week sabbatical to Canada to “work out their future”.It was during this time they reportedly plotted their way out of the Royal Family and within weeks, on January , it was announced that Harry and Meghan would be taking a new direction as royals. While their decision had been made, Harry reportedly wanted to speak with The Queen and Prince Charles - his grandmother and father - on the phone but officials persudaded him instead to write to them.  Extracts from new biography Finding Freedom, by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, are expected to reveal - Harry’s anger predominantly lay with what his mother famously described as the palace’s “men in grey suits” - rather than his own royal relatives. A source said: The palace approach would always be - how did we do it last time  He wanted to do things dferently and I think Meghan was the catalyst for him but also gave him the confidence which he lacked to change things.” "},{"url":null,"title":"neighbour blocks rivals car scaffolding","story":"NewsNeighbour blocks rivals car in with scaffolding as parking row eruptsInspector Darren Taylor, of Mid Sussex Police, who shared pictures of the incident, said he had never before seen a parking row escalate to the point where someone used scaffolding to block a vehicleShareCommentsByChris DyerMatthew Dresch:,  JUL NewsA neighbour blocked in a car with scaffolding over a parking dispute \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

During the episode, viewers are taken on a roller coaster ride as they watch the project cause a great amount of stress for all those involved - and one of the builders tragically dies before he can see the completed efforts of his labour. Harry and Briony Anscombe were the couple with visions of creating a structure similar to A James Speyeraposs Ben Rose House featured in Ferris Bueller - despite never having seen the actual house before. Presenter Kevin McCloud spent time with the pair, learning how they had moved out of London  months earlier and now wanted to set down their roots in Cornwall and build a dream pad. The project, which took place on the site of a former dairy farm, ended up taking longer than theyaposd hoped and the team ended up taking a number of gambles. One big blow came early on in the episode when McCloud revealed that their budget of £, wouldnapost give them a proper replica of the film house - theyaposd need to double their moneythat was what they truly wanted.  Despite this, Harry and builders Ken and Mark, decided they would carry on, making some changes to the plan, meaning the end result wouldnapost be quite the same as the house which a Ferrari famously crashed through the windows of. However the set backs kept on coming, with the Beast from the East causing them trouble and a wrong measurement setting their schedule back weeks. But the worst was yet to happen. As the construction work continued, the team arrived on site one morning to discover that Ken Pearce, one of the builders, had died suddenly in his sleep. He was always so patient with us, we asked stupid questions every day and he’d put up with it and teach us in his charming Cornish way, said Harry. He wasnapost just a builder he was a friend of the family too.  Fourteen months after they started, the house, called Natural Bridges, was completed and a memorial stone with the words Built , Ken Pearce was installed outside the property as a tribute to their friend. The finished build featured some noticeable dferences from the Ferris Bueller house - the most obvious of which is that it is made from less glass and instead has more walls in the form of Siberian larch cladding. Itaposs also bigger than the movie home. The entire project set the couple back £, in the end, but they definitely thought it was worth it. Speaking about the house, Harry said: Speyer was pure glass and perhaps a bit impractical, but it inspired us, and this is our version.

Jasmine Nur, , was watching Zobiyah, four, enjoy a packet of Nutella  Go, as they were doing their food shopping. The stay-at-home mum, from Auckland, New Zealand, didn’t think much of it and continued browsing the supermarket. However, while she was wiping her daughteraposs face she noticed she was breaking out in hives which she said appeared in places that were in direct contact with the Nutella chocolate. Jasmine panicked and immediately rushed Zobiyah to hospital where a nurse gave her a fast dose of antihistamine to reduce the swelling. However, the youngster would go on to suffer allergic reactions from other foods and steroid creams, as well as rashes and eczema. The eczema became so severe, strangers made cruel assumptions about Jasmineaposs parenting. Recalling the incident that happened in , Jasmine said: We were out grocery shopping and she happened to have found a Nutella  Go packet. “She opened it up and immediately started munching away. I didnapost think anything of it. I continued doing my shopping and got back to the car. “As I started wiping her face, thataposs when I noticed she started to get hives whilst I was wiping away. They were literally appearing in all the places that the Nutella touched. Zobiyah was kept under observation at hospital for a number of hours before being given her prescription then sent home. But a week later, Zobiyah started developing severe rashes around her eyes and hands. Jasmine didn’t know what to do and after a few days, Zobiyah started to get feverish and her rashes became infected. Thinking she had chicken pox, Jasmine gave her Pamol but her husband, felt certain that it was something , so they took her to the hospital again.The nurse then diagnosed her daughter with eczema and prescribed a steroid cream called Hydrocortisone.Over the years, Jasmine noticed her eczema got worse and began to spread all over her body. In April, she did some research on the usage of steroid creams and came across topical steroid withdrawal, also known as red burning skin and steroid dermatitis. Symptoms of this reaction include redness of skin, a burning sensation, and itchiness. Jasmine then decided to completely stop her daughter from taking the medication and has now let her skin heal naturally. Throughout her journey Jasmine admits that strangers who see Zobiyah judge her and even wrongly accuse her of neglecting her daughter, despite her desperate attempts to heal her. Jasmine is speaking out now as her goal is to raise awareness of the dangers of steroid creams and the importance of letting skin heal naturally. Jasmine says that whilst the purpose of the steroid was to alleviate her symptoms and eventually get rid of her eczema, it did the complete opposite and her condition became worse. Even though Zobiyah is no longer using the steroid cream, her skin is still quite severe and she is unable to go swimming, as she reacts badly to chlorine. As well as being allergic to Nutella chocolate, she is also allergic to tomatoes, citrus foods and fruits and also spicy food. “[I felt] Heartbroken [at the time of her diagnosis]. It happened suddenly, Jasmine said. So I wasnapost able to process the fact that she had gotten it so suddenly,” she said.  “I was upset because she never had it. Her skin was so clear when she was a baby. Sadly, when it started, everyone who was used to seeing her clear skin always questioned, ‘How did it happen ’ and I felt like I was being judged because to some, it seemed like I neglected my child. “Apart from the fact that she canapost go swimming due to her skin reacting to chlorine, I try and let her do what every child her age does.

A number of amphibious armoured personnel carriers suddenly rolled on to the beach interrupting the tranquility of the Caspian Sea.

The forces were rehearsing for one of seven major shows of strength across Russia on Sunday marking Navy Day, with many naval vessels visible out at sea.Some  ships, support vessels and amphibious personnel carriers like the × wheeled BTR- will take part in the display at Kaspiysk. Protesters hit out at the arrival of the armoured carriers as families were on the beach at the time. A woman said: The water is already contaminated. The military show would only worsen the pollution.  “Russia can only show its power and doesnapost care about people and the planet,” she said.

I find it fascinating how he continued to use similar themes in the many theatres he designed and I’ve read he felt the Ohio was one of his most successful buildings.#The Ohio is one of the few remaining Loew#s movie palaces, and it still is a show piece for our city, both for entertainment and for architecture. Being in the Ohio every day, as I have been for  years, I may take its beauty for granted.#But when a travelling musician, actor or singer sees the auditorium for the first time, it’s often met with a delightful gasp. Its visual spark continues to amaze audiences and performers, alike.#The Ohio is a destination that makes even the smallest of shows feel like a major event.#A story told about the Ohio Theatre chandelier claims that when the designer showed his drawings to Mr. Lamb, Lamb did not seem satisfied.#The designer stated, #I don’t know why you are not pleased it has everything on it but flying horses.# Lamb replied, #You’re right, that’s what’s missing!# And they were added to the design, dangling from the chandelier frame to this day.#The Ohio is home to Broadway In Columbus, Ballet Met, and the Columbus Symphony Orchestra. We also present numerous musical acts throughout the year, and pay homage to our roots with a classic movie series every summer, complete with organ music.#We host graduation ceremonies, government events, corporate meetings and conventions. We have also hosted weddings, funerals and religious services.#In a few years, the Ohio’s th anniversary will be here. It has been a vital part of the community, so its birthday will be celebrated, I’m sure.#Thomas Lamb has left us a lasting show piece and we, at CAPA, have worked hard to maintain it and keep it relevant for audiences today.#With over  theatres to his name, around the world, Lamb more than made his mark on the movie and architecture industries.His work on the Elgin and Winter Garden Theatres, in Toronto, is still widely admired today, not least because they are the last surviving Edwardian stacked theatres in the world. vw, px\"  Built in  and , as the Canadian flagship theatre of Loews, these double-decker theatres were highly intricate. The lower ,-seat theatre was adorned with classical details and red damask, while the upper ,-seat Winter Garden theatre was styled as an #atmospheric# country garden under the stars, with hand-painted murals and ceilings hung with a combination of real beech branches, cotton blossoms and stained-glass lanterns.Both theatres presented vaudeville acts but, after only  years and as a result of decreasing audience numbers, the Elgin Theatre was converted into a cinema and the Winter Garden#s doors were shut # for the next  years.The Ontario Heritage Trustbought the theatres and saved them from demolition in , before doing a complete restoration # the total cost of which was  million Canadian dollars.At the time this was the most expensive restoration project of a public building in Canada ever undertaken.Ellen Flowers, a communications manager with OHT, said: #The original décor that Lamb designed for both theatres in  and  were recreated during the restoration of the s.#The décor looks today what Lamb would have seen with the exceptions of modern-day health and safety and accessibility modes.#In recent years, the theatres have played host to stars such as Celine Dion, Michael Buble, Alan Cumming and Conan O#Brien.The complex is also a venue for the Toronto International Film Festivaland has welcomed Brad Pitt, Helen Mirren and Lady Gaga through its doors, among others.Lamb had a deep understanding of theatre architecture, an extensive knowledge of the building code and an awareness of acoustic, structure and crowd safety in theatres.An article in the Eveningon November   wrote: #Mr Thomas W Lamb, who is designer of the recently-opened Empire Theatre, Leicester Square, London, and is now recognised as one of the foremost theatre architects in the world, is a native of Dundee.#It went on describe Lamb as having been #successful beyond his greatest hopes#.Despite settling on a large farm in New York State with his mother, he made frequent visits to London and would travel to Dundee to stay with his aunt who still lived in the city, any time he was on this side of the Atlantic.His #wonderful trail# of work continues to be celebrated and admired today, nearly  years after his death.With thanks to the Ontario Heritage Trust and CAPA.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

There#s barely been a spare minute.#But I#m not complaining because we#re doing our bit to make sure football and every other business s in a safe manner throughout.#We manufacture revolutionary anti-viral and sanitising products for decontaminating and sanitising all football training equipment like balls, markers, poles, goals etc.“The product range we have is also fantastic for inside and outside the stadium – changing rooms, showers, offices team coaches and mini buses.#Nobody ever thought we would have to take such steps but it#s the reality now and we can#t be too careful.#The clubs I speak to are so supportive. They realise the necessity of it all and are taking every step required to make everyone safe.#It works from the Premiership right down the isions, including junior and amateur isions to boys and girls club football.#Soutar has suffered like everyone  in the absence of any competitive action since mid-March but the ex-Ross County ace is counting down the days to next Saturday#s top-flight curtain-raiser.He added: #Having retired after  years playing football I#ve now found a job I love.#It#s great to be able to use my knowledge and experience from both careers to help clubs at this time.#This is going to be the #new norm’. It will take time to adapt and I can help with that.#Every player, manager, coach and supporter has found the last few months so hard without football.#We#re all in the same boat as we love football. It#s what we#ve been brought up on and it#s what we live for at weekends.#So I#m just glad to be playing my own part in helping get things back up and running.#It#s still an exciting time even though it#s going to be dferent.“From my point of view, I would to see Dundee back in the Premiership at the end of this campaign – in a safe way of course.#GEORGE CRAN: Wage cut agreement a big step for Dundee but still a long road ahead\" title\"#GEORGE CRAN: Wage cut agreement a big step for Dundee but still a long road ahead# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp george-cran-wage-cut-agreement-a-big-step embed # secretXnNEgxDZVD\" data-secret\"XnNEgxDZVD\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

There was nobody  there.#As we were walking, the local people had heard about our story and they knew that we were on our way which was quite amazing.#There were people who had closed their lodges on the trek who actually went out of their to reopen their teahouses just for us so we could continue trekking.#That completely blew our minds, this was our dream and they made it happen for us.#Julie described how the Smith family #jumped for joy# when they finally arrived at base camp on June .She added: #It#s been very cloudy and we haven#t had clear views of Everest so we were doubtful when we reached base camp that we would see anything at all.#But within about  minutes of arriving the clouds parted and we saw beautul panoramic views of the whole area. It was so exciting.#We were jumping for joy because after  days stuck in the mountains we were finally there.#We had waited a long time for this big moment to arrive.

It would be amazing to break a world record!#The family, who began their trip around the globe in June , will now face their biggest challenge yet as they attempt to leave the mountains andto Kathmandu during monsoon season.There are currently no international flights until mid-August so the Smiths will have to bide their time until then.Julie added: #We#re not sure where we can fly to at this point, but at least it keeps it interesting.#To follow the family#s journey, visit www.facebook clanwander For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/07/PJ-PG-220720-01-012_35921322-848x564.jpg ","title":"north east now north east sports centre keeps members moving and motivated during lockdown","story":"Le may have changed for everyone during lockdown, but the mission of one north-east sports centre has remained steadfast # to foster a love of fitness in others.Since closing its doors in March, Oldmeldrum-based ETKO Sports Academy has developed ious e-training solutions to keep members of all ages moving duirng the lockdown period.Pre Covid-, the organisation welcomed around , members through its doors each week, from three-month-old ETKO Gym Babies to retirees who attend its #Exercise for All# sessions.The company’s latest offerings include progressive e-training programmes for its junior members. Families login to a unique portal to receive learning materials and tasks suited to their child’s ability. Videos and photos of their training can then be uploaded for marking.Laura Etko, founder and director of ETKO Sports Academy, said: “We were working on the progressive e-training programmes in the background prior to lockdown.“We felt that e-training could complement what we were doing in class and might allow children who lived further afield to engage with our programmes. The shutdown prompted us to fast-track its release and we’ve had a really encouraging take-up rate.”ETKO Sports Academy has also developed a virtual timetable of Zoom classes for both adults and juniors. With the school holidays underway, the number of children’s sessions has recently been increased.For families whose schedules include the pressures of work and other commitments, the centre has developed an additional, flexible online solution. Its closed e-daily Facebook groups provide members with a task, activity or fitness tip each day to keep them engaged and exercising.“We have always offered activities during the school holidays, as we know that children’s fitness suffers when they stop exercising for several weeks,# Laura, , added.#This year it feels more important than ever to keep everyone moving.#We are all desperately keen to get back to the gym, however we must follow guidance and wait until it is deemed safe to do so. Our priority meanwhile is to offer our members as flexible and broad a range of fitness options as possible. The innovative use of technology is key to this.” vw, px\"  The company was founded by Laura, a former international gymnast, and her husband Vio, a world veteran wrestling champion, eight-time British wrestling champion and Commonwealth Games bronze medallist.They have raised the profile of gymnastics and wrestling in the north-east and beyond by offering training facilities and specialist programmes to encourage young people into these sports.The business started le as Laura’s Gym in . It rebranded to become ETKO Sports Academy in  – the rebranding coincided with the opening of their m national-standard gymnastics centre.On ersying their offering, Laura said: #Again, like many other businesses, we had furloughed some of our staff, so a very small core team had to work intensely to deliver this. It has been a demanding – but incredibly rewarding – experience. We are also fortunate to have an incredibly supportive member community.#The past few months have resulted in us gaining the ability to adapt to a dynamic set of circumstances has been key.#We’ve also had a swt learning curve getting to grips with new technology! We have taken great care to keep communicating with our members and stakeholders during lockdown – and to monitor their response to our new e-training services.#Interestingly, their feedback suggests that they may be keen for us to continue with a more blended form of training once we reopen.#While the centre is waiting for firm government guidance on when it can open, Laura has shown her support for the new North-East Now campaign as it aims to promote local businesses battling through the Covid- pandemic.The initiative # which is driven by Aberdeen  Grampian Chamber of Commerce and supported by creative agency Hampton, Aberdeen Journals, Original  and VisitAberdeenshire # will share inspirational and positive stories, encouraging people to do what they can to support the local economies in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire.Laura said: #We learned about the North-East Now campaign via social media and thought it was a fantastic initiative for iniduals and organisations to support one another as we slowly emerge from lockdown.#The team and I have always tried to support the community in which we operate and this seemed like a great opportunity to do so on a more widespread scale as we all grapple with this most unusual and challenging situation.#We hope very much that the campaign will continue to be prominent as we slowly adjust to le after lockdown.#The pandemic has encouraged many of us to scrutinise our habits and perhaps be more mindful about how and where we spend our time and money.#It would be very hearteninglocal, independent businesses could benefit from this over the longer term.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"when is two metres not two metres","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGovernment coronavirus guidelines have caught the attention of our artistic contributor Ann Thomas.The UK and Scottish governments have been under pressure to review the recommended two-metre social distancing rule to allow more businesses to re-open sensibly.Scientic advisers, however, say a one metre separation carries a much greater risk of coronavirus transmission than being two metres apart.As the debate rumbles on, Ann has her own take on matters.

The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and the outer rim of the p piece is obscured, the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too. They should be able to effectively clear the screen, leaving no streaks or making a rubbing noise. If thats the case, replace them ndash its a two-minute job on the vast majority of cars.ENGINE FLUIDS AND LEVELSIts best to make sure your car has plenty of fuel in the tank before you put it into its MOT, and its possible that you could be turned away from the test centreit doesnt have enough petrol or diesel. The same goes for engine oil ndash so check the levels of this are correct too."},{"url":null,"title":"absolutely-vital-shop-local-save-high-streets","story":"The Scotland Loves Local campaign has launched across the country to encourage Scots to go back to their roots, think local first and support their local high streets safely and in line with public healthguidelines.The Coronaviruspandemic has hit high streets and local businesses hard - now is the time to support them to get back on their feet.

An MOT test will check the general condition of a tyre as well as the amount of tread it has, so its important to give them a thorough looking over. Make sure theyre inflated to the correct pressure too.The legal minimum tyre tread depth in the UK is .mm throughout a continuous band in the middle of the tyre. Tread gauges are the best way to check the depth, but you can use a p piece too - put the coin into a groove and,the outer rim of the p piece is obscured the tyre has enough tread. If you can see the outer rim, its definitely time for some new rubber.NUMBER PLATEIt can be easy to forget to check the number plate, but its an area which is checked during the test. Ensure its the right colour and that its fully legible too. It must also be the right size, too.HEADLIGHTS AND INDICATORSHeadlights and indicators are crucial to remaining safe on the road, which is why theyre a key part of the MOT test. Ensure theyre all working, and dont forget to test the hazard lights too!BRAKE LIGHTSIf you want to let people know that youre slowing down, then brake lights are a key - and legal - must. One of the easiest ways to check them over is to reverse up to a reflective surface - such as a window or shiny garage door - then press the brake pedal and check in the rear-view mirror to ensure theyre working.SEATS AND SEAT BELTSFront seats should have a good range of motion, so slide them forward and back to make sure everything is moving freely and easily. Seat belts should be checked over properly too pull them in and out to check theyre operating correctly and give them a sharp tug as well to make sure that they react as they should doa crash were to occur.HORNWhile youre inside the car, test out the horn and make sure it works - this is something that testers will check straight away.SCREENWASHThe majority of the checks on this list are easy to work out, but checking the screenwash is something that many people forget to do. An MOT centre can fail a cartheres not enough screenwash in the bottle ndash so its crucial that you check to see its filled to the proper level.WINDSCREENAnd while were on the subject of being able to see out of a car properly, its a good time to check over the windscreen. Any damage larger than mm will result in a fail, so look out for any stone chips or cracks.WINDSCREEN WIPERSWhile youre checking over the windscreen, give the wipers a thorough look too.

There was cloud cover, no wind and a sticky humidity. I was almost eaten alive.Scotlands walks are never complete without the dreaded midgeBelieve me, I have tried everything to keep the midges at bay. Among the long list of suggestions that Ive given a whirl are eating Marmite sandwiches, spraying a fine mist of Listerine and taking garlic tablets .Smoke can act as a deterrent, which has seen me huddling next to barbecues and bonfires like they are two-bar electric fires on cold winter mornings.Ive donned midge nets that give me the forlorn air of a beekeeper who has lost her hive, or a grieving Victorian widow.

Irsquom also ready to accept some fundamental political realities.Letrsquos face it, wersquore all just guinea pigs now, part of a radical public health experiment the likes of which has never been attempted before. This experiment is reaching its most dficult phase yet, the bit where the Government has to somehow let people start doing normal things ndash like going back to work and spending money to keep the economy going ndash while simultaneously reminding us that we wersquore not out of the woods yet. They have to encourage people to go out, while keeping them scared.Many ndash including me ndash have criticised politicians for their missteps and mixed messages over the last few months. But I also recognise a number of basic truths that itrsquos better to get onersquos head around sooner rather than later, regardless of party politics.The first is that until coronavirus has been completely eradicated around the world, risk is going to play a part in our lives for the foreseeable future. The second is closely related: the state cannot tell us exactly how to manage this risk in every single circumstance. We may get health advice and government guidance, but ultimately we have to navigate this new, more precarious world on our own.How we do this, and, crucially, how we feel about doing it, depends on many dferent things, of course, not least our age and underlying health, our financial situation and, to a signicant extent, our personality.I know there are some who believe that through lting lockdown restrictions politicians in Westminster and Holyrood are very deliberately handing over responsibility ndash and thus blame ndash to the public for what comes next. And there may be some truth to this. But come on, letrsquos get real.Accusations of ldquomaking it up as they go along are thrown around asthis was an insult rather than simply a fact describing the predicament governments everywhere find themselves in. How could it be otherwise given the extraordinary events of the last six months  And whatrsquos the alternative to us being public health guinea pigs  Staying at home forever Community levels of the virus in Scotland are now low and falling. Our hospitals lie empty. We have a test and trace system in place to ndash hopefully ndash crack down on infections. Meanwhile, wellbeing continues to suffer under the restrictions and hundreds of thousands of jobs hang in the balance. All of these things mean we can and should lt the lockdown. And lting restrictions means the vast majority of folkmust decide for themselves what level of risk they are comfortable contending with, taking into consideration how it might affect their family and community as well as their own personal circumstances.We can help ourselves along the way. Firstly by staying up to date ndash through trusted, legitimate scientic and public information sources ndash about how the virus is transmitted and the best ways to stay safe.We can also resist the temptation to judge others for their decisions. Frankly, Irsquom sick of the army of armchair virologists spouting their culture war vitriol on social media.

In one sense, everyonersquos property is off limits without permission, as it is anywhere . Unless, that is, yoursquore an apple-scrumping child ndash and which of us has never been  At this stage of le a garden with fruit trees is excellent training for a career in the SAS ndash get in, achieve mission and scarper without trace or casualties. Part of the allure of these raids, as I recall, is not just the trepidation of trespassing, but of taking forbidden fruit. Usually we gathered the unripe apples and stone-hard pears as ammunition for our long-running battles, rather than as a source of vitamin C. If kids ever clamber over the fence for our apples, theyrsquod be more than welcome. If they could also pick the crab apples and turn them into jam that would be appreciated.Many aspects of le are very dferent this summer from last, but one thing has not changed. Regardless of the lurgy, fruit is ripening fast on bushes and trees the high season of berries is upon us. One of the most vivid memories of our first August here was sitting in a friendrsquos summerhouse and suddenly seeing three folk emerging from the far end of their garden. Each was clutching a bowl heaped with jewel-like fruits, and as they passed it was aswersquod glimpsed the three Magi.A few days ago, we were invited into the same garden, to help ourselves to raspberries. It had been a day of torrential rain, with intermittent sun. The sky was darkening as we made our way between the rows, which were heavy with fat sweet rasps. When the rain began, I put up my hood, and picked on. The scent of wet leaves and trodden earth was intoxicating, a bouquet richer than a Barola. These bushes had been growing here long before our friends arrived,  years ago. They are kept company by apple and pear trees, redcurrant bushes, and plums that, when ripe, hang from the branches like ear-rings. Therersquos also a large bed of still-ripening strawberries. One year I watched a mouse, on tiptoe, nibbling a dangling berry.Irsquove rarely tasted better raspberries than the ones we collected, their flavour enhanced by the atmosphere of the garden where they grew. Being allowed access to this most beautul, out of the way corner reminds me a little of The Secret Garden. That book that made such an impression on me as a girl that I drove my parents nuts begging to be allowed to buy a derelict Victorian walled garden close by. I would climb onto the seat by the bus stop to look over its wall and plan how Irsquod clear it of weeds and shattered glass house and fill it with vegetables and flowers. Since Irsquod shown no desire to lt so much as a dandelion in our own back yard, I was told to dream on.The garden where we, and others, are invited to forage is a perfect complement to the fields and hills beyond. Flowerbeds, graceful trees and a croquet-style lawn coexist seamlessly with fruit and, previously, rows of vegetables too. When people picture the rural idyll, itrsquos often a rose-festooned house where hollyhocks run amok. Yet the true cottage garden was never chocolate-box pretty but a place where leeks and cabbages grew among primroses and poppies ndash more Mr McGregor than Vita Sackville-West. That is still the case. In one of my favourite Hoolet gardens, a formal square bed of roses encloses a profusion of succulent young lettuces, ready to lt for lunch.This is an artful nod to where all such cultivation began. Originally, humble countryside plots were essential sources of food there was no room for unproductive and time-consuming grass, or patios where clematis and wisteria rambled towards dormer windows, choking the gutters. Wholly utilitarian, they contained rectangular beds devoted to cabbages and potatoes and, weather permitting, caned trellises for fruit. These were beautul in their own way, but it was only when flowers escaped from hedgerows and colonised the margins and spaces between the plots that they gained nostalgic postcard charm.The plant collector, Major Lawrence Johnston, is responsible for redefining the cottage garden. In the early th century, when he and his mother moved into Hidcote Manor in the Cotswolds, he took the idea of a rural plot, edited its contents, and scaled it up. The result, with winding paths, artistic focal points, and teeming, colourful borders, had the appearance of being haphazard, random and accidental, when in fact it was rigorously planned. It sounds spectacular. Increasingly, though, Irsquom coming to think that outdoor spaces designed solely to please the eye are lacking in one vital ingredient: the kind you can put on a plate.Thanks in part to the generosity of neighbours, we too are starting to feed ourselves: redcurrants and blackcurrants, strawberries ndash still in relative infancy ndash rhubarb, carrots and herbs. Wersquore not in the league of those who can nurture asparagus Irsquom told it takes seven years for a first crop to appear. In fact, wersquore not in any league at all. After Alan dug up last yearrsquos potatoes, I replanted that bed with roses, honeysuckle and lavender. At one point in late spring, these new arrivals were suddenly swamped by a profusion of shaws, as the undetected, button-sized potatoes left buried in the winter sprouted into le. Following a striking display of flowers, we now have an unexpected crop of delicious spuds to keep us going for weeks. The satisfaction of filling your own larder is immense.

Though curiously, none of this Moscow gold ever found its way into my bank account. Perhaps I should head across and demand payment.At any rate, we were told by all news sources yesterday, that involvement of the Russians in the independence referendum was ldquoconfirmed by the report of the Commons Intelligence and Security Committee. The evidence lay in ldquoopen source commentary it said, which was ldquocredible.The UK Government scandalously ignored evidence of similar Russian involvement in the Brexit referendum, said MPs on the committee, because it didnrsquot want to know. Surprise, surprise.But how come the committee was so sure about Russkie meddling in the Indyref, about which the Government also apparently did not want to know  Why was the ldquoopen source commentary ldquoso compelling  After all, such commentary is just what people had been saying in published sources.There was no shortage of ldquoopen source commentary during Brexit from any number of commentators, such as the prolic Carole Cadwalladr in the Observer, who reported that senior Brexiters were in regular contact with Russian diplomats and business interests. Why did the committee disown all that The implication was that the true Indyref smoking gun was in the classied annex to yesterdayrsquos report. According to the former UK National Security Adviser, Sir Mark Lyell Grant, interviewed on BBC World At One, it was ldquowell known that the Russians were ldquoamplying social media messages during the  campaign. Well known by whom The published report refers only to claims about voting irregularities made after the  referendum and designed to discredit the result. It also referred obliquely to newspaper speculation about cybernat ldquoMcBots punting Russian propaganda.It rather looked asthe Labour and Conservative MPs on the committee were only able to agree on one thing: that the Russians were obviously all over the Scottish independence referendum and that the Government should have taken better note.According to the Labour MP, Kevan Jones, at yesterdayrsquos ISC press conference, the UK Government ignored the ldquoflashing lights from  and turned a blind eye to evidence that similar Russian ldquomeddling had occurred in the Brexit referendum in . Perhaps surprisingly, SNP MP Steward Hosie, who is also on the committee, took up the theme with alacrity. He chastised successive UK governments for not acting on known Russian involvement in the Scottish independence referendum: ldquoIt must have been clear that had they looked for similar evidence [in Brexit] it would have been extraordinarythey had not reached the same conclusions.Questioned later about this on BBC Radio Scotland, Mr Hosie said that he was only able to talk about what was in the unredacted report, not the secret annex. Thatrsquos all very well, but it leaves a nasty smell over the entire referendum campaign.I think we can all agree that the UK is ndash as the report put it ndash ldquoa top target for Russian security and intelligence services. But the activities of the IRA, the Internet Research Agency, which is assumed to be the perpetrator of these electoral dirty tricks, are almost incidental to the more serious activities of the Russian state. After all, it is widely assumed to have been conducting assassinations on UK soil using some of the most toxic agents known. This was against former KGB spies Alexander Litvinov and Sergei Skripal. These were terrorist actions and clearly a priority for the UKrsquos intelligence and security forces.But social media influencing is a rather dferent kettle of spooks. What I mainly recall from  were the widespread claims of vote-rigging and dirty tricks, not by the Kremlin but by MI. Many SNP supporters on Twitter believe the Alex Salmond sex case was orchestrated by the UK secret service.If, as the ISC committee recommended yesterday, MI spooks should now be actively investigating and judging social media posts during election campaigns, then yet more mistrust and paranoia will assuredly be the result. Why so sure  Because they are already doing this.It was revealed in  that the Institute for Statecraft, and its protege the Integrity Initiative, funded by the UK Foreign Office, was already battling Vladimir Putinrsquos social media meddling from the improbable location of a disused mill in Fe. The Integrity Initiative is all about countering ldquodisinformation and malign influence from Russia, which increasingly originates online.However, these hapless hacktivists strayed disastrously into domestic politics. The Integrity Initiative had to apologise to the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, for retweeting messages suggesting that he was one of Mr Putinrsquos ldquouseful idiots. Itrsquos not clear which of the institutersquos , tweets were alleging this, but we can guess.Ms Cadwalladr had claimed in  that senior members of the Labour Party including Jeremy Corbynrsquos communications director, Seumas Milne, were Russian patsies. ldquoMilnersquos support of Russia is like Faragersquos, she tweeted in December . ldquoTherersquos nothing hidden. Itrsquos completely overt.This is the problem with trying to fight a propaganda war on social media. Even more than conventional spying it is a hall of mirrors. Paranoia feeds paranoia. In calling for the intelligence services to start investigating election campaigns, the ISC committee is asking for something the spooks dearly want to avoid.Take Labourrsquos ldquoNHS for sale dossier, which became a major story in the  General Election campaign. This first appeared on the Reddit website. That websitersquos own security analysts claimed that, while the documents on Britainrsquos trade negotiations with the US were genuine, they were put into the public domain by Russian sources.Do we seriously want MI judging the veracity and origins of every election issue  Arguably, yesterdayrsquos ISC report was itself an exercise in political propaganda serving to taint the  referendum with Russian involvement.

Itrsquos incapable of defending the UK. Not only that but the party is floating on a sea of Russian roubles. Westminster has lain down and let Russian oligarchs use it as a doormat to Britain where they can launder dirty money.Then we come to Brexit.

Forget Brexit, put the weight of the report on to Scotland ndash that was clearly Downing Streetrsquos strategy.Evidently, most rational and informed folk accept Russia was trying it on when it came to the  referendum. Why wouldnrsquot it be  But to focus on interference in Scotland and not look into Brexit is nothing but straight up manipulation of intelligence and security.This all shows what way the wind is blowing. With a new Tory unit set up to fight independence, rest assured there will be more stupid dirty tricks. Only a dummy would think otherwise. That means Scottish politics is going to get weird. Downing Street isnrsquot scared to use any cynical ploy.But the craziness isnrsquot all on one side. Far from it.

Why not have speakers say that itrsquos time to ldquostart getting angry  Thatrsquos not going to put off potential Yes voters, surely Why not call for Union Street in Aberdeen to be renamed Independent Street  That doesnrsquot look daft.Why not have an organiser of the nationalist marching group All Under One Banner say that ldquomanaging Covid should run parallel with fighting for independence  Thatrsquos the same marching group where signs denouncing \"Tory scum\" unfurl at rallies. A tactic designed to win over soft unionist voters, Irsquom sure.Why not start talking about Scottish \"freedom\"  Free Scotland from what, actually, is my question  I support independence and itrsquos not because therersquos some colonial army of English occupation in Peebles, itrsquos because I think Scotland can do better on its own than it currently fairs as part of the Westminster system.But it doesnrsquot stop there. Why not start a new political party and use it to drive a wedge between the independence movement  And why not have that new political party, Alliance for Independence, linked to the craziest fringe of the entire Yes movement  A regional AFI organiser was behind the much denounced protest at the border where Yes supporters wore hazmat suits and shouted ldquoplague carriers at visitors crossing from the south.That ought to work.

In the US the film was screened from the July, hence a glut of \"where are the cast now \" pieces and interviews with its star, Alicia Silverstone.In the UK Clueless was released in the October, but let me creep in ahead of time with a little love letter to the movie.Watching the film was one of those seminal adolescent moments that floats around with you permanently just tickling your subconscious. It isnt the movie, only, that makes it seminal but the entire experience of the movie.I remember where I saw it, I remember who I was with, what snacks we ate and that it was the first time I was allowed to a film with a friend and without an adult chaperone. Heady times.Babe was released that year and also Pocahontas but it is Clueless that stays with me, for viewing it meant a step towards that then much desired and now much resented state of being grown up.Looking back at the headlines of  creates a bleak picture. Here, Ronnie Kray and Fred West died. A gripped nation followed the OJ Simpson trial until the not guilty verdict. The Queen urged Charles and Diana to file for orce.One bright spot seems to have been the Queen Mothers successful hip operation.As a pre-teen all this passed me by but it does make sense, against a glum backdrop, that a bright film set in bright sunshine with a sunshine protagonist would have captured positive reviews.Our heroine Cher is manipulative, she is shallow, she is ignorant. But shes relentlessly, eternally optimistic. She nicely manipulative, theres a kindness in it. She doesnt know how to be anything  but sunny.The film is very much a snapshot of a Calornian high school at a specic time and place and yet it is also curiously timeless. Its writer, Amy Heckerling, created her own teenage slang while the films costume designer Mona May invented a unique style for the films main stars, meaning that, while it is definitively teenage, it is not quite bound to a particular era.As a pre-teen it seemed entirely reasonable to me that -year-olds would be cruising around in Jeeps, using credit cards and dating college guys. It was, ironically, aspirational and part of a wider love affair with American high school le presented also in Sweet Valley High books.Everyone beautul, everyone glamorous, romance and takeaway iced coffees around every corner.The fashions were one link to acting out our Lanarkshire version of Calornia valley girl le. We bought plaid mini skirts and wore them with knee high socks, the stupid things would never stay up the way they stayed up on Cher and her best friend Dionne.We wore spaghetti-strap vests over white t-shirts. We did not wear original Alaiumla .At the time of its release, the Hollywood Reporter called Clueless, \"plotless and borderline brainless\" adding, \"But that wont stop the Paramount release from cashing in substantially with the teenage and young adult crowd.\"The first of that review is unfair - Cher may be styled as an airhead but she is not stupid, shes ignorant and these two are quite dferent. The dialogue is smart and snappy - anything but brainless and only someone whos forgotten their teenage agonies could call it anything . She is entirely responsible for herself in an admirable way. Her report card grades, for example, are ldquoa jumping-off point to start negotiations.The second is spot on - it did cash in. It did cash in - with a TV series following quickly thereafter, books, merchandise - and ironically so. Because Clueless, of course, subverts the Hollywood makeover trope by giving the beautul girl, the one others aspire to look like, an internal makeover.She realises, twee as it may be, that money and materialism are not what will give her a meaningful le. Only education and charity will. If only someone had told us we were entirely missing the central moral premise of the movie as we, for the eight millionth time that day, pulled up our knee socks and tucked down our miniskirts.Clueless was a satirical critique of empty, spoiled teenage consumerism - and it made me want to buy things.On Monday my lockdown film club had a th anniversary celebratory viewing of Clueless.

In the eighteenth century, the island was home to around fty distillers with each farm on the island operating at least one still producing whisky.This began to decline as tighter regulations from both the estate and the government were introduced. Although a large number of islanders were still making whisky illegally, this industry ceased completely in the nineteenth century.#Tiree Whisky Company Ltd was established by locals Alain Campbell and Ian Smith with the aim of reviving the spirit industry on an island with a rich heritage in the tradition.Local production of Tyree Gin began in February  and, once again, the island was home to an operational distillery - the first in  years.Hebridean Pink Gin is distilled with juniper, raspberries and sweet peels.

They also released Broich Single Estate ndash a limited edition gin featuring tea grown right here in Scotland.Why tea  Because Scotland has many historical links with the tea trade with several stemming from Aberdeenshire which is where the Founders are based. When they discovered the story of James Taylor ndash a young man from the area - who grew the very first commercial tea plantation in British Ceylon, they worked with tea consultant Beverly Wainwright to source a special loose leaf tea from the Amba Estate in Sri Lanka.It is both hand-picked and hand-rolled ndash much in the same way Taylor produced his first batches  years ago on the island.When distilled, the tea provides fabulous citrus notes of blood orange along with a minty sweetness. These flavours are paired with more classic gin botanicals such as juniper, coriander seed, dried orange peel, angelica and orris root and a sprinkle of rose petals to create a smooth and fresh juniper-led gin with a citrusy lingering sweetness.The Teasmith Gin doesnrsquot disappoint. A truly smooth classic dry style gin packaged in a beautully simple bottle with lots of hidden hand-finishes ndash it ticks all the boxes.Serve this gin with copious ice, a premium quality tonic and sprig of fresh mint for a truly crisp and refreshing GT.

Having an array of successful and ongoing renewables projects will also play well for Scotland as it looks to host COP-, the United Nations th Climate Change Conference, from November  to  next year, at the Glasgow SECC.Of course, not all green projects will be renewable energy projects. The UK Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, for example, recently announced a pound billion lsquogreen investmentrsquo package as part of the UK governmentrsquos COV- recovery plan, but this was all about improving the insulation of public buildings and cutting emissions from Britainrsquos poorly insulated homes.This announcement was immediately slammed as lsquotoo littlersquo and lsquotoo unambitiousrsquo. Greenpeace pointed out that the German government has committed pound billion into climate-change preventative measures, while France has committed pound. billion.Scotland has an even more ambitious target than Westminster and aims to achieve a net-zero economy by . In this it has been greatly aided by the UK Governmentrsquos decision, in early March to do a U-turn on its four year old ban on onshore wind farm subsidies. That ban, put in place by the then Prime Minister, David Cameron, caused a sharp decline in the number of new onshore wind farms.According to Scottish Renewables, today, onshore wind already has some GW of capacity in new developments that have achieved planning consent. Another GW of projects are currently in the planning process. Offshore wind too, had GW of projects with planning consent.Morag Watson, Director of Policy at Scottish Renewables, said: ldquoScotlandrsquos renewable energy industry provides enormous opportunity to deliver a green economic recovery and address the challenges created by the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoOnshore wind ndash the cheapest form of new power generation ndash can play a huge role in this. The technology currently provides more than % of Scotlandrsquos renewable energy capacity , displacing millions of tonnes of carbon each year. The sector employs , people across the country and brings skilled jobs and investment to some of our most remote communities.ldquoAs the windiest country in Europe, there is massive opportunity to increase deployment of onshore wind and continue to harness the socio-economic benefits of doing so, whilst working towards a net-zero energy future, she comments.Solar and marine power projects are also at an exciting stage, with MW of solar projects at ious stages of development and MW of wave and tidal projects either already consented or in planning.Scottish Power chief executive Keith Anderson says that the energy giant now has plans for a major expansion of its onshore wind projects, with up to GW of new installations planned. He points out that the energy companyrsquos onshore wind farm projects can serve as a catalyst for launching a lsquogreen recoveryrsquo.Energy firm Vattenfall is close to adding the pound million -turbine South Kyle wind farm in Southern Scotland to its renewable energy portfolio. The project is expected to complete by  and will be able to power around , homes, saving nearly , tonnes of carbon emissions annually.The firm has two more wind farms planned for the area, including the Quantans Hill and Whiteneuk farms. Frank Elsworth, Vattenfallrsquos UK Development Director for Onshore Wind, commented: ldquoSouth West Scotland has the potential to become a green energy hub. South Kyle, Quantans Hill and Whiteneuk can play a major part in helping to power Scotland towards net zero and provide green shoots of recovery from the economic damage of Covid-.A recent report from Aberdeen University has added to the lsquogreen powerrsquo theme by highlighting the potential for oil and gas companies to use marine renewable technologies like wave power to lower their carbon footprint.At the same time, Crown Estates Scotland has launched the first offshore wind leasing round in a decade. The ScotWind round is expected to unlock some  billion of investment and result in the development of ten commercial wind farms off the coast of Scotland.Martin Valenti, Head of Climate Enterprise at Scottish Enterprise points out that focusing money and planning on the creation of green jobs could unlock a whole range of new employment opportunities.ldquoIt might seem odd to specy lsquogreenrsquo jobs at a time when any job is important, but we need to think ahead. We canrsquot just go back to where we were. There are a host of opportunities in the new, green space, he says.Valenti argues that it will be a huge coupScotland can demonstrate by COP- that it has demonstrable successes in its efforts to transition to a low carbon economy, capable of delivering environmental success.ldquoThis is where our partnership with the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency and other bodies hold so much promise. We have to start working in partnership with the environment, within planetary constraints rather than with growing ecological debt, he says.Valenti points out that a major expansion in Scotlandrsquos exploration of the hydrogen economy has the potential to reduce carbon emissions dramatically. Transitioning to hydrogen for heating in homes and offices, and as an alternative transport fuel would have a huge impact in lowering Scotlandrsquos carbon footprint, he notes.Using renewable power to produce the hydrogen would result in a major win-win for both renewables and hydrogen projects.Valenti points out too, that there could even be an opportunity for Scotland to regain its former glory as a shipbuilding nation,it could successfully demonstrate the deployment of hydrogen as an alternative fuel for shipping. There is already a successful hydrogen-powered ferry pilot project running in Orkney and the Northern Isles.The Scottish Council for Development and Industry, a unique coalition of business, government and third sector organisations, recently produced a report with practical ideas for government on how to launch a green restart. The report prioritises investment in renewable power along as well as urging investment in innovative projects that will help to move Scotland towards its zero-carbon targets.Sara Thiam, SCDI Chief Executive, comments: ldquoScotland has the potential to be a leader in lsquoclean growth. COP-, in particular, offers Scotland a very exciting opportunity to showcase its environmental successes on a global stage.ldquoBy shining a light on the big innovations we are producing, we can encourage the inward investment of patient capital into our large scale green infrastructure projects, such as offshore wind generation and new technologies yet to be developed she comments.James Stewart, Deputy Director, Centre for Energy Policy, Strathclyde University, sounds a cautionary note on the theme of green jobs versus any jobs. ldquoGreen options need to be able to stand up against all other recovery options. We canrsquot do it for greens sake. However, the more new green jobs we can create the easier it will be to meet our climate targets in future, he says.This article appeared in The Herald as part of our  part editorial series in support of Earth Overshoot day.

On the odd days that the wind isnrsquot blowing, the waves are crashing against our shores, and tides flow from the North Sea to the Atlantic Ocean every six hours ndash as predictable as clockwork.EMEC was set up in  to enable wave and tidal energy technologies ndash machines that harness the power of the sea ndash to test in the ocean. The resources in Orkney truly put these machines to the test with waves of over  metres ndash imagine standing next to a six-storey building ndash and a peak tidal flow of around eight knots ndash thatrsquos approximately half a billion tonnes of water passing through our tidal site an hour. The technologies testing with us not only have to survive these extreme conditions but generate power from.EMECs Operations Technician performing maintenance on the Hydrogen plant on EdayEMEC is essentially a plug-and-play facility set up to reduce the cost, time and risk of testing offshore with pre-consented grid-connected sites. And to date, we have hosted more ocean energy technologies than any other site in the world.One of the more recent demonstrations was by a local Orkney-based company, Orbital Marine Power. Their floating tidal turbine generated over  GWh of renewable electricity over the course of a year, producing around % of Orkneyrsquos electricity needs. Thatrsquos one day a fortnight that Orkney was running on tidal electricity produced by just one prototype. Orbital are currently working on the next iteration of their turbine, due to be demonstrated at EMEC early .Wersquore also working on projects to help progress floating offshore wind, supporting the development of an offshore test site in Ireland to demonstrate a floating wind technology. We work closely with ious other countries around the world to help them realise their own ocean energy potential and instigate the development of a global market for our clients and the wider sector.Ocean energy testing is what EMEC is best known for, however our operations have developed signicantly through the years as wersquove found our infrastructure, skills and knowledge are in demand for progressing other low-carbon technologies as well.Today wersquore also pioneering the development of a green hydrogen economy here in Orkney. When recreated using renewable power, hydrogen is a carbon neutral fuel as it does not emit carbon when burnt.Due to local grid constraints, which continue to pose a barrier to Orkney realising its full renewables potential, we set up an onshore hydrogen production plant next to our tidal energy substation. In  we generated the worldrsquos first tidal-powered hydrogen.This has led to us working on a range of pioneering hydrogen projects, from generating hydrogen using tidal energy, to decarbonising Orkneyrsquos leline services, and even looked into hydrogen-powered gin.As an example, the HyFlyer project is garnering a lot of interest at the moment as it gears up for its maiden -mile hydrogen-powered flight from Orkney later in . The project aims to decarbonise medium-range small passenger aircraft by demonstrating powertrain technology to replace conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft. The conventional powertrain in the aircraft is being replaced with electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.Wersquore also involved in wider energy systems demonstration projects. Microsoft deployed a kW subsea data centre at our wave test site in . The project is part of Microsoftrsquos ongoing quest for cloud data centre solutions that are less resource intensive and offer rapid provisioning, lower costs, and high agility to meet the needs of cloud users around the world.Deepwater deployment offers ready access to cooling, a controlled environment, and has the potential to be powered by co-located renewable power sources, such as the pioneering wave and tidal energy technologies testing nearby at EMECrsquos test sites.EMEC is also leading an exciting new project called ReFLEX Orkney looking to decarbonise the wider energy system. ReFLEX aims to integrate electricity, transport and heat systems in Orkney using clever software coupled with an increase of flexible demand assets like batteries and electric vehicles.This will help Orkney maximise the potential of its renewable energy resource, provide more affordable energy services, and lower the countyrsquos carbon footprint by decreasing reliance on imported carbon-intensive grid electricity from the UK mainland.EMEC was set up to kick start an ocean energy sector in the UK and boost economic development in the Highlands and Islands, and while ocean energy is very much still at the heart of what we do, we are now using our infrastructure, skills and know-how to help the world decarbonise in other areas as well ndash and demonstrate the clean energy system of the future.This article appeared in The Herald as part of our  part editorial series in support of Earth Overshoot day.

A total of  Scottish universities are expected to report budget deficits in the   academic year.The SPICe research indicated that as the new academic year approaches in September, ldquothe sector will face new and considerable financial challenges, adding to existing pressures.It adds: ldquoA fall in international student numbers is expected to be one of the main drivers behind the fall in income. This is of particular concern given tuition fees make up the largest proportion of sector income at  per cent and within that, international student fees make up  per cent of tuition fee income .ldquoHowever, the latest UCAS applicant figures up to June  show a  per cent rise in international applicants to Scottish universities and final entrant figures will not be known until the new academic year starts in September. \"It is therefore dficult to know at this stage how much income will be lost.:Coronavirus: Fears universities could be mergedthey dont embrace new normalScottish universities have an income of almost pound billion a year - with around half from the Scottish and UK Governments. Around pound billion is tallied up in fees from non-EU students and from other parts of the UK.Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, said: \"The report is absolutely right to say that Scottish universities face a considerable financial challenge as a result of Covid-. Even the most optimistic estimate puts losses at over pound million in the next academic year so the stakes are very high indeed.\"The report rightly highlights that tuition fees, and particularly fees from international students, are the largest source of income for universities and recognises that a fall, of any size, in the number of students coming to Scotland will have a serious impact on university finances.He added: ldquoWersquore months into this crisis but the reality is that universities wonrsquot know the impact on demand until students turn up ndash or donrsquot. Recent applicant data has been a cause for cautious optimism within the sector, in that applications are better than originally feared, when it comes to international students these figures are partial and only indicative.Universities have been propped up by pound million of Scottish Government funding for research, while the UK Government announced a UK-wide pound million research and innovation pot of cash, alongside grant funding and low interest loans.The Scottish Government has also announced that free tuition fees for non-UK EU students will be ended after the   academic year ndash with Universities Minister Richard Lochhead stressing that the estimated pound million that would have funded new EU students studying in Scotland will instead be used to fund places for Scottish students.Mr Sim added: ldquoWersquore grateful for the support packages already offered by the Scottish and UK Governments which will go some way to protect university research and innovation. That support is positive recognition that research and innovation will have a key role in the recovery.ldquoHowever, the pandemic has also been hugely disruptive to the many sources of income that underpin teaching in our universities.ldquoItrsquos that teaching which contributes the skills and knowledge needed for the post-pandemic economy so wersquore concerned that this remains on the agenda and we move into next academic year ndash which is when the financial pressures will be felt most acutely by universities.Some Scottish universities are more reliant than others on international students as a key part of their business model. Before the Covid- crisis hit, Heriot-Watt University has around  Chinese students and also has campuses in Dubai and Malaysia.Some institutions were facing financial constraints before the Covid- pandemic arrived, with SFC funding having reduced by seven per cent, or pound million, in real terms between - and -.Mr Lochhead has previously warned that Scottish universities must change their financial model and \"become much more resilient\" warning that \"theres hard lessons to learn\".He added: ldquoWe have to find a way of tapping into the global reputation our institutions have ndash our universities are respected throughout the world and understandably, we have capitilised on that as a nation.ldquoWe do have to look at have a much more resilient financial model and we have to look at how overall, our colleges and universities can be better protected from these global events in the future.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-government-fast-track-laws-crackdown-airbnb-style-short-term-lets","story":"The Scottish Government had put its plans to introduce a licensing regime on hold amid the Covid- pandemic, along with a raft of other legislation that will not see the light of day before next yearrsquos Holyrood election.But Housing Minister Kevin Stewart will fast track handing new powers over to councils in the coming months ndash with the intention that the new regulations are in place before Holyrood is dissolved for next yearrsquos poll.While the licensing rules, which could include local authorities being handed the power to set up ldquoshort-term let control areas under planning regulations, will be welcomed by authorities in Edinburgh, tourism bosses in Skye, which has an even higher concentration of the controversial accommodation, havewarned businesses do not want ldquoan additional administrative burden for next season.In Edinburgh, evidence suggests the explosion of short term lets is contributing to a housing crisis ndash with the fall in available homes for rent coinciding with the surge in Airbnb listings.In the capitalrsquos city centre, more housing stock is now available for short term lets than for traditional private rented homes.A report has also suggested that only one in  Airbnb listings in Edinburgh have planning permission.Council officials in the capital pleaded with short term let owners to hand over their properties to help shelter the cityrsquos homeless population during the Covid- lockdown, but a licensing regime being introduced could lead to Airbnb rentals being banned in tenement flats with shared stairs.:Coronavirus: Edinburgh Airbnb flats help solve homelessness crisisConcerns have been raised over the restart of the short term lets industry in Edinburgh from July , when restrictions were lted for the tourism industry.Residents and campaigners had pleaded for short term lets to remain closed with the virus still a threat to public health, but Mr Stewart warned there were ldquono grounds for delaying the reopening of self-catering accommodation with shared facilities.He added: ldquoI understand the concerns of Edinburgh residents in tenements, and others with shared facilities, but we have to be guided by the medical and scientic advice.In a letter to Holyroodrsquos local government committee, Mr Stewart has confirmed that ldquohaving paused work on the regulation of short-term lets to deal with the pandemic, we have now resumed our work.He added: ldquoWe aim to lay the regulations giving local authorities powers to license short-term lets and introduce control areas in December so that they can be in force by spring .ldquoAs part of preparation to do this, we will be engaging stakeholders on our detailed proposals in autumn.ldquoThe delay caused by Covid- necessitates that this will be a shorter period of engagement than originally planned but we will make sure that the process is effective in refining our proposals and finalising the statutory instruments.The new powers will allow councils the ability to to introduce short term lets control areas, and to ldquocarefully and urgently review the tax treatment of short-term lets, which would ldquoensure they make an appropriate contribution to local communities and support local services, Mr Stewart added.:Council set to take over short-term lets in the capital and use them as homeless accommodationEdinburgh City Council has previously published what it would like to see in a licensing regime, including the ability cap the number of short term lets in certain parts of the city and ensuring properties comply with health and safety rules - while addressing residentsrsquo complaints over anti-social behaviour.The councilrsquos housing convener, Kate Campbell, said: ldquoWersquove identied that licensing is the best route for us to be able to properly control short term lets and prevent the negative impacts that they have had on our city and our residents.ldquoWersquoll continue to take action through planning, addressing antisocial behaviour and frankly any route open to us, but we know the game changer for Edinburgh will be a licensing regime. So wersquore delighted that this work is progressing at the Scottish Parliament and we will get the powers we need to protect homes and communities.\"But politicians have warned that the plans will not go far enough to halt the impact the industry is reportedly having on communities.Scottish Greens housing spokesperson, Andy Wightman, has led calls for greater regulation of short term lets.He said: ldquoThe Covid crisis has really shone a light the impact of unlawful short term lets, especially where they occur in shared buildings. Any licensing scheme needs to be robust and recognise the impact this poorly regulated market has had on housing provision, as well as the impact these properties have on the surrounding community.ldquoThe Scottish Government proposals must go further. For example, itrsquos clear that no licenses should be issued unless proper planning consent is in place. Each successful application is another home taken out of use, so councils must have the ability to reject applications based on the impact on their jurisdiction.Labour local government spokesperson, Sarah Boyack, added: ldquoI welcome the fact that ministers have listened to concerns about the potential delay to the introduction of new licensing powers for short term lets to local authorities and have resumed work on their proposals.ldquoThe key issue is that the control areas which local councils will have the power to establish will deliver effective regulation and accountability.\"ldquoWe have an urgent shortage of housing in Edinburgh so I will be keen to see the details proposed by ministers to deliver the taxation promised to ensure ldquoan appropriate contribution to local communities and support local services given the massive pressure council finances are currently facing due to years of underfunding.Before the pandemic, a new study revealed that almost one in five homes on Skye is listed on Airbnb.But tourism leaders on the island have warned that any draconian rules could hit businesses as it attempts to recover from the Covid- crisis.A spokesman for SkyeConnect said: ldquoIt is hard to project ahead to this time next year but we would like to think the Scottish Government would recognise the strain that has been placed on the tourism industry this year and not add an additional administrative burden for next season.ldquoShort-term lettings are a signicant part of the tourism economy on Skye and we recognise there are some issues which will need to be addressed. However, we are not convinced a licensing system is necessarily the way forward and we need time to consider other options.\"ldquoIn general terms, SkyeConnect is actively promoting a more slow-paced and sustainable visitor experience where people stay longer and experience more of the landscape, culture and history of Skye."},{"url":null,"title":"arts-reputations-liberation","story":"The Daily MailSarah Vine asked why she is allowed to fly to Torremolinos in a tightly packed metal tube, breathing in other peoplersquos fumes for the best part of three hours solid mdash but am prevented from sitting in an air-conditioned auditorium \"Itrsquos not just illogical, itrsquos absurd,\" she said. \"Especially given whatrsquos at stake.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer. Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go. The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence. Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel. If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing. Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport. Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond. The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful. They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff. Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing. “We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping. “You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.”The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked. They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place. Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotlandcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As the need for nature is ever more apparent, the way Scotland recovers from COVID- could be one important way we secure a nature rich future for generations to come.”SNH is keen to encourage and support people to develop their interest, learn more and get involved in nature.

The Eco-Schools Programme is the world’s largest Environmental Education programme and aims to make environmental awareness and action an intrinsic part of the le and ethos of a school. Its participatory approach and combination of learning and action makes it an ideal way for schools to begin improving the environments of schools and their local communities. Eco-Schools work through a simple seven-step process resulting in the programme becoming central to the schools ethos. Schools can choose from ten eco-topics ranging from litter and waste to energy, bioersity and transport to name a few. Eco-Schools work towards achieving awards - bronze, silver and the prestigious Green Flag.The internationally recognised Green Flag is this highest award given to Eco-Schools and symbolises excellence in the field of environmental activity. Over the past two years, pupils of Buick Memorial have been working hard on many initiatives in order to address their chosen topics of Waste, Litter and Bioersity. Together with Eco Coordinators Mrs Carleton and Miss Stirling, they have produced policies on printing, recycling and litter for staff and pupils within the school to follow. Their continued commitment to regular Cash for Clobber collections enabled the school to purchase a number of new bins for the playground. Thanks to Catherine Hunter, Mid and East Antrim Education Officer, the children were able to give each class a bin for food waste, allowing the Eco Club to produce compost for their many planting activities. A highlight of the Eco-School endeavours is the annual litter-pick with Cullybackey Community Partnership and thanks must be given in particular to Margaret Murphy who is always keen to help the children in any way she can. The school is extremely grateful to Cranswick Country Foods for providing a superb wooden structure for the ‘plastic bottle greenhouse’ project and to Barry Tapster, Mid and East Antrim Recycling Officer, for his guidance. This year has been exceptionally busy, with the introduction of a termly ‘Walking Week’ which the pupils and parents have strongly supported. The Eco Club have spent a lot of time tending to the school pond area building mini-beast and frog hotels, making bird feeders and planting flowers for pollinators amongst many other tasks. None of these opportunities would have run as smoothly were it not for the unwavering input from Mr Fleckand the dedication of Ms Harkin . The positive attitude and increased awareness of environmental issues is evident within the school from Nursery through to P and this Green Flag is a welcome acknowledgement of the children’s efforts.The International Eco-Schools Programme is operated in Northern Ireland by Keep Northern Ireland Beautul and is a free to enter programme.

This year, though, there was a real threat of #The Port# being the town that was all dressed up with nowhere to go.There had been no fanfare Easter weekend opening of family favourite Barry#s Amusements. The caravan parks were shut, hotels closed and apartments unavailable to visitors.Today there are still no screams of fright and delight, as the doors remain firmly shut on the famous old building that has attracted fun lovers through the decades. There#s no ride on the old ghost train. Copper coins will find a dferent home instead of the slots in the arcade.But where in the town the sparkle is starting to .The mums are back, tissues in hand to mop up dribbles of ice-cream from small faces. All the seats along the seafront are taken for a welcome breath of fresh north coast air. If anything, the town is busier than during last July#s Open. No golf to distract, no Barry#s to chuck p coins into those slots in the hope of winning a clatter of copper. Instead, visitors are nose to tail along the main street, and it#s come just in the nick of time for the shops and cafes.Andy Hill has been running Troggs Surf Shop since  and said Monday was one of the best he can remember.It#s incredibly busy. It#s all domestic custom, we#ve hardly seen a foreign tourist, he said.The beaches are very busy indeed. A lot of people were probably going stir crazy at home and just needed to see the ocean and get some salt water therapy.We#re selling an awful lot of body boards, surfboards and wetsuits. The beach is a natural asset that we have and it#s great to see people using it. Of course it#s a huge disappointment that Barry#s isn#t open, but people seem to be making the best of it, and thankfully the weather is helping.Monday was probably one of the busiest days I#ve ever had here. If everyone did holiday at home every year it would be a marvellous boost to the whole economy. Some will be quite surprised when they come here. A lot of visitors have been telling us what a brilliant time they#re having on the north coast.Along the street, Alice Rohdich presides over the family jewellers and souvenir shop, which has been in business since  and has never known a time like it.We#re missing the tourists from further afield, but we#re certainly making up for it with homegrown visitors, she said. The town has had to evolve this year. We can#t change what#s happening.We did invest in more Irish souvenirs this year as we#d expected more people from overseas on the back of the golf last year, but that hasn#t happened. But thankfully we#re getting our share of what#s going and we#re feeling much more positive. We would previously have had early morning and late evening trade, but now, with plenty of day trippers, the middle of the day is when most arrive. You can#t really visit Portrush without grabbing a stick of rock and Ann Lamont has been selling sweets and confectionery at Wilma#s just across from Barry#s.It has really picked up this last week, she said. We do sell some Irish souvenirs, but that#s not what people from Northern Ireland are after and that#s who we#ve had in the town.But they#re still able to get their sweets, buckets and spades.The weather has been good and usually, especially at nighttime, Barrys would be a big draw for us. Most of my family have worked in there at some stage.A few miles# drive along the Atlantic coast, Portstewart has always been known as a quieter seaside town than its neighbour, but it has reawakened with vigour over the past two weeks.There#s the usual crawl of traffic along the ocean front. Across the bay the sun glints once again off the cars lining the famous Strand. Orderly queues form outside the many ice-cream parlours. There are smiles again on faces as they take good of the fresh sea air. And customers are like a breath of fresh air, too, for the myriad of seafront shops.It#s great to have the doors open again and see people out and about again, said Siobhan Farthing at home and lestyle shop A Broader Picture.We#re obviously having to keep numbers down in the shop, but it#s such a relief to get the doors open again. There#s a real psychological boost to being by the sea and so many people have told us they#re delighted to be back.Missing out on their day by the seaside, though, were face coverings. Few and far between along the proms, it seems a decent face mask might be considered a hindrance to getting the full benefit of the sea air.

They will consider the level of compliance by August  and could then decide on steps around enforcement.But there was confusion as the Health Minister was forced to backtrack on a statement that claimed a decision on compulsory coverings had already been taken.In other developments on Thursday:The Executive agreed on an indicative date of August  for the reopening of #wet pubs#.Spectators will be allowed to attend outdoor sporting venues where the operator can control access and ensure adherence to social distancing.The number of people from dferent households permitted to gather in a private home is now .Facilities such as bowling alleys and swimming pools can open from FridayHealth officials revealed a coronavirus contact tracing app for Northern Ireland will be launched next week.And ministers have updated advice for people heading abroad.Guidance which had said only to travel overseasit is essential has been dropped. Instead people are urged to carefully consider your holiday and travel options, in light of the continuing Covid- threat.The issue sparked a row after Alliance health spokeswoman Paula Bradshaw said her family would travel to Italy for a holiday this weekend. Hours after defending her plans, the South Belfast MLA cancelled the trip.On Thursday night she refused to be drawn on whether she would reconsider, saying it was a private matter.After days of confusion around holidays, Arlene Foster and Michelle O#Neill are seeking a special summit including the British and Irish Governments to address discord over Covid- travel restrictions. Deputy First Minister Ms O#Neill admitted: The position is confusing for people, it is a mess across the island.The Executive on Thursday night faced fresh claims of mixed messaging - this time on face coverings.At .pm a statement was released from Mr Swann welcoming the Executive#s decision to make the wearing of face coverings mandatory in shops. It said the rule would take effect on a phased basis from August , with a lead-in periodwill see legal enforcement of the measure beginning on August .But  minutes later a second statement was issued, removing any reference to mandatory rules.Mr Swann, in his new statement, said the initial emphasis will be on education and encouragement.There had been calls for the Executive to make face masks here compulsory, after similar moves by England, Scotland and the Republic.But retail bodies said they feared making coverings mandatory would deter shoppers.On Thursday the Executive agreed to give itself the power to make face coverings mandatory in some indoor settings including shops. But the law will not be enforced until August  - and only thentake-up of masks is low. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, and Glyn Roberts, chief executive of Retail NI, had said they were opposed to face coverings becoming mandatory. In a joint statement they welcomed the Executive#s decision, adding: We appreciate that ministers have listened to concerns expressed from both of our organisations and have decided to adopt an initial voluntary approach to strongly recommend the wearing of face coverings in shops. The decision will allow retailers time to prepare properly and also let the Executive develop guidance, better inform everyone of the benefits of wearing face coverings and educate us all on how to use coverings correctly.Meanwhile, Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, welcomed news of an indicative opening date of August  for wet pubs. He said: These pubs are at the heart of our local communities and have experienced signicant financial dficulties since closure in March.It has also been confirmed a Covid- tracing app will be launched next week. Department of Health chief digital information officer Dan West told the Stormont health committee it would be called Stop Covid NI. Use of the app will be voluntary and it will not collect identiable information, he added. Should someone receive a positive test they will receive a unique code texted to their phone. Once the user gives permissions it will release data from the phone to a server so close contacts can be traced, he added.Northern Ireland will be the first part of the UK to have a contact tracing app. The Republic#s app launched earlier this month.Meanwhile, eight new cases of Covid- have been recorded here, the Department of Health confirmed. No further deaths were recorded in the past  hours and the death toll from the virus remains at , based on the department#s figures, which cover mainly hospital fatalities.

He saidthey failed to fill in those forms, the authorities here had no way of tracing them.The logical solution is to ensure that all international travellers landing on the island of Ireland provide data which is accessible for compliance checks in our respective jurisdictions, Mr Swann wrote.I would welcome the opportunity to engage with you on this with a view to finding a rapid resolution, including the introduction of new legislation and data-sharing agreements as required.I believe this would be a signicant achievement which would demonstrate our commitment to working together to effectively address common challenges.On Thursday, the Executive agreed to write to the UK and Irish governments requesting that a meeting of the British Irish Council is convened to discussing travel issues presented by Covid-. The council includes the two governments and representatives from all the devolved regions in the UK.There are some signicant dferences in policy adopted on both sides of the border. The Irish Republic#s green list of countries deemed safe for travel only extends to  nations while a similar list issued by Stormont includes almost  destinations.Ireland#s Department of Health said consideration was being given to further enhancing north south cooperation on overseas travellers, including adding information sharing.Minister Donnelly and minister Swann and their public health experts and officials are in close ongoing contact on a broad range of Covid-related issues, a spokesperon said.Contact tracing continues on an all-island basis, and information shared North and South, as it has been from the beginning of this public health emergency.Belfast Most ReadPopular principal taking early retirement due to mental health issuesFormer Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond calls for united IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases of Covid- as Swann confirms tracking app will launch next week Split in Sinn Fein as council rejects call to oppose Campbell extraditionCoronavirus: More confusion as Swann does a U-turn after saying masks in shops to be law in Northern Ireland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Yesterday it repeated its position that it would not ulge specic details about cluster outbreaks. There have been  clusters here since the end of May.Sean McKeever, from Unite, which is not the Ballymena#s site recognised trade union but does have members there, said the PHA should implement testing of Moy Park employees for a -day period. We cover the rest of the Moy Park sites and my concern would be the health and safety of all workers on that site, he told the Belfast .I think that every worker should be tested on site over the next  days to make sure it is eradicated.Moy Park has said that it is facilitating testing employees and their households at local test centres.Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw, a member of health committee, said it highlighted the need for greater preventative measures for the food manufacturing sector, adding Stormont must show more forthright action.We have seen instances where in the UK and Ireland of tens of cases being linked to inidual meat factories, and literally thousands of confirmed cases were linked to a single plant in Gutersloh in Germany, she said.It is completely obvious that meat factories represent a serious risk.This outbreak suggests that not enough has been done by the relevant ministers to ensure staff safely in meat factories.Belfast Most ReadPopular principal taking early retirement due to mental health issuesFormer Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond calls for united IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases of Covid- as Swann confirms tracking app will launch next week Split in Sinn Fein as council rejects call to oppose Campbell extraditionCoronavirus: More confusion as Swann does a U-turn after saying masks in shops to be law in Northern Ireland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Both apps were designed by Co Waterford company NearForm.Speaking to the Belfast , Stephen Shaw from Big Motive, the company that designed the app, explained that there is a real concern amongst those involved in its development that the general public may not be aware just how useful the contact tracing service could be.You#re talking about avoiding potential future lockdowns, he stated. All of the code, information and everything about the app will be open sourced and public.Anyone that#s worried about it tracking them will be able to access everything about the app and see and check that it#s not doing anything untoward.The Information Commissioner#s Office has been through everything. The higher echelons of the UK Government has scrutinised all elements of it too.People can be genuinely confident that it#s not doing anything dodgy.The app is compatible with the contact tracing service available in the Republic of Ireland and is expected to work with the app being created by the NHS in Great Britain.Mr Shaw explained that this is due to a federated server which is currently being developed for the app.This server will also allow the app to work with other European countries who have a tracing service in the same format, something Mr Shaw called a world first.When asked why Northern Ireland will be the first country in the United Kingdom to launch the app, Mr Shaw praised the work of the Department of Health#sChief Digital Information Officer, Dan West, and the app#s product manager, Dr Eddie O#Neill.Dan West is leading the project and he has been super dynamic and extremely good at bringing together all dferent aspects like the DoH and the Public Health Agency, he said.Along with Dr Eddie O#Neill, the pair of them seem to have a great handle on the subtleties of what technology should be used. The two of them have been instrumental.Meanwhile, Health Minister Robin Swann has asked his cross-border counterpart to consider new laws and data-sharing agreements to help track international travellers arriving on the island.Mr Swann has written to Stephen Donnelly expressing concern about the inability of both jurisdictions to capture and share information about passengers transiting through one part of the island to the other. In the letter, Mr Swann told Mr Donnelly that his officials were facing serious impediments in monitoring travellers who cross the border having landed in the Irish Republic from an at-risk country.Such passengers are required to self-isolate in Northern Ireland for  days.Mr Swann said the system was reliant on people filling in a passenger locator form within  hours of entering Northern Ireland.He saidthey failed to fill in those forms, the authorities north of the border had no way of tracing them.

I#ve never done it and no one  in the house ever had an interest. He just picked it up on YouTube, watched a few videos and away he went.While Daniel remains loathe to part with any of his creations, he will be looking for a new home for at least a few of them over the next few weeks, as he plans to raffle a selection of his craftwork for Cancer Focus in memory of his Scout Leader Beverly Fisher, who died a few weeks ago.Everyone at Whitehouse Scouts loved Beverly, especially Daniel, and we thought it would be nice to do something in her memory, said Carol.Some of his works, including an NHS bear and a dragon, will be raffled off for the charity on a justgiving page we#ve set up.Daniel originally thought it would be nice to have a table to sell some of his creations at the school fair at Whitehouse Primary where he#s just about to start P, but when that was cancelled in June we were left with all the animals in the front room.He#s got attached to them all now but at least a few of them will hopefully find a new home.Daniel was quickly taken under the wing of two local wool shops, who have helped him keep the needles clicking by donating spare wool and hooks to him.The staff at The Yarn Patch in Newtownabbey and Lighthouse Yarns in Whitehead have been great in helping him out when he got stuck, but over the past couple of months his designs have become more and more elaborate. They#re thrilled to see what he#s managed to create.Those creations include Daniel#s current favourite, a one metre long red dragon. But even that is set to be surpassed with his latest project, another dragon, this time five feet long.This one#s the daddy! said Carol. He#s still doing smaller bits and pieces for his school friends and I know the school are looking forward to seeing the full range when he gets to go back there next month.In the meantime, he#s now started to create his own designs. He has no problem following the videos online and the patterns, but he#s now in extreme crochet territory.He#s had plenty of time on his hands to be creative, said Carol. His dad is an electrical engineer and has been working for the health service, so he#s been extremely busy these past few months. I#ve been working at home as a marketing consultant, so it#s been brilliant for Daniel to find a way of entertaining himself.

The Dundalk man is wanted in Lithuania over allegations he was part of an operation to buy guns and bombs for the Real IRA. Dublin#s High Court ordered his extradition earlier this month. Fermanagh and Omagh District Council policy and resource committee passed a motion opposing his extradition with the support of Sinn Fein and the SDLP. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood apologised, saying it was wrong and offered to meet Omagh families to express profound regret. The motion was reversed at the full council meeting this week with  votes against to six in favour and one abstention.Claire Monteith said she cried through the night after the original vote and could not bear to follow the full council vote, instead waiting to be told of the outcome. It was brutally insensitive, she said. This was being driven though by the council representing the area affected which meant I and other victims were being forced to support it.That#s a gross human rights breach.She added: I still feel this had no place in the council chamber and was a deeply insensitive move. I have challenged those who claim to champion human rights to face me, but none have. That speaks volumes.The motion which followed, tabled by the Ulster Unionist Party, took a contrary position, calling instead for Campbell#s extradition proceedings to be progressed as swtly as possible, which passed comfortably.Claire added: I#m extremely relieved and strengthened by the result, and grateful to those who brought the motion and supported it.Campbell was found liable in a civil court for the Omagh bomb in August , which claimed the lives of  people, including a woman pregnant with twins, and injured  others.Belfast Most ReadPopular principal taking early retirement due to mental health issuesFormer Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond calls for united IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases of Covid- as Swann confirms tracking app will launch next week Split in Sinn Fein as council rejects call to oppose Campbell extraditionCoronavirus: More confusion as Swann does a U-turn after saying masks in shops to be law in Northern Ireland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It may not be an immediate prospect but it can be argued that every rational reason for the partition of a century ago has either been eroded, or has disappeared entirely,” Mr Salmond said.The Times newspaper report the programme follows a warning from the UK parliament intelligence security committee this week, accusing Russia of using state-owned broadcasters like RT to spread disinformation, including efforts to “interfere with the UK democratic process”.During the debate Mr Ahern said the current Taoiseach, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin, was right to be cautious about demands for an immediate border poll in order to align Northern Ireland with EU regulations.“The harsh reality is, even though the border has been a big issue on the island since , the amount of work, preparedness and analysis on how you would eliminate it and have one island economy is very little — it wouldn’t even fill one folder,” he said.“There is a huge amount of preparedness, legislative examination, legal examination, how you would integrate the police forces, the legal systems, all of these things would have to be worked through before you could go to the people.“That work has never been done. We’ve been talking at each other for years. If somebody wants to rush it for political reasons, you will get a political answer and the people will reject it.”He added: “My view is not that we should never do it, of course I’m a Republican and it is the number one aim of Fianna Fail . . . but it has to be done properly, properly organised, properly negotiated, trying to convince people, and any other way will only lead to hardship and failure.”A Scottish Conservative spokesman also told The Times: “Far from distancing himself from the Russian state, Mr Salmond appears to be revelling in his role as a useful idiot.“Certainly his Russian overlords will be delighted that he is actively proposing the disruption of the United Kingdom in this way.”Belfast Most ReadPopular principal taking early retirement due to mental health issuesFormer Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond calls for united IrelandCoronavirus Northern Ireland:  new cases of Covid- as Swann confirms tracking app will launch next week Split in Sinn Fein as council rejects call to oppose Campbell extraditionCoronavirus: More confusion as Swann does a U-turn after saying masks in shops to be law in Northern Ireland,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

One of the things we#ve failed to think about is how those transport links work together for the benefit of our entire UK, he added.In our Facebook poll - which is still open - a whopping % of people voting thought the link was a good idea, with just % giving the idea the thumbs down.As we went to press last night, almost , of our online readers had cast their votes in our unscientic poll, with hundreds leaving comments for and against the Boris bridge.One, Stephen Bleue, wrote: I think it would be great to have a road bridge even with a toll as the ferry is very expensive. I know people pour cold water on the idea, but mainland Britain is linked to Europe by a tunnel and look at the benefits that this had provided. We could literally drive from Northern Ireland right across Europewe had a bridge to Scotland and it would link the whole of the UK - which has to be beneficial.Belfast-based Stephen Wray agreed: What is negative about this  Yes, in my opinion it#s something unique, dferent and costs money. Isambard Kingdom Brunel#s feats spring to mind.David Alexander also gave the bridge the thumbs-up. Yes... would bring economic benefit and convenience to the whole of the British Isles. Not surea bridge or tunnel would be best.But not everyone was convinced spanning the Irish Sea was worthwhile.Bryan Hayward reckoned: It#d only be open for maybe a few months total, a year tops, the rest of the time it#d be swinging like a skipping rope.

Liam Campbell, from Dundalk, is wanted in Lithuania over allegations he was part of an operation to buy guns and bombs for the Real IRA.Last month, Dublin’s High Court ordered Campbell’s extradition to the Baltic state.Campbell was found liable in a civil court for the Omagh bomb in August , which claimed the lives of  people, including a woman pregnant with twins, and injured  others.Read More Michael Gallagher expresses relief after Derry council rejects Omagh bomb motion At a meeting of the council’s policy and resources committee earlier this month, independent councillor Bernice Swt sought support in opposing Campbell’s extradition to Lithuania, citing human rights concerns.The committee voted to oppose the extradition with the support of SDLP, Sinn Fein and others while DUP and Ulster Unionist councillors voted against.Members also agreed to write to Taoiseach Micheal Martin to voice the council’s opposition.The move provoked strong criticism, particularly of the SDLP. Leader Colum Eastwood MP later said his party members had been wrong to back the motion and would reverse the decision when it came before the full council for ratication last night.He also offered to meet with the Omagh families to express “profound regret”. The move had left victims of the atrocity “appalled and retraumatised”.Last night at the reconvened council meeting, members voted to stop the council’s support for Campbell by  votes to six with one abstention.While the SDLP changed its position to vote against the motion, four Sinn Fein members continued to support Campbell.The UUP had tabled a counter motion expressing solidarity with the victims of the bomb by writing to Mr Martin and urging him to “speedily resolve” Campbell’s extradition process.Proposing the motion, UUP councillor Victor Warrington said he hoped the council could now “consign this sorry episode in local government to the dustbin of history where it so rightfully belongs”. “This council should defend the innocent men, women, children and unborn who were cut down as they went about their daily lives and not the rights of an inidual whose only link to this district is that he was civilly liable for blowing signicant parts of it to hell and back, killing and maiming citizens and then fleeing, leaving devastation and broken families in his wake,” Mr Warrington said. DUP councillor Errol Thompson added: “Over the last couple of weeks our council has been brought into the gutter and that’s the view of many of our constituents.”Ms Swt accused Mr Warrington of “showing complete scant regard” for the Omagh bomb victims and said his motion fell “very short” in terms of support and solidarity. Sinn Fein tabled an amendment highlighting its concerns about the human rights of Campbell and its resolve to see those responsible for the bombing being held accountable, but this was one of four amendments ruled inadmissible. Last week DUP members of the council lodged a complaint to the Local Government Commissioner for Standards against councillor Swt and Sinn Fein’s council chairman Stephen McCann. They argued that the proposal raised by Ms Swt was not within the council’s remit and should not have been accepted by Mr McCann as reasonable business for the council to conduct. Claire Monteith, whose -year-old brother Alan Radford was killed in the blast, has also reported the two councillors to the local government ombudsman.

The Alliance and Green parties also back the proposal, but DUP MLA Christopher Stalford says it could have disastrous repercussions for the area.The initiative would see restaurants and bars expand outdoors in a European cafe culture system. It would help those businesses struggling to remain viable in light of social distancing guidelines.However, other local businesses say that closing the Ormeau Road at weekends could decimate their trade, and some residents have expressed concerns about potential street drunkenness, litter and parking.Under the original proposals much of the Ormeau Road would be shut to traffic every weekend in summer. Following a consultation exercise, that plan has been reduced to one weekend, and to one Saturday and one Sunday before autumn. The #Open Ormeau# idea originated with Ciaran Fox, a director at the Royal Society of Architects.Mr Stalford said: Open Ormeau is a well-intentioned but ill-conceived idea. The main beneficiaries will be pubs and restaurants who do not make up the majority of businesses on the road. Other businesses are dead against it. Those who do the majority of their trade at the weekend will be hurt.If the Ormeau Road is closed, cars will go down the Ravenhill, which is already very busy so it has implications for residents there.Fergal McAdam, owner of homeware store Neptune, said that  of  business owners he had spoken to opposed the plan.It will kill businesses a mile north and a mile south, he said. The Ormeau Road is an arterial route. When you close the blood supply to an artery, you kill the limb.While such a proposal may bring benefits to the hospitality industry, it did not work in a mixed retail area, he added.Michael Goggin, owner of Michel#s Fruit, said: I#ve put my heart and soul into building my business here for  years and this plan will lose me customers and will effectively help the big supermarkets. The Ormeau Road works perfectly as it is. This will lead to drinking on the street and no social distancing.The name #Open Ormeau# is wrong. It#s effectively about closing and restricting things.But Paul Smyth of Ballynafeigh Community Development Association said there was strong support for Open Ormeau. There is a lot of positivity about it. Almost , people took part in our online survey and two-thirds of them backed the proposal, he said.We revised our plans to take account of those who had concerns, particularly businesses. We hope the new plans allay some fears and bring more people behind the initiative. This event is not about street drinking. It is about opening up the amount of space given to pedestrians.Kinsale has done it, Malahide has done it. We want the place to be like a Parisian street where people move around safely, enjoy each other#s company and support local businesses.SDLP councillor Gary McKeown said: This is a community-driven initiative to benefit the area from a bunch of erse residents. It#s a grassroots movement.It#s aimed at reducing traffic and supporting local businesses. I understand that some are for and some against. Consultation and engagement are essential. Nothing is being imposed. This is a conversation we are having. Nobody wants to go into this with bad blood and we are hoping for common ground.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The -year-old Irish International Driver of the Year and former Irish Young Driver of the Year touched down on Italian soil on Sunday for the next stage of his rally career. Devine took part in the Junior World Rally Championship in  and last season finished third in a stage of the European Championship in Hungary in the same Hyundai i R car he will be behind the wheel of this weekend. After Tuesdays testing day, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy, spent Wednesday and Thursday carrying out recce of the course and making notes ahead of Fridays shake-down. googletag.cmd.push The event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event which spans just under km. “A lot of effort has been put in by Motorsport Ireland and the Rally Academy to making sure I was here,” Devine told the County Derry Post. “There is the support of Hyundai for me to make a championship assault, so there there is a lot of support being put into it. “It is a big step and I would say it is the biggest year for us. It is going to be our first year and we will be on the back foot. A lot of the drivers we are competing against are in their second or third season and have done this rally a few times.” googletag.cmd.push While Devine sees it as a learning year he realises the need to perform and has set his target to in the Junior R category. “The way it has always worked out in years before,you are fast enough in the juniors you are never that far away from the overall podium. “Chris Ingram, last year, was planning on winning the junior championship and he got beat on it by . of a second in the Czech Republic, he lost the junior championship but he went on to win the full European Championship.” Devine speaks of how the European Championship has lost a lot of momentum to the World Championship, but with Covid- forcing the cancellation of other events it will bring all the big hitters to Italy this weekend. “Craigand a lot of the guys who have been here before, there are lot of quick guys that are going to be going for the main championship. It was probably the strongest year in the European Championship for the last five or six years. There are a lot of quick drivers, but thats what you want,” Devine said. During his World Rally debut in , the Park man had two fourth places and a fth place finish. “We were second in Portugal and we had a DNF . In Corsica, we clipped a back wheel and went down, we were heading for the podium there,” he recalls. “It was one of those years, it didnt click for us. It was a big step, you learn a lot from it. At the time, there wasnt much support and you were left jumping into the unknown into the WRC and how much is involved in it outside of driving of the car, that was the biggest shock but at the same time we enjoyed it. “It was a challenging year and we are now back on the Europeanand are where we want to be.We want to race abroad and see how fast we can be.” Being named International Driver of the Year last season was a big shock for Devine, given the field of drivers in the hunt for the title. Apart from a gravel rally in Fivemiletown earlier this year, the sporting lockdown forced Callum into a dferent type of training. “I have been keeping fit, I got a bike,” he jokes. “I did a bit of running, I was in the forest and bought the bike and doing prep watching on-boards from the rallies and keeping myself fit and active.” He pays tribute to Motorsport Ireland and in particular John Coyne for getting another chance to dine at the top table. “He lives over in the Statesbut he is a great of Irish rallying. They have gave me a lot of help andit wasnt for them, I wouldnt be here.” For Devine, in his usual laid back conservation, its time to steer his way towards a podium spot.

The -year-old Irish International Driver of the Year and former Irish Young Driver of the Year touched down on Italian soil on Sunday for the next stage of his rally career. Devine took part in the Junior World Rally Championship in  and last season finished third in a stage of the European Championship in Hungary in the same Hyundai i R car he will be behind the wheel of this weekend. After Tuesdays testing day, Devine and co-driver Brian Hoy, spent Wednesday and Thursday carrying out recce of the course and making notes ahead of Fridays shake-down. googletag.cmd.push The event properly gets underway on Saturday which will see Callum and Brian tackle six stages before a further nine stages on Sunday conclude the event which spans just under km. “A lot of effort has been put in by Motorsport Ireland and the Rally Academy to making sure I was here,” Devine told the County Derry Post. “There is the support of Hyundai for me to make a championship assault, so there there is a lot of support being put into it. “It is a big step and I would say it is the biggest year for us. It is going to be our first year and we will be on the back foot. A lot of the drivers we are competing against are in their second or third season and have done this rally a few times.” googletag.cmd.push While Devine sees it as a learning year he realises the need to perform and has set his target to in the Junior R category. “The way it has always worked out in years before,you are fast enough in the juniors you are never that far away from the overall podium. “Chris Ingram, last year, was planning on winning the junior championship and he got beat on it by . of a second in the Czech Republic, he lost the junior championship but he went on to win the full European Championship.” Devine speaks of how the European Championship has lost a lot of momentum to the World Championship, but with Covid- forcing the cancellation of other events it will bring all the big hitters to Italy this weekend. “Craigand a lot of the guys who have been here before, there are lot of quick guys that are going to be going for the main championship. It was probably the strongest year in the European Championship for the last five or six years. There are a lot of quick drivers, but thats what you want,” Devine said. During his World Rally debut in , the Park man had two fourth places and a fth place finish. “We were second in Portugal and we had a DNF . In Corsica, we clipped a back wheel and went down, we were heading for the podium there,” he recalls. “It was one of those years, it didnt click for us. It was a big step, you learn a lot from it. At the time, there wasnt much support and you were left jumping into the unknown into the WRC and how much is involved in it outside of driving of the car, that was the biggest shock but at the same time we enjoyed it. “It was a challenging year and we are now back on the Europeanand are where we want to be.We want to race abroad and see how fast we can be.” Being named International Driver of the Year last season was a big shock for Devine, given the field of drivers in the hunt for the title. Apart from a gravel rally in Fivemiletown earlier this year, the sporting lockdown forced Callum into a dferent type of training. “I have been keeping fit, I got a bike,” he jokes. “I did a bit of running, I was in the forest and bought the bike and doing prep watching on-boards from the rallies and keeping myself fit and active.” He pays tribute to Motorsport Ireland and in particular John Coyne for getting another chance to dine at the top table. “He lives over in the Statesbut he is a great of Irish rallying. They have gave me a lot of help andit wasnt for them, I wouldnt be here.” For Devine, in his usual laid back conservation, its time to steer his way towards a podium spot.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The Department of Health which operates the local test centre and several others in Northern Ireland confirmed that the local testing centre will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. A Department of Health spokesperson said: “The testing site at City of Derry Rugby Club will no longer be available for testing from the end of July. googletag.cmd.push “Work is underway on behalf of the National Testing Programme to identy an alternative site and an announcement will be made in due course. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. googletag.cmd.push It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Daragh McCauley is the owner of ine Hostages Coffee Company which is based at the top of Waterloo Street. He will run the new venture with business partner Connor Allen who has been manager at Harry’s Shack in Portstewart since it opened. ine Hostages started as a coffee van on the side of the road in Donegal before they opened the shop in Derry towards the end of . googletag.cmd.push “My dream was always to open a coffee shop,” Mr McCauley said. A refined menu at ine Hostages consists of grilled cheese toasties with a choice of good quality local meats and homemade ingredients as well as the best quality bread and baked goods. It was ‘slow going’ at the beginning but the pandemic came as a blow as the business was beginning to gain some traction. With a one-way system in operation they were able to successfully reopen once permission was granted. Mr McCauley believes the quality of coffee sourced from Bailies Coffee Roasters is second to none The most important ingredient is the ‘passion’  Hostages has for all of their products, he added. Anyone using Bailies products in the North West of the country will now be trained at the new Bishop Street premises. BROslashN will offer coffee and food throughout the day and sit-down meals in the evening complemented by craft beers and cocktails. They intend to support local as much as possible through suppliers and employing staff from the North West. “I’ve been working in coffee now for about four and a half years, I’m going to stay managing this shop but will work in BROslashN as well,” Mr McCauley explained. “We’re going to try and create as many jobs as we possibly can. About  people across both businesses. “The barista school will be opened upstairs on Bishop Street. “We’re hoping to open around August  and we’ll know this week whether that’s going to happen. “We’ve a lot of staff hired but are still looking for people with experience.” Mr McCauley said he feels confident opening the new business in the current climate because the people of Derry have done a good job of looking after each other and businesses have been sensible. “Derry has been really, really good so far and the way we will lay the shop out on Bishop Street it held about  people but we’ll be dropping it to  and the tables will be spaced out without losing the atmosphere. “It will be a cosy but modern shop and unless there was a complete lockdown again we’d be very confident with the way we have it laid out that it will work.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Michael McMullan caught up with winning captain Pat McGuckin and trainer Dessie Ryan. *** The years change, success comes in cycles, but the bloodlines stay the same. Connor Nevin was the last Ballinderry captain to hoist the Seamus McFerran Cup after their  win over Glenswilly, following in his father Aidans footsteps from their first Ulster win. Before that, Adrian McGuckin was their Ulster winning captain in their All-Ireland winning season of  ,  years after his father, Adrian senior, picked up an Ulster medal. googletag.cmd.push Both successes came after the Shamrocks unleashed an underage production line that churned out an endless supply of county players, college stars and underage titles. It transformed them into a force at senior level, but it all had to start somewhere. After retaining the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in , the fourth of  titles, Ballinderry tasted Ulster success for the first time in April of the following year due to a delay in the Ulster campaign. They were captained by Pat McGuckin and his son Kevin, only  months old at the time, would go on to annex two Ulster medals, an All-Ireland and was the clubs winning captain of . googletag.cmd.push  Pat McGuckin receives the Seamus McFerran Cup from Peter Harte of the Ulster Council following their  success “I remember us getting off the bus at Duffs Corner and getting on the back of Paddy Conways lorry,” Pat recalls of the homecoming and an outpouring of joy after defeating Burren to put themselves on the provincial map. “He wouldve taken the lorry out for ious celebrations down the years. We went on a tour of the parish, down all the wee roads and there was a cavalcade of cars coming behind us blaring the horns, it was just brilliant.” Within  years, there was another invasion across the Ballinderry Bridge. Their All-Ireland heroes, clad in matching suits to mark the occasion of their first appearance in an All-Ireland final, paraded behind pipers Michael Conway and the Bell brothers. It was the final leg on the journey from Thurles, where the final was played due to renovations at Croke Park. “Its a long way to Tipperary,” they sang in the fading light, as they followed the hazard lights of their late sponsor Colm Scullions Mercedes Benz up Church Hill. “That was just something ,” Pat beams with pride. Those who know him, he is Ballinderry to the core. *** Rumour has it that goalkeeper Pat McKee first stepped on a pitch at the age of  when he appeared between the posts. Man mountain Gerry McCusker didnt come to prominence until his late teens. “We didnt have the same underage winning teams like the generations that followed,” Pat McGuckin outlines. “I remember us going to recently cut hay fields, about eight or nine of us, and playing for hours. We all turned into decent senior footballers.” The club was formed in  and were champions the following year, but had to wait  years for the next title. “We got to a semi-final in  and threw away a title to Lavey in ,” McGuckin remembers. With  minutes to go, Paddy Chivers long ball was punched to the net by Joe Boyle, helping Lavey to a - to - win. The tables were turned in , with the Shamrocks coming through against Lavey after a replay with a team captained by Sean McIvor and managed by Mick McGuckin, who would become club Chairman the following year. “We were getting better, stronger and more experienced as the years went on,” Pat said. At the turn of the year, there was a new management team in place. His brother Adrian, who was beginning to make his name on the Ulster Colleges MacRory Cup scene with St Patricks Maghera joined Sean McIvor and another experienced player, Malachy Conway, as a management trio. With all three continuing to play, it looked like a dficult situation would arise during the season. “This problem seemed to be solved when Adrian sustained a nasty neck injury during a Larkin Cup game in March. He decided to retire and concentrate on sideline duties,” Pat points out. As the the weeks and months passed and with the championship approaching, Adrian got the bug for playing and it wasnt long until the boots were back on. It coincided with Dessie Ryansfrom New York, where, after a time in construction, he became one of five Irish born members of the Fire Department. Back on Irish soil, he bought a bar in Ballyronan and Adrian McGuckin floated the idea of coming to train the Shamrocks. It was the last part of the puzzle. “It was one of the best bits of work we ever did,” Pat states. “He played a major role in our success at that time and ever since.” While heralded as one of the games greatest every coaches, admired by some of the of the greatest players from all over Ulster, Ryans modesty is striking. “Sometimes you get the credit for what the players do,” stressed Dessie, while repeatedly pointing to the the importance of having people on the pitch who could think on their feet. *** Ballinderrys first championship obstacle of the  season was Magherafelt, who were champions three years earlier. “They were a great team and the game was really tight and it couldve gone either way,” McGuckin states. With time almost up, the sides were deadlocked and Ballinderry won a free to win the game. Having kicked balls off the deck since the age of , Pat McGuckin was Ballinderrys long-range kicker, something he was decent at. Two or three times a game he would trot forward from defence to kick s. Even in this twilight years, on Ballinderry Thirds junior championship winning team of , he burled a handful of points in their semi-final win over Foreglen. A team that included his brother James and future All-Ireland winners Sean Donnelly, Darren Crozier and Fabian Muldoon in their youth. “Theof the kick gets longer in the telling as the years go on,” Pat jokes about the kick that sunk Magherafelt and put Ballinderry on their way. “But...being the modest man that I am, I can definitely say it was from within my own half.” Lurking in the next round was a Kilrea team under the management of Leo ONeill, who were shooting the lights out during the league and the Shamrocks were weary of them. “We knew we had to be at the top of our game to beat them and we did, to setup a semi-final with Glenullin,” Pat continued. Ballinderry navigated the Glen to book their second successive county final berth against Banagher, who they had beaten in the  decider. Going into the game, Ballinderry had their homework done. Banagher were back-boned by hardy defenders Sean McCloskey, Pat and John McCullagh. “They had the flying Mickey Lynch at midfield, with Fintan McCloskey and their captain Alfie Dallas as their standout forwards,” McGuckin remembers. “But we had our own star players and from the experience of the previous year, we went into the game as favourites.”  James, Terence, Pat, Adrian and Mick McGuckin pictured after the  county final. Pat was captain, Adrian is wearing Alfie Dallas swapped Banagher jersey. Mick was club Chairman, after managing the Shamrocks to the  title The game proved to be a long struggle before Ballinderry emerged winners, - to -. It was another passport back into Ulster, where a familiar face awaited them. *** Once again the draw was far from kind. In , Ballinderry had drawn Monaghan giants Scotstown in the preliminary round at home in Shamrock Park. “They gave us an absolute thrashing, I think they beat us by  points or more,” Pat McGuckin remembers with an accuracy that defeat always delivers. “What was the draw for   Yes, it was another preliminary round with Scotstown, this time in Ballybay. They had  county players on their side and were going for a fourth successive Ulster.” The media didnt give Ballinderry a prayer and as Pat admits, who couldve blame them. “Dessie Ryan was not a man to throw in the towel. He analysed video tapes and instilled a belief in our team that we could beat them,” McGuckin stated. Dessie was at the  clash and did watch footage of the Monaghan side, but it was on the pitch where the transformation happened. The players, in his opinion, had belief tucked inside themselves, below the hurt. “Most of my work was done on the field. I always thought the field was a better blackboard than talking in a classroom. “It was the thought process of the players,” he added. “I dont want to take any credit, they probably knew themselves they were not as bad as the first day and they had things to prove to themselves.” Ballinderry turned in a courageous performance right across the board. A -year-old James McGuckin had a stormer in defence, while skyscrapers Gerry McCusker and Sean McIvor were outstanding at midfield. Terence McGuckin, still only , swung frees over from all angles. “Brian Duffin sank an unstoppable shot to the net, late on, to send us home with the most narrowest of victories. It was a victory greeted with as much celebration as our county final win and one which gave us great confidence to proceed in the competition,” McGuckin summed up. Donegal champions Ardara, with young midfielder Anthony Molloy in their ranks, came to Bellaghy for the quarter-final. Goals from brothers Kieran and Kevin Wilkinson put Ballinderry on their way to a comfortable victory. Next up was was Kingscourt Stars in the semi-final back in Bellaghy. “We loved playing there,” Pat admits. “They had a big name at the time, with many Cavan county players. It was a gripping game, which ended up all square thanks to a late Kingscourt equaliser.” Replays always cause scheduling problems, but with the inclement weather things got worse. “It was actually fixed for the Sunday before Christmas, December th my memory serves me right,” said McGuckin. However, with a weekend of snow and frost, the game was postponed until the following February. It gave Dessie Ryan the chance to ramp up the training and preparations. *** Dessie Ryan, while he strongly plays it down, is a legendary figure around Ballinderry, often called into management teams. In his own quiet way, he leaves a stamp on any team. While a thinker, he puts faith in players and their ability to make decisions. “Sometimes I think players themselves are vastly underrated in terms of thinking and that they are just there to play. A lot of success that I have had has came from the players and their thoughts,” Ryan points out. It was something the Ballinderry players had. “They were natural footballers and you dont want to stle anything like that. Of course there are positions you need to keep covered all the time. They had this rapport among them thatone went up the field another would drop back. “If the centre was open, the wing backs would pull towards the middle. Nobody would notice, but it could be the dference in intercepting a pass.” Ryan, now turned , was a running champion in his s and his training regime in the winter before the Kingscourt replay, according to Pat McGuckin, remains in Ballinderry folklore. “My memories are the muck and the clabber,” McGuckin says of those sessions. “The nights were freezing and I remember some of the puddles even frozen over. “Ill never forget one drill of us sprinting in a line across our old muddy pitch. Every time Dessie blew his whistle, we had to e forward before getting up and sprinting on. It was horrible at the time, but it developed character and spirit in the .” Not one of the players complained, Dessie recalls. They just got on with it. “Games are not often called off because of weather, so when you train in those sort of conditions and when the day comes, you are better prepared and you have covered all the eventualities,” Dessie added. “I felt it was a good mind-building exercise, to go to near breaking point and pulling the plug. You cant help but complement them . Thats what counts, you are in it together.” It stood to Ballinderry on their February visit to Kingscourt, as Ballinderry scraped across the line in a - to - and setup a final meeting with a Burren team that would go on to win two All-Irelands and five Ulster titles in the s. With the county scene in full swing, it was a further eight weeks before their April visit to Lurgans Davitt Park for the Ulster final. Burren had Paddy ORourke and the McGovern brothers in their team. At corner forward they had Frank McClorey, better known as UTVs Frank Mitchell. Excitement was at an all-time high on the banks of the Ballinderry river as the game approached. Pat remembers looking out the windows of the bus as they arrived at the ground, seeing some parishioners who had never even been at a Gaelic match before. It was a low-scoring game, with the teams level - each at half-time and defences were very much on top during the second half. “With  minutes to go, we struck for two quick goals in succession from Kieran Wilkinson and John Joe Rocks,” Pat McGuckin added.  The Ballinderry team celebrate the  Ulster club title, after their win over Burren “I was obviously proud to be the first Ballinderry man to accept the Seamus McFerran Cup. The two other lads who enjoyed the same honour - namely Adrian McGuckin junior in  and he played excellently through that campaign. “Connor Nevin was the captain in  and a son of Aidan who was excellent throughout that  success, playing at centre half-forward.” In the changing rooms after the game and with the announcement of the All-Ireland semi-final being fixed for seven days later, with Mayo side Garrymore, celebrations quickly died down. With the quick turnaround, Ballinderry tried in vain to squeeze an extra week to help preparations for their opponents, who were fresh after spending months preparing after their Connacht win. “The game went ahead, as planned, in Bellaghy which was a help. Jameswas our centre half-back and an important cog in our machine. He broke his finger in the first five minutes and had to be replaced. “It disrupted us and the other bits of luck we were enjoying, then deserted us as well. We lost the game by one solitary point and despite not playing at our best, it was a game we couldve won,” Pat admits. In the weeks that followed, the disappointment subsided and Ballinderry began to bask in the the glory of their Ulster title. The following week, a Mickey Niblock inspired Nemo Rangers beat Garrymore fairly handsomely in the final,” Pat continued. Since hanging up the boots, Pat has remained a regular fixture at Shamrock Park. He is completing an unbroken -year spell as club secretary. This would have doubled from ious other stints in the post. Ive enjoyed them all especially the recent term as modern technology has made communication so much easier and I have plenty of spare time,” he concluded. “Like playing, there comes a time to move aside and let a younger member take the reigns...that time is very very soon,but Ill still be knocking about at somethingGod spares me.” The more things change, the more they stay the same. Its in the blood.

Michael McMullan caught up with winning captain Pat McGuckin and trainer Dessie Ryan. *** The years change, success comes in cycles, but the bloodlines stay the same. Connor Nevin was the last Ballinderry captain to hoist the Seamus McFerran Cup after their  win over Glenswilly, following in his father Aidans footsteps from their first Ulster win. Before that, Adrian McGuckin was their Ulster winning captain in their All-Ireland winning season of  ,  years after his father, Adrian senior, picked up an Ulster medal. googletag.cmd.push Both successes came after the Shamrocks unleashed an underage production line that churned out an endless supply of county players, college stars and underage titles. It transformed them into a force at senior level, but it all had to start somewhere. After retaining the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in , the fourth of  titles, Ballinderry tasted Ulster success for the first time in April of the following year due to a delay in the Ulster campaign. They were captained by Pat McGuckin and his son Kevin, only  months old at the time, would go on to annex two Ulster medals, an All-Ireland and was the clubs winning captain of . googletag.cmd.push  Pat McGuckin receives the Seamus McFerran Cup from Peter Harte of the Ulster Council following their  success “I remember us getting off the bus at Duffs Corner and getting on the back of Paddy Conways lorry,” Pat recalls of the homecoming and an outpouring of joy after defeating Burren to put themselves on the provincial map. “He wouldve taken the lorry out for ious celebrations down the years. We went on a tour of the parish, down all the wee roads and there was a cavalcade of cars coming behind us blaring the horns, it was just brilliant.” Within  years, there was another invasion across the Ballinderry Bridge. Their All-Ireland heroes, clad in matching suits to mark the occasion of their first appearance in an All-Ireland final, paraded behind pipers Michael Conway and the Bell brothers. It was the final leg on the journey from Thurles, where the final was played due to renovations at Croke Park. “Its a long way to Tipperary,” they sang in the fading light, as they followed the hazard lights of their late sponsor Colm Scullions Mercedes Benz up Church Hill. “That was just something ,” Pat beams with pride. Those who know him, he is Ballinderry to the core. *** Rumour has it that goalkeeper Pat McKee first stepped on a pitch at the age of  when he appeared between the posts. Man mountain Gerry McCusker didnt come to prominence until his late teens. “We didnt have the same underage winning teams like the generations that followed,” Pat McGuckin outlines. “I remember us going to recently cut hay fields, about eight or nine of us, and playing for hours. We all turned into decent senior footballers.” The club was formed in  and were champions the following year, but had to wait  years for the next title. “We got to a semi-final in  and threw away a title to Lavey in ,” McGuckin remembers. With  minutes to go, Paddy Chivers long ball was punched to the net by Joe Boyle, helping Lavey to a - to - win. The tables were turned in , with the Shamrocks coming through against Lavey after a replay with a team captained by Sean McIvor and managed by Mick McGuckin, who would become club Chairman the following year. “We were getting better, stronger and more experienced as the years went on,” Pat said. At the turn of the year, there was a new management team in place. His brother Adrian, who was beginning to make his name on the Ulster Colleges MacRory Cup scene with St Patricks Maghera joined Sean McIvor and another experienced player, Malachy Conway, as a management trio. With all three continuing to play, it looked like a dficult situation would arise during the season. “This problem seemed to be solved when Adrian sustained a nasty neck injury during a Larkin Cup game in March. He decided to retire and concentrate on sideline duties,” Pat points out. As the the weeks and months passed and with the championship approaching, Adrian got the bug for playing and it wasnt long until the boots were back on. It coincided with Dessie Ryansfrom New York, where, after a time in construction, he became one of five Irish born members of the Fire Department. Back on Irish soil, he bought a bar in Ballyronan and Adrian McGuckin floated the idea of coming to train the Shamrocks. It was the last part of the puzzle. “It was one of the best bits of work we ever did,” Pat states. “He played a major role in our success at that time and ever since.” While heralded as one of the games greatest every coaches, admired by some of the of the greatest players from all over Ulster, Ryans modesty is striking. “Sometimes you get the credit for what the players do,” stressed Dessie, while repeatedly pointing to the the importance of having people on the pitch who could think on their feet. *** Ballinderrys first championship obstacle of the  season was Magherafelt, who were champions three years earlier. “They were a great team and the game was really tight and it couldve gone either way,” McGuckin states. With time almost up, the sides were deadlocked and Ballinderry won a free to win the game. Having kicked balls off the deck since the age of , Pat McGuckin was Ballinderrys long-range kicker, something he was decent at. Two or three times a game he would trot forward from defence to kick s. Even in this twilight years, on Ballinderry Thirds junior championship winning team of , he burled a handful of points in their semi-final win over Foreglen. A team that included his brother James and future All-Ireland winners Sean Donnelly, Darren Crozier and Fabian Muldoon in their youth. “Theof the kick gets longer in the telling as the years go on,” Pat jokes about the kick that sunk Magherafelt and put Ballinderry on their way. “But...being the modest man that I am, I can definitely say it was from within my own half.” Lurking in the next round was a Kilrea team under the management of Leo ONeill, who were shooting the lights out during the league and the Shamrocks were weary of them. “We knew we had to be at the top of our game to beat them and we did, to setup a semi-final with Glenullin,” Pat continued. Ballinderry navigated the Glen to book their second successive county final berth against Banagher, who they had beaten in the  decider. Going into the game, Ballinderry had their homework done. Banagher were back-boned by hardy defenders Sean McCloskey, Pat and John McCullagh. “They had the flying Mickey Lynch at midfield, with Fintan McCloskey and their captain Alfie Dallas as their standout forwards,” McGuckin remembers. “But we had our own star players and from the experience of the previous year, we went into the game as favourites.”  James, Terence, Pat, Adrian and Mick McGuckin pictured after the  county final. Pat was captain, Adrian is wearing Alfie Dallas swapped Banagher jersey. Mick was club Chairman, after managing the Shamrocks to the  title The game proved to be a long struggle before Ballinderry emerged winners, - to -. It was another passport back into Ulster, where a familiar face awaited them. *** Once again the draw was far from kind. In , Ballinderry had drawn Monaghan giants Scotstown in the preliminary round at home in Shamrock Park. “They gave us an absolute thrashing, I think they beat us by  points or more,” Pat McGuckin remembers with an accuracy that defeat always delivers. “What was the draw for   Yes, it was another preliminary round with Scotstown, this time in Ballybay. They had  county players on their side and were going for a fourth successive Ulster.” The media didnt give Ballinderry a prayer and as Pat admits, who couldve blame them. “Dessie Ryan was not a man to throw in the towel. He analysed video tapes and instilled a belief in our team that we could beat them,” McGuckin stated. Dessie was at the  clash and did watch footage of the Monaghan side, but it was on the pitch where the transformation happened. The players, in his opinion, had belief tucked inside themselves, below the hurt. “Most of my work was done on the field. I always thought the field was a better blackboard than talking in a classroom. “It was the thought process of the players,” he added. “I dont want to take any credit, they probably knew themselves they were not as bad as the first day and they had things to prove to themselves.” Ballinderry turned in a courageous performance right across the board. A -year-old James McGuckin had a stormer in defence, while skyscrapers Gerry McCusker and Sean McIvor were outstanding at midfield. Terence McGuckin, still only , swung frees over from all angles. “Brian Duffin sank an unstoppable shot to the net, late on, to send us home with the most narrowest of victories. It was a victory greeted with as much celebration as our county final win and one which gave us great confidence to proceed in the competition,” McGuckin summed up. Donegal champions Ardara, with young midfielder Anthony Molloy in their ranks, came to Bellaghy for the quarter-final. Goals from brothers Kieran and Kevin Wilkinson put Ballinderry on their way to a comfortable victory. Next up was was Kingscourt Stars in the semi-final back in Bellaghy. “We loved playing there,” Pat admits. “They had a big name at the time, with many Cavan county players. It was a gripping game, which ended up all square thanks to a late Kingscourt equaliser.” Replays always cause scheduling problems, but with the inclement weather things got worse. “It was actually fixed for the Sunday before Christmas, December th my memory serves me right,” said McGuckin. However, with a weekend of snow and frost, the game was postponed until the following February. It gave Dessie Ryan the chance to ramp up the training and preparations. *** Dessie Ryan, while he strongly plays it down, is a legendary figure around Ballinderry, often called into management teams. In his own quiet way, he leaves a stamp on any team. While a thinker, he puts faith in players and their ability to make decisions. “Sometimes I think players themselves are vastly underrated in terms of thinking and that they are just there to play. A lot of success that I have had has came from the players and their thoughts,” Ryan points out. It was something the Ballinderry players had. “They were natural footballers and you dont want to stle anything like that. Of course there are positions you need to keep covered all the time. They had this rapport among them thatone went up the field another would drop back. “If the centre was open, the wing backs would pull towards the middle. Nobody would notice, but it could be the dference in intercepting a pass.” Ryan, now turned , was a running champion in his s and his training regime in the winter before the Kingscourt replay, according to Pat McGuckin, remains in Ballinderry folklore. “My memories are the muck and the clabber,” McGuckin says of those sessions. “The nights were freezing and I remember some of the puddles even frozen over. “Ill never forget one drill of us sprinting in a line across our old muddy pitch. Every time Dessie blew his whistle, we had to e forward before getting up and sprinting on. It was horrible at the time, but it developed character and spirit in the .” Not one of the players complained, Dessie recalls. They just got on with it. “Games are not often called off because of weather, so when you train in those sort of conditions and when the day comes, you are better prepared and you have covered all the eventualities,” Dessie added. “I felt it was a good mind-building exercise, to go to near breaking point and pulling the plug. You cant help but complement them . Thats what counts, you are in it together.” It stood to Ballinderry on their February visit to Kingscourt, as Ballinderry scraped across the line in a - to - and setup a final meeting with a Burren team that would go on to win two All-Irelands and five Ulster titles in the s. With the county scene in full swing, it was a further eight weeks before their April visit to Lurgans Davitt Park for the Ulster final. Burren had Paddy ORourke and the McGovern brothers in their team. At corner forward they had Frank McClorey, better known as UTVs Frank Mitchell. Excitement was at an all-time high on the banks of the Ballinderry river as the game approached. Pat remembers looking out the windows of the bus as they arrived at the ground, seeing some parishioners who had never even been at a Gaelic match before. It was a low-scoring game, with the teams level - each at half-time and defences were very much on top during the second half. “With  minutes to go, we struck for two quick goals in succession from Kieran Wilkinson and John Joe Rocks,” Pat McGuckin added.  The Ballinderry team celebrate the  Ulster club title, after their win over Burren “I was obviously proud to be the first Ballinderry man to accept the Seamus McFerran Cup. The two other lads who enjoyed the same honour - namely Adrian McGuckin junior in  and he played excellently through that campaign. “Connor Nevin was the captain in  and a son of Aidan who was excellent throughout that  success, playing at centre half-forward.” In the changing rooms after the game and with the announcement of the All-Ireland semi-final being fixed for seven days later, with Mayo side Garrymore, celebrations quickly died down. With the quick turnaround, Ballinderry tried in vain to squeeze an extra week to help preparations for their opponents, who were fresh after spending months preparing after their Connacht win. “The game went ahead, as planned, in Bellaghy which was a help. Jameswas our centre half-back and an important cog in our machine. He broke his finger in the first five minutes and had to be replaced. “It disrupted us and the other bits of luck we were enjoying, then deserted us as well. We lost the game by one solitary point and despite not playing at our best, it was a game we couldve won,” Pat admits. In the weeks that followed, the disappointment subsided and Ballinderry began to bask in the the glory of their Ulster title. The following week, a Mickey Niblock inspired Nemo Rangers beat Garrymore fairly handsomely in the final,” Pat continued. Since hanging up the boots, Pat has remained a regular fixture at Shamrock Park. He is completing an unbroken -year spell as club secretary. This would have doubled from ious other stints in the post. Ive enjoyed them all especially the recent term as modern technology has made communication so much easier and I have plenty of spare time,” he concluded. “Like playing, there comes a time to move aside and let a younger member take the reigns...that time is very very soon,but Ill still be knocking about at somethingGod spares me.” The more things change, the more they stay the same. Its in the blood.

Speculation was mounting over the feasibility of the club championships at the weekend, after  clubs suspended their senior activities following positive cases of Covid-. Banagher and Craigbane acted first, on Thursday night, before they were joined by Ardmore, Limavady, Drumsurn, Magilligan, Glack, Foreglen, Claudy and Drum followed suit. Drum have extended their cessation of activities until Monday, July . “This is a matter for the organising committee, in this instance Derry GAA, to manage as they see fit,” said Alan Milton, the GAAs Director of Communications, while also saying it was discussed with counties on a conference call last week. googletag.cmd.push The GAA has ed to games activity on the principle of opt-in added Declan Woods, Ulster GAAs PRO. “Given the uncertainties that exist around Covid-, each county has been asked to draft Competition Rules to deal with potential scenarios.” Derry have indicated that their championships, starting with Saturdays hurling clash of Banagher and Coleraine will go ahead. Games will he played as scheduled,” a Derry board spokesperson told the County Derry Post. With no movement away from the scheduled date anda club cannot fulfill a fixture due to issues surrounding Covid-, the game will be awarded to the opposition team without any further penalty being imposed. googletag.cmd.push Of the  clubs who stood down at the weekend, Banagher were advised one of their members has been confirmed as positive for the virus. It is understood to be a player and the club moved by insisting all their players get tested. “We resume training on Wednesday night,” outlined senior hurling manager John ODwyer. “Only players who come back with a negative test will be permitted to train or to play in Saturdays game with Coleraine.” The former Derry camogie manager, who won back to back Ulster titles with the countys hurlers, feels the GAA should pull the pin on the season. “For the sake of five games, they should have forgot about it and started again in January. For us in Banagher, we did everything according to plan and it takes a lot of effort to go through with the procedures. “For us, there is just not enough gain. If I wasnt the manager, I would be nowhere near it.

It follows sn announcement fromby the Stormont Executive on Thursday afternoon. The decision is among changes to Covid- rules and restrictions allowing swimming pools, spas and community centres in Northern Ireland to open their doors from Friday. It comes in perfect time for local GAA fans, as Derry club championships are set to commence this weekend, with four games in the senior hurling championship. Spectators at outdoor sporting events where access  social distancing can be controlled, tweeted Michelle ONeill. Ulster GAA, after consultation with the GAA nationally, have outlined the following guidelines. googletag.cmd.push Grounds hosting matches must adhere to the GAA and Executive protocols. Those grounds with perimeter fencing with viewing access on all four sides there should be no more than  people present at a game, including essential match personnel. In all other grounds the number of people attending a game, including essential match personnel, should be limited to a maximum of  In some cases,those with no perimeter fencing, the number might be lower. There is an onus on both the spectator and the organisers to ensure that all social distancing requirements are adhered to. This is currently two metres, outlined the statement from Ulster CEO Brian McEvoy. googletag.cmd.push In line with GAA protocols, supporters are strongly advised to wear face coverings at games. Patrons are also encouraged to bring their own hand sanitiser. Clubs are reminded that dressing rooms and indoor facilities remain closed. It is also recommended that dugouts should not be used. If being used they can only be done so in accordance with the two metres social distancing regulations. There is an onus on all to adhere to the guidelines – by doing so we will help hasten the day where higher numbers of spectators will be able to attend our games in a safe and regulated matter. Further guidance in relation to the use of designated venues, including county grounds, with additional safeguards for spectators will follow.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, where Limavady is situated, experienced the largest surge in cases, with an extra  since last Wednesday. A mobile testing unit, situated on the Greystone Road, was deployed to the area in response to the cluster. Only one more case was recorded in the Mid Ulster area, but Derry and Strabane saw fourteen new cases, bringing its total to . Ten local GAA clubs suspended activities as a precautionary measure in response to the cluster, with only St Mary’s GAC, Banagher, confirming a positive case within their members. googletag.cmd.push A club spokesperson said: “All relevant people have been contacted and the Public Health Agency will contact any club memberthey feel there is a concern. “We will keep you up to date of any information received from them. “The GAA has advised the club to continue as normal, although we have decided to cancel all underage training until further notice.” A shop in Claudy, part of the Derry and Strabane district, has also confirmed a member of its staff is currently in isolation after testing positive for Covid-. In a statement, posted online, Centra Claudy said other members of staff have volunteered for testing. googletag.cmd.push “Whilst we do have one staff member who has tested positive for Covid- they are in isolation since they had the test and are following public health advice,” they said. “The public health authority did not contact any of our other staff for testing via track  trace although some have volunteered for testing and all results to date have ed negative. “We can assure you that we have been following very strict Covid guidelines since we entered this pandemic in March. “Our staff have worked tirelessly to provide a service for the local area, and we have appreciated the support  patience from our community in following guidelines when shopping.” A ‘local lockdown’ have been enforced in Leicester, England, after a surge in positive cases, and the Department of Health said the strategy would be ‘considered’ in Northern Ireland. “With lockdown restrictions being eased it is likely that we will see clusters and outbreaks of Covid-,” a DoH spokesperson said. “In circumstances where the number of cases continues to increase a range of measures will be considered, including the introduction of local lockdownsnecessary and depending on the circumstances as they arise.” Sinn Feacutein MLA Caoimhe Archibald. East Derry MLA, Caoimhe Archibald, has urged people not to panic, saying the figures were proof the Test, Trace and Protect system was working. “It is concerning that a cluster has been identied, first and foremost for those iniduals who are affected,” she said. “Hopefully no one is suffering from serious symptoms and will recover quickly, but there is a general concern there in the local community and that’s understandable. “We don’t want people to be alarmed. We have seen the test, trace and isolate system in place, and we can see how that is working. “The cases have been identied and the process is rolling out. That is critical to containing the virus and we see those procedures working effectively. “It’s a timely reminder to us all that we can’t become complacent, that we do need to remain vigilant and practise public health guidance in terms of social distancing, good hygiene and cough etiquette.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last year, the Education Authorityproposed discontinuing Groarty Controlled Integrated Primary School because of the low number of pupils at the school. Groarty is the only integrated school on Derrys cityside. The proposal has now been agreed to by the Minister of Education Peter Weir. It had originally been proposed that the school would close at the end of August . However, the closure date has been extended to August . Mr Weir said: Having weighed up all the information, including the fact that  of the  pupils will be exiting P, with no new intake for - or September , it is clear that unfortunately the school is not sustainable, and that provision for any pupils in an integrated setting can be made where in the city. googletag.cmd.push The school has been a part of the local community for over  years. It attained integrated status in . A final decision regarding its closure was expected to be made by the department and Mr Weir at the beginning of this year. However, the decision was delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The number of pupils at the school has fluctuated over time but has not risen above  in the past ten years. Ahead of the   school year - before proposals were announced to close -  pupils enrolled. Following that decision, numerous parents took the decision to transfer their children to other schools which was reflected in enrolment figures of just  for the   school year. googletag.cmd.push The EA proposed closing Groarty Integrated Primary School, situated on the Coshquin Road, at the end of August . Parents were ‘devastated’ when first informed of the plans on April , . Schoolchildren from the school then hand delivered letters to then education chief, Derek Baker, when he visited Derry’s Guildhall imploring him to reconsider. The school has a capacity for  pupils and it was anticipated that by transforming from a controlled primary school to a controlled integrated primary school in  that numbers were going to swell. A consultation received  objections from amongst others the Board of Governors, staff, parents, a local resident and the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education. Points include the fact it is the only integrated primary school in the cityside and considerable distance to the other one, Oakgrove IPS, in the Waterside. The school caters for children with special needs and has a strong shared educational programme with Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige. The case was also made that housing developments are planned for the area which could improve numbers. However, the EA says that other schools close to Groarty, such as Irish Medium School Gaelscoil na Daroacuteige and Catholic Maintained Schools St Eithne’s and Holy Family have many unfilled places. The EA argues that the school ‘does not operate within its in-year budget’, the school’s enrolment falls ‘well short’ of the Sustainable Schools Policy criteria for primary schools, set at  pupils for a rural school and  pupils for an urban school.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

One Big Field Party is being held this Sunday on a large green area beside Creggans Linsfort Drive. The event is free to attend, but donations will be collected for local musicians who have performed for free throughout lockdown to raise money for local charities and people in need. Local charity fundraisers Gavin Gallagher and Steven Gallagher have organised virtual gigs and street parties throughout lockdown with the help of local entertainers which have raised pound, for local good causes. googletag.cmd.push We always wanted to do something like this to say thank you to the local acts who have done so much during lockdown, but we had to wait until the rules had relaxed a bit, explained Gavin Gallagher. Some people have said to us that there have been a few reported cases of coronavirus recently andthat spike continues we will cancel the event. But at the minute we are taking every precaution to make sure everyone is safe, including using  security staff and a team of litter pickers, Mr Gallagher asked those attending the concert to observe social distancing rules. googletag.cmd.push We want people to come and to have a good time but we would ask that they abide by the rules. We are only here to entertain. If everyone does as the security people ask then everyone can have a good time. Lockdown has proved very challenging for Derrys entertainment community, with many losing all their income overnight. I would say about % of the musicians I know do it as their full time job and they lost everything, said Mr Gallagher. Many of those that were eligible for government support got so little that it was hardly worth their while. Despite this, they continued to gig online to keep peoples spirits up and raise money for charity. We hosted street parties across the city that made a really big dference to people in those areas. There was one wee woman of  who stood at her window crying and waving out because she was so happy and then she sent her son out with a donation of pound. Another time we heard about a woman who was turning  and we had singers up performing at her doorstep for an hour.One Big Field Party will take place on Sunday from pm to pm at Linsfort Drive.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for the club confirmed the news last night after a day of uncertainly regarding the potential fixture. Originally scheduled to face League of Ireland champions Dundalk, Celtic were expecting to welcome the Lilywhites to Celtic Park, but quarantine restrictions ended their hopes of playing the game with anyone coming into the Republic from the UK having to self isolate for  days. With the League of Ireland set to start next Friday, that would have been impossible for the champions. googletag.cmd.push That opened the door for Derry City to step into the glamour friendly, with reports suggesting that former Celtic and City star Paddy McCourt was heavily involved in organising the game. The hope was that, as Derry City would only be travelling to another part of the UK from Northern Ireland, they are not bound by the same restrictions. That hope continued into yesterday, with the club hoping to finalise arrangements for the game, but they were dashed by the FAI last night. With City set to travel to Dublin to face St. Patricks Athletic, just eight days after the proposed game in Scotland, the same -day rule which scuppered Dundalks plans, also appear to have stopped Derry, despite technically being in the UK. googletag.cmd.push Instead of Celtic, City hope to finalise their pre-season plans with a game against Northwest neighbours Finn Harps behind closed doors at the Brandywell tomorrow night. Declan Devines men faced Cltonville in midweek and drew -, with the City boss running his eye over three new trialists. The Candystyripes face Sligo Rovers in the resumption of the league season next Friday. Celtic, meanwhile, who now wont have Irish opposition this weekend, finished off their mini tour of France with a - defeat at French giants Paris St-German, with superstars Kylian Mbappe and Neymar both on the scoresheet in the Parc des Princes encounter.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Fortunately, a fire, believed to have spread to undergrowth after an attempt was made to set a speed restriction sign alight, did not develop into a large blaze.The volunteers who run the railway mdash who have launched an urgent appeal to raise pound, mdash are particularly concerned about an attempt to force open the main gates they discovered empty beer cans.

However, the claims have been firmly rejected by local people keen to see the controversial plan aborted.According to the tender documents, CIL wants to replace the existing beam with a more environmentally friendly LED light, maintaining that it can do this while retaining the traditional lens.And CIL says while mercury has been used to rotate large revolving Fresnel lenses since the s, with the system providing a near frictionless environment, it describes mercury as a ldquotoxic substance.While pointing to many years of reliable service, the organisation says there is increasing European and international legislation restricting the use, storage and transport of mercury.CIL maintains while it has no immediate statutory requirement to remove mercury from lighthouses, it has been its policy that where re-engineering capital projects are being carried out at lighthouses, ldquothe opportunity is taken to remove mercury.The organisation says with no other liquid medium available to replace mercury, alternative solutions are designed on a station by station basis to provide visual aid to navigation.CIL claims that trials on an alternative bearing at Tory Island lighthouse which started in  ensures the reliability of the bearing solution proposed for St Johnrsquos Point where it plans to retain the existing Fresnel lens which it recognises as important to the heritage of the station and local area.ldquoAs part of the engineering upgrade works, the mercury will be removed from existing optic installations and will be replaced by a mechanical bearing to provide an alternative rotation mechanism, states the tender documentation. ldquoOnly the liquid mercury will be removed and the remaining apparatus will be retained unchanged.ldquoIt is the intention to award the contracts for mercury removal at Rathlin East and Rathlin West lighthouses initially and appoint the successful tenderer for future removals.A spokeswoman for the Lecale Lightkeepers campaign group battling to retain the lighthouse in its current guise, suggested that local politicians will be ldquoperplexed that CIL has effectively ignored their wishes on the issue and the protection of the iconic sweeping beam.She said Newry, Mourne and Down Council unanimously decided to oppose any changes and was firmly standing alongside the local community on the issue.ldquoThe people and politicians are as one on this issue, the spokeswoman declared. ldquoSt Johnrsquos Point lighthouse is part of the arearsquos unique maritime history and heritage and must not be changed in any way.ldquoWhy is CIL issuing tender documentation when it has not told local politicians and indeed the people of Killough why it is proceeding without further discussion with them  Why is CIL ignoring the wishes of elected representatives She continued: ldquoWe have consistently asked for this beautul lighthouse to be simply left as it is. It is working perfectly andit isnrsquot broke, donrsquot fix it. We have consistently argued that the mercury issue is a red herring and nothing we have seen or heard has made us deviate from this position.ldquoSt Johnrsquos is one of the best ventilated lighthouses of its kind and we are opposed to any orce from the current Fresnel lens and its Burdel rotating mechanism.Campaigners say they hope that politicians will seek an urgent, virtual meeting with CIL to ask why their wishes have been ignored and why they were not formally told that the tendering process had begun.The campaign spokeswoman added: ldquoThe St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse boasts what is widely regarded as a rare bit of engineering excellence which we want retained and maintained.

Now things have changed signicantly and the hard work of many people, including local MPs, MLAs, councillors and roads officials have paid off, he said.ldquoThere have been many  dawns over the years but we are now at the stage that work could start within a year which is good news. It is a great pity that Vincent is not here to see this happening.For a number of years, Mr Casement and Mr Fullam were the sole flag-bearers for the bypass, ensuring that the project was firmly in the public eye.While the scheme was making slow progress, the regeneration officials refused to concede defeat and organised a number of meetings, inviting business representatives from across South Down. They recognised that the construction of the bypass was as crucially important for hauliers north of Ballynahinch as it was for those as far south as Kilkeel as their lorries were often caught up in traffic hold-ups on the main approaches to and from Ballynahinch.ldquoThe support for the bypass from all quarters was overwhelming, continued Mr Casement.ldquoI have lost count of the number of locally elected and direct rule ministers who came to Ballynahinch to learn more about the bypass. Confirmation that it is now tantalisingly close proves that you must never give up, just keep chipping away and stating your case.The former regeneration official also recalled a suggestion to construct the bypass and recoup the money spent on building it by charging drivers to use it.He said while there were some opposed to the idea, a number of leading hauliers were in favour as it would save them not only time, but fuel costs as lorries would not be sitting in traffic burning diesel.ldquoIt has been a long haul to get to this point and so many people have worked hard on this project. Successive isional roads managers were in favour of the bypass but there was never the money to work on its finer detail and move it to the shovel-ready stage, explained Mr Casement. ldquoThat position subsequently changed and the scheme has now reached a pivotal point.While the primary focus of the bypass is on easing traffic congestion, Mr Casement said the scheme brings with it a number of benefits.ldquoReducing tailbacks will help the environment and perhaps one of the most important aspects of the bypass is that will deter drivers from using a number of heavily populated housing areas as unofficial bypasses, including the Loughside, Carlisle Park and Langley Road areas, he continued.ldquoThe bypass can hopefully kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre, encouraging new retailers and more shoppers. I believe that the current congestion can deter people who decide to shop where.Mr Casement said the proposed bypass can also benefit the wider South Down area as visitors from Belfast will be able to avoid Ballynahinch town centre.ldquoBallynahinch is regarded as the gateway to the Mournes and that position will be firmly cemented when the new link road opens. The scheme has never been this close in my letime and I hope that it wonrsquot be long before contractors are on the ground.ldquoBallynahinch residents and the townrsquos business community deserve this scheme. It is decades overdue and when it was confirmed recently that the project is well placed on the list of priority government schemes I was delighted.ldquoBut I was conscious that my good friend Vincent was not here to enjoy a moment that he had dedicated a large part of his le to achieving.With all eyes now on the Department for Infrastructure to confirm a bypass start date, Mr Casement hopes that it will be soon.ldquoIt has taken signicantly longer to reach this point than any of us ever imagined, but we have made it, added Mr Casement. ldquoThe icing on the cake will be confirmation of a start date and people are eagerly awaiting this announcement..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22nd July 2020 Brexit ad.jpg","title":"Newcastle Lions Club members celebrate 100 years’ service  ","story":"THREE members of Newcastle Lions Club have received longstanding service awards after clocking more than  years of service between them.Club president Marian McGreevy hosted a socially distanced event last Thursday to celebrate the hard-working lions.Some  years ago Michael Niblett and Peter May, along with a host of others in Newcastle, began the Newcastle Lions Club.

This particular facility could also be bulldozed as part of an ambitious redevelopment proposal.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is preparing to press head with investigative work at the prime Central Promenade location mdash including bore hole tests mdash to gather as much information as possible before it presses ahead with a multi-million pound investment.Council officials say that they recognise the need for modern leisure and community facilities at the site of the Newcastle Centre with several options on the table.They include a complete rebuild which include an extension to the existing centre, a complete refurbishment of the complex or partial rebuild and partial refurbishment.Retaining the Tropicana pool would restrict redevelopment proposals and the outdoor facility is most likely to be demolished, with enhanced car parking also set to be a key plank of any new proposal, in tandem with signicant disabled access improvements.A detailed feasibility study looked at a number of potential locations for a new leisure and community facility in the resort, with the Newcastle Centre site emerging as the firm favourite to house the new facility.Council officials say they are looking at a number of possibilities and that ldquoall options for the redevelopment of the town centre site are on the table.The existing Newcastle Centre forms part of the historic Annesley Buildings which enjoys protected status, but itrsquos believed that the cost of redeveloping the property and replacing the old extension at the rear would be signicant.It is also believed that an added problem facing the council is that the size of the existing centrersquos rooms are too small and unsuitable for modern needs. One possibility is that the facade of the current building would be retained, with a new-build at the rear.Council officials say that any plan to redevelop the Central Promenade site will not impact on any part of the promenade at the rear of the building.They insist that they are committed to the Newcastle project and recognise that it has a key role to play, meeting the needs of local people and visitors alike, particularly during inclement weather.It has also been confirmed that local people are to be asked for their views on redeveloping the site as part of a pre-planning application process, to come up with a favourable design.Senior council officials say that they recognise that as one of Northern Irelandrsquos premier tourist resorts, Newcastle does not have a modern indoor facility which has been its Achilles heel for some considerable time.Two sites were previously identied for a new leisure centre in the resort, with sports pitches at Donard Park the preferred option.However, councillors subsequently switched attention to the former St. Maryrsquos Girlsrsquo Primary School campus at Shanslieve Drive. Despite a number of attempts to secure the site and hopes that a deal could be agreed with local church officials, it was bought by supermarket giant Lidl.Politicians are keen for Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take the lead and ensure that a high class leisure community facility, which has been talked about in the resort for decades, is finally delivered.They insist that the provision of modern accommodation in the heart of Newcastle is long overdue and that the lsquoonce in a generationrsquo opportunity to deliver a modern, indoor facility must not be squandered.Some politicians say it is also critical to maximise every available square inch of space at the site to deliver a high quality centre..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11610600.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...We are now seeing the value of an official opposition, financed and incentivised out of self-interest to probe what the government is doing.In the absence of an opposition, and with less than % of MLAs from parties not in government, the Assembly has rows of overwhelmingly obedient servants of their parties who vote as they are directed by their leaders, with scant evidence of questioning legislation what many of them must by now realise is far more signicant than is claimed.The bill involves complex legal and constitutional issues. But, contrary to Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill’s claims that it merely “claries” the law, several respected lawyers have said what even to a non-lawyer seems clear – this would make major alterations to ministerial power. In simple terms, the bill makes two key changes. Firstly, it gives the Infrastructure Minister complete autonomy to take the biggest planning decisions regardless of the Executive’s views on such a decision, it could do nothing to intervene. Senior solicitor Maria O’Loan from Belfast law firm Tughans has highlighted that this fundamentally alters the Belfast Agreement, putting planning decisions – “no matter how controversial or signicant, and regardless of how many other departments that decision would affect” – entirely outside its carefully constructed cross-community architecture.In a society where almost any decision can be perceived to have a green or orange tinge, this sht – especially under any future planning minister more tribally partisan than the incumbent, Nichola Mallon – could precipitate dficulty. Yet, with MLAs just days away from completing legislative scrutiny of the bill, that aspect of the change has not even been mentioned in Stormont.Secondly, the bill would weaken the changes secured by the DUP at St Andrews in  by undermining that agreement’s curtailment of inidual ministers’ powers.It is that change – and the fact that Mrs Foster appears ignorant that it is even happening – which has so alarmed Richard Bullick, the man who was the key backroom strategist for the DUP for most of the time from  to .A trained lawyer who was central to how St Andrews was crafted, Mr Bullick was the DUP’s key internal legal adviser on carefully-selected judicial reviews in the years after St Andrews which the DUP used to clary in case law that the Executive had to agree signicant, controversial or cross-cutting decisions.Given those years of work to construct a framework aimed at preventing any repeat of Martin McGuinness’s unilateral  decision to abolish the Eleven Plus, he has expressed bewildered dismay at how that is being casually discarded.Indeed, the First Minister who is proposing that the DUP’s governmental philosophy of two decades be altered is the same Arlene Foster whose own lawyer made arguments in court on her behalf for wide collective responsibility – but is now ramming through legislation premised on the basis that such an idea is flawed.Emanating from a First Minister who is a lawyer and who just a few years ago boasted of her attention to detail, the ignorance and incoherence of her position is staggering.Yet, even after Mr Bullick’s searing critique of the implications of what she is doing, Mrs Foster did not feel compelled to explain herself or even appear in the Assembly chamber for the ten minutes which the Assembly devoted to the bill on Tuesday before nodding it through with only the UUP and People Before Profit dissenting.Since this seminal bill was first published  days ago, the entirety of the time spent by the Assembly and its committees in examining it is a pitul one hour and  minutes - and that includes the time spent voting on the bill.It says much about the Assembly that there has been more scrutiny of this law outside the chamber – by Mr Bullick, Ms O’Loan, and other lawyers – than there has been within the Assembly where not one of the issues they identied were raised, even after they had been covered extensively by this newspaper.What is happening here is reminiscent of another stark example of MLAs’ inability to perform their most basic roles as legislators. On December ,  a largely empty Assembly chamber nodded through legislation to expand the RHI scheme at a point when cash for ash was about to run over budget.As with this bill, many MLAs saw the Renewable Heat Incentive Scheme Regulations as a dry, technical and uncontroversial bill – with none of them noticing that it was the moment where Mrs Foster’s department had said it would introduce cost controls, which now had vanished.But in at least one sense, what is happening now is even less explicable than what happened then. Not only has the RHI scandal exposed the weaknesses of ministers and civil servants to an extent that MLAs might be expected to interrogate what is put before them, but in  there had not been clear public warnings – as have come from Mr Bullick and Ms O’Loan – about the implications of what was before them.Yet despite the warnings here, and the lack of any counter-argument from Mrs Foster or Ms O’Neill, there is scant evidence of intellectual curiosity on the benches of the DUP, Sinn Féin, SDLP or Alliance as to whether what they have been told by Stormont Castle is any more factual than the contents of the Beano.Out of  MLAs, only one – the UUP’s Doug Beattie – has tabled an amendment which would not deal with the planning issue, but which would stop every other minister being given greater powers.It is emblematic of the signicance of this issue that Mr Bullick, the beating heart of the DUP for longer than Mrs Foster has been in the party, has now publicly endorsed Mr Beattie’s amendment as a means of avoiding the passage of “dangerous” legislation.And yet, there is an argument for this bill. In fact, there is an argument for going much further and giving inidual ministers largely unchecked powers to run departments and then be held accountable by voters.But it’s not an argument with which Mrs Foster has even engaged and it contradicts central DUP policy designed to prevent Sinn Féin ministers being allowed to reshape Northern Ireland in radical ways without a brake in the Executive.But most astonishing is this: Mrs Foster has built this legislation on a fallacy, taking comfort from what she claimed to MLAs was a law which allows three Executive ministers to call any decision into the Executive where the DUP has a veto.Devastatingly, Mr Bullick – the man who perhaps knows this area of law better than anyone in Northern Ireland – has explained that no such power exists. In response, the First Minister never flinched, but carried on regardless.And not only did not a single MLA at any point highlight that the First Minister’s claim was inaccurate, but the SDLP chairman of the committee tasked with scrutinising Mrs Foster’s department, Colin McGrath, uncritically repeated her claim as fact.With an Assembly this self-evidently incompetent scrutinising an Executive proposing legislation it does not understand and which is based on a basic error, what really has changed at Stormont Arlene Foster still backs ‘dangerous’ law – but offers no rebuttal of ex-aide’s warningRichard Bullick: The DUP won key safeguards for unionism, yet seems to be sleepwalking into removing them——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityCross Common bridge in Dinas Powys was closed off to drivers in February , after a new access road was built and the safety of the old bridge was questioned.The council abandoned the bridge and put up red and white plastic barriers to stop traffic driving over it.In August last year, the council promised to begin the work to remove the bridge that October mdash after delays in finding a specialist contractor.Now, with the bridge still there a year later, Plaid Cymru community councillors are demanding the council act, and either remove the bridge or turn it into a footpath and clear the debris and plastic barriers.Cllr Chris Franks said: ldquoFor three years, the Vale has said this bridge has got to go. If theyrsquore going to do it, theyrsquove got to get on with it. These ugly barriers are so frustrating, and thousands of people see it.ldquoThey did some excavations and just left the spoil heap. Itrsquos a vast improvement now, but even cleaned up itrsquos still a mess.Jean Webber, who lives nearby on Llwyn Derwen, said she has witnessed a lot of fly-tippers dumping rubbish at the bridge, like fridges, freezers and buildersrsquo rubbish. She said: ldquoI think this end of Dinas has been forgotten. [The council] seems to concentrate on the other end.ldquoI walk past here every day. It wouldnrsquot be so badthey just walled it off. I never complain, but this is just appalling.The council has now promised work will begin to remove the bridge next month, and blamed coronavirus for the most recent delay. The new timetable is to finish the job by this October.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoUnfortunately, the contractor originally appointed to remove the bridge withdrew from the project after agreement couldnrsquot be reached on a claim for additional costs due to the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoThat meant a new contractor had to be found, a process that added to the delay caused by the pandemic itself, which for a period prevented work of this type being carried out.ldquoThe council has now successfully appointed a new contractor and received an indication that work is expected to start in mid-August. It is anticipated the work will be completed by the end of October.But both Cllr Franks and Ms Webber raised doubts about the new timetable. Cllr Franks said: ldquoWe are always told it will start in six to eight weeks. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A youth Assembly is a fantastic setting to encourage debate and allow our young people to opportunity to hold their elected representatives to account. They must not be weary of pursuing their own agenda and really making their mark on the issues that matter to them.“Over the coming two year period the Alliance Party is looking forward to engaging further with the Youth Assembly and we hope to see an inclusive body, reflective of our society today.”A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.
