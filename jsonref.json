The plastic bag that had been their portable toilet burst. With the metal sphere jolting and spinning, they were helpless, thrown about in what Chapman called, ‘a crazy upside-down world of noise, foul smell and fear’.The greatest of those fears was that the rescue line would snap and the sub would fall again.The ascent had to be halted twice — the first time because one of the other subs was entangled in the rescue line, the second time to attach another, stronger rope.Even when the Pisces III reached the surface, would it be possible to open the cabin hatch? It was badly damaged, and there was every chance it was jammed.The rescue team tried to force the bolts securing the hatch, as Mallinson and Chapman, still trapped inside, hammered on it with their fists.At last, with a tremendous bang, the lid slammed open. At that point, British to the last, the two men had their only argument of the entire, catastrophic episode — each insisting the other should be first through the hatch to safety.Later, when the cylinder was examined, they discovered how close they really came to suffocation. There was enough oxygen left for just 12 more minutes.Roger Chapman went on to pioneer the use of unmanned submarines, and was an adviser to the team that tried to rescue the crew of the stricken Russian Kursk nuclear submarine in 2000. He avoided using lifts after the Pisces accident. He died last year, aged 74, from cancer.Roger Mallinson continued to work in Vickers submersibles for five more years. He is now a keen restorer of classic cars and steam engines. Until Chapman’s death, the two men met every year at the anniversary of the Pisces accident, to enjoy a pint together.Adapted from The Dive: The Untold Story Of The World’s Deepest Submarine Rescue, by Stephen McGinty, to be published by HarperCollins on June 10 at £16.99. © Stephen McGinty 2021. To order a copy for £15.12 go to mailshop.co.ukbooks or call 020 3308 9193.

Mr Hancock was made Health Secretary in July 2018.

A study carried out by Essity in the past year found that incontinence was seen as even more difficult to discuss than depression. Many doctors speak of male patients using their wives’ sanitary pads so they don’t end up with a soggy pair of boxers, or staying indoors due to “bladder leash” – the fear of not being able to locate a loo when leaving the house. When is male incontinence most likely to strike?There are different types of incontinence, with men most likely to experience “urge incontinence”. If you’ve ever felt a strong, unexplained impulse to pee, but find you’ve only got a few seconds to sprint to the bathroom, it’s probably urge incontinence. That’s why some men suffer “latchkey incontinence”, the sensation that the floodgates are about to open the moment you twist the key in your front door. Our internal plumbing is usually to blame for leakage, particularly overactive detrusor muscles. When these muscles contract too often (perhaps because you’ve had too much alcohol, too few fluids or even because you’re constipated), it can result in an uncontrollable urge to urinate at unforeseen moments, such as when you hear running water. Other factors that may make it harder to avoid dampness down under include being overweight or having had surgery for prostate cancer, which can result in weakened muscles. Men are also likely to experience post-micturition dribble, which causes a map-like stain to form on underpants after urinating. It’s often down to weakened pelvic floor muscles. What other types of incontinence are there?Men can also experience stress incontinence. That’s not “stress” as in feeling overwhelmed by a bulging inbox, but “stress” as in pressure. It happens when the bladder is put under sudden strain, such as coughing, sneezing, laughing or lifting weights in the gym, all of which can cause urine to leak, possibly because the pelvic floor muscles are weak. Incontinence can also be caused by overflow incontinence (also known as chronic urinary retention). This is when the bladder doesn’t entirely empty, resulting in a man passing small trickles of urine regularly, along with a feeling that the bladder is constantly full. How can I manage my incontinence so I can lead a normal life again?For starters, go and get a checkup with your GP to help you find out the cause. A trip to your GP may result in you being prescribed a course of antibiotics, or given advice on how lifestyle choices (see below) could alleviate symptoms. Until that’s addressed, and any changes kick in, many men have found the easiest way to manage their urine leakage is by using incontinence products, which allow them to enjoy the social activities they did before. Unsure where to start? Try TENA’s free Keep Control sample pack, which arrives discreetly packaged and allows you to road-test the incontinence tech that works best for you. This could be absorbent protective pads or underpants that look just like normal boxer shorts but keep nether regions dry. What else can I do to prevent bladder attacks?Not gulping down endless cups of tea and coffee during your working day can help, as caffeine is a diuretic that can increase the amount of urine you make. That said, it’s important to drink enough fluids so try to sip plenty of water throughout the day. Eating a healthy diet and keeping to a good weight is also beneficial, as being overweight puts pressure on the bladder. And don’t forget the pelvic floor, the muscles that hold the bladder and rectum in place. Men have less active pelvic floors than women so any exercises that strengthen them, such as pilates, are great.

Photograph: David Paul MorrisBloombergA further 467 cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed in the State, according to the National Public Health Emergency Team.There are 38 people in ICU, and 99 in hospital. The Dephartment of Health added that daily case numbers may change due to future data review, validation and update.Meanwhile, pregnant women are being offered the Pfizer or Moderna Covid-19 vaccines following a recommendation by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac).Women whose pregnancy is between 14 and 36 weeks are being encouraged by the HSE to take up the Covid-19 vaccine when it is offered to them.All 19 maternity hospitalsunits in Ireland are contacting pregnant women and offering them a consultation to discuss the vaccine with their obstetric caregiver. The HSE said this could be a midwife, GP or obstetrician.Following this consultation, people can be vaccinated by the hospital or referred to a vaccination centre.The HSE is looking at starting an information campaign around the benefits of the vaccine for pregnant women after it emerged just one in five pregnant women offered the Covid-19 vaccine in some of the State’s maternity hospitals have taken up the offer.The acceptance of the vaccines varies widely, ranging between 20 and 60 per cent across all maternity hospitals, with about 3,800 pregnant women vaccinated under the programme out of a total of 12,000 consultations.Dr Peter McKenna, national clinical director of the HSE National Women and Infants Health Programme, said: “The information we have so far shows that the Covid-19 vaccines do not have any negative effect on babies in the womb.“We would strongly encourage people to consider taking up their vaccine when offered as it greatly reduces the chances of you becoming unwell from the Covid-19 virus.”Dr McKenna added: “Unfortunately, the process of vaccinating pregnant women has been hampered by the cyberattack on the HSE’s IT system over the last week.“Maternity units have had to come up with innovative ways to contact women about their vaccine, as they are without access to Patient Information Systems, or the Electronic Health Record that supports the hospitals.“Many maternity hospitals have set up helplines for pregnant women who wish to access this pathway.“Based on the information we have, so far over 12,000 women have had a consultation with their obstetric caregiver about a Covid-19 vaccine.”More than 3,800 women had either received a vaccine or had an appointment for a vaccine to date.Most maternity hospitals and units were discussing Covid-19 vaccines with pregnant women and registering their interest so they could be booked for a jab.Updated information about the Covid-19 vaccine was available on the HSE website –PAEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker what s available in the republic of ireland and what else is coming","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 250,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and more than 4,900 people have died.Globally, over 150 million people have been diagnosed and over 3\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Jannsen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?EMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th.\u0026nbspHow many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2–8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st .On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2–8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?The HSE is currently vaccinating people in the top nine cohorts:\u0026nbsppeople aged 65\u0026nbspand older who live in long-term care facilities (cohort 1), frontline healthcare workers (cohort 2), people aged 70 and older (cohort 3), people aged 16 to 69 who are at very high or high risk (cohort 4 and 7) and those aged 50 to 69 (cohorts 5 and 9).\u0026nbspThe next groups to be offered a vaccine after this will be residents of long-term care facilities aged 16-64 (cohort 8), followed by people aged 64 years and younger, alongside people aged 64 and younger who are living or working in crowded settings.

Arlene Foster descends from her chauffeur-driven Land Rover smiling, even though she has little to smile about.Northern Ireland’s first minister is the latest casualty of Brexit. She has, in her predecessor’s words, been “humiliated” and left as “roadkill” by her own colleagues. These are some of her last hours as leader of the Democratic Unionist party she is due to step down as first minister at the end of June.This year marks a century since the formation of Northern Ireland, and 50 years since the creation of the DUP, its hardline unionist party. Even now, the sharpness of their politics can surprise.A politician since the age of 25, Foster has been a polarising figure in a polarising political set-up. She came to UK prominence in 2017, when former prime minister Theresa May unexpectedly lost her parliamentary majority. The DUP had been seen as a fringe religious relic at Westminster. Suddenly its votes counted. Foster and colleagues extracted £1 billion in public spending in exchange for propping up May’s Conservative government. They were lauded as the master negotiators, the puppetmasters.But Brexit talks did not unfold to their advantage.Foster was outraged by May’s proposals, claiming they detached Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Boris Johnson took over, promised that he wouldn’t betray her, then did. His Brexit deal allowed customs checks in the Irish Sea, and he won a majority for it.By 2020, the DUP’s days of influence were over. Northern Ireland’s businesses and citizens were left with the mess of Brexit bureaucracy and disrupted identity. The DUP’s religious right, angered by Foster’s moderate line on abortion and banning gay conversion therapy, mobilised the ill-feeling to topple her.I don’t agree with the direction of travel under Edwin’s leadership. I think we are regressing and becoming more narrow‘Lacking in strategy’To her critics, Foster is the leader who won the lottery, then tore up the winning ticket. “The art is knowing when to cash your chips in,” says one May supporter. “The DUP could be very adept tacticians, but they were utterly lacking in strategy,” says another. Many unionists can’t understand why the DUP has brought the union into question by supporting a hard Brexit, which most Northern Irish voters opposed.We are meeting in Fermanagh, the county where Foster grew up and still lives, the place that she comes for sanity. Here her influence remains. When I called to book a table for lunch, her chosen restaurant told me that it couldn’t serve lunch – it never serves lunch. Then they discovered that my guest was Foster, and the only questions were what time and any dietary requests. It turns out she supported the restaurant’s planning application. “Constituency work, you know?” she laughs, as we head inside.Fermanagh might offer a glimpse of Northern Ireland’s future. The constituency swings between electing unionists and nationalists. Sinn Féin has recently prevailed.All political careers end in failure, to paraphrase Enoch Powell, whose own political career ended in Northern Ireland. The real question is what happens to the ideas behind them.Neither Northern Ireland nor unionism is in great shape. Petrol bombs were thrown on the streets last month. A narrow majority of Northern Irish voters expect the region to leave the UK within 25 years. English voters like the Union flag, but their desire to accommodate Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales politically is in doubt.Meanwhile, Foster’s successor as DUP leader, Edwin Poots, is a traditionalist who does not believe in evolution. The party has fallen far behind Sinn Féin in polls.“For me, the union is a rational political ideal,” says Foster. She no longer trusts the DUP with it. She plans to leave the party altogether – refusing, extraordinarily, to remain in a club that won’t have her as a leader. Why?“Because I don’t agree with the direction of travel under Edwin’s leadership. I think we are regressing and becoming more narrow. It’s quite nasty, frankly. If the union is to succeed, we need to be a bigger tent . . . The plea I would make to the party is that, if they want to secure the union, then they have to have a wide vision for the union.” She is ready to rage against the dying of the light after all.‘Surprise me’Having a restaurant open especially for you certainly improves the choice of tables. Foster nods to one overlooking the lake, which the French proprietor Pascal assures us is “one of the most beautiful waters in the world for pike”.“I don’t have time to fish,” Foster laughs, before recognising her new reality. “I might be able to go out and fish now!” Pascal offers menus, but we decline. “You’re going to surprise me!” Foster tells him. The chef promises me “something very special”.Ian Paisley, the late founder of the DUP and the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, blasted alcohol as “the devil’s buttermilk”. Foster simply orders a glass of Sauvignon Blanc. She has been the modernising face of the DUP: a professional, a woman, an Anglican. Staunch unionism, however, was never optional.When she was eight, her father – a farmer and policeman – was shot in the head by the IRA. “I have a vivid memory of him crawling into the house on all fours, blood dripping from his head,” she says, tracing a line with a finger just above her eyebrow. Her father survived her mother’s hair turned white overnight.It doesn’t matter if you are a unionist or a nationalist: if you are having to pay extra for something coming from the same country, it can be very distressing.Aged 17, Foster survived a bomb attack on her school bus. Catholic and Protestant pupils rode the bus together but were never friends. It wasn’t until Foster became the first member of her family to go to university that she mixed with the other community.She entered politics as an Ulster Unionist. She opposed the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, in protest at the release of IRA prisoners, and in 2004 defected to the hardline DUP. By 2007 she was a minister. In 2016 she was first minister, sharing power with Sinn Féin.But two things happened almost immediately. First, the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal torched her technocratic image. This was an eco-scheme so badly designed that chicken farmers were paid to install boilers to heat empty sheds. It costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of pounds.An inquiry revealed unrecorded meetings, incompetent officials and politicians unconcerned by wasteful spending because they (wrongly) thought that the UK Treasury was footing the bill. Foster took little responsibility, even though a whistleblower had contacted her with concerns.Then there was Brexit. The DUP was always Eurosceptic: Paisley, ever the anti-Catholic, claimed the European project reflected a “satanic power”. Foster’s stance was less clear. In June 2016, she tweeted more about the European football championship than the referendum. “I had been quite frustrated by state aid rules,” she says. “I wanted Brexit to happen.”But she distances herself from the consequences. “It has been a difficult period,” she tells me.‘Lots more to do’We tuck into our dishes – a medley of mushrooms and mussels for me, a coalition of blue lobster, sea bass and scallops for her. Among the Brexit difficulties were meetings with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator. “He used to start off very suave in English, and then we would start about how this was disgraceful, and then he’d get angrier and angrier, until he started to speak in French!”What most rankles about the Brexit deal, she says, is that parcels from Britain now arrive with customs declarations. “It doesn’t matter if you are a unionist or a nationalist: if you are having to pay extra for something coming from the same country, it can be very distressing.”A 19-year-old loyalist representative, Joel Keys, told MPs this month that violence could not be taken off the table. “When you hear somebody as young as that talking about violence, it really does set you back in your shoes. We have lots more to do, especially in urban working-class areas.”On Brexit, her solution is that the protocol, which creates a special post-Brexit status for Northern Ireland, be altered “in a very fundamental way. There’s no point in tinkering around with it.“Look, I don’t doubt that Theresa’s a unionist and Boris is a unionist, but when it comes to a choice, we were the people who had to be sacrificed. Boris was almost myopic in his desire to get Brexit done.”Surely she has at least learnt not to trust the prime minister? He now literally has a bridge to sell her, connecting Northern Ireland and Scotland. Does she believe he will build it? “I hope so. It’s a tunnel now, is it not?” Come on, I say. She laughs. “He told me last Thursday that he was talking to the engineers in the afternoon. He wants to be Isambard Kingdom Brunel!”If the protocol is so bad, does she regret not toppling May in 2018? “No, because we did achieve quite a lot for Northern Ireland through the confidence-and-supply agreement. We are going to have the best broadband infrastructure in the whole of the UK.”So was there anything the DUP could have done differently? Foster exhales, and blames May for accepting there could be no Irish border checks. “All of the reasons I voted for Brexit are still good reasons. The difficulty has been the way in which the protocol has been worked through. And I think the Irish Government has a lot to answer for.”As I carve into some courgette, I recall Foster’s reason for leaving the Ulster Unionists in 2004 – that, time and time again, every problem was seen as “someone else’s fault”.“That was just beautiful,” Foster calls out to Pascal, her plate empty but for a broccoli stalk.A miserable familyThe DUP portrays itself as a family. Recent weeks have shown it to be a miserable one. Senior members circulated a letter of no confidence in Foster, but never gave it to her. Blindsided, she surrendered anyway. “There was a different way of doing it, but they chose to go in a very public way.”When Foster became first minister in 2016, Poots said her most important job would remain “that of a wife, mother and daughter”. How did she interpret that? “Well, how would you interpret it?” I know how my mother would interpret it: she’d be pretty annoyed. “Yeah . . . I’ve had everyday sexism since – women in politics just have to get on with things. But it was a very pointed remark.” Did he apologise? “Not at all.”Would her ousting have been different if she were a man? “I don’t know, I can’t answer that.” She has also fought a libel case over false internet claims that she has had an affair with a protection officer, winning £125,000 in damages.Coffee and profiteroles have arrived. The gentle landscape outside belies the political reality. Northern Ireland has survived a century because a majority of residents, and the British government, have underwritten it. But there are cracks. In the Stormont assembly, unionists no longer have a majority. One possibility is that Sinn Féin becomes the largest party at the next election, and the DUP refuses to serve under a Sinn Féin first minister. Is there a problem coming down the track? “There is – a real problem,” says Foster.Her own perceived intransigence over Brexit burnt through goodwill in the British Conservative party. Public spending in Northern Ireland is 20 per cent higher than the UK average, while public revenues are 16 per cent lower.“I know people in England sometimes get upset when they see how much subvention goes to Scotland and to Northern Ireland . . . We need to articulate why the union’s important.”I point out Foster is roughly as old as David Cameron when he left office. “I don’t know Lex Greensill!” she laughs. Would she accept a seat in the House of Lords? “I haven’t been offered a seat in the Lords, so I’ll wait to see what happens.” She also wants to encourage more women into politics.Splitting the billFoster is good company – not as grand as she is sometimes labelled. But after two hours with her, I can understand why the May government found her so hard to read. She talks reconciliation, then snaps back. She doesn’t quite engage, doesn’t quite take responsibility for the realities of where her policies have led. I sense that inviting Foster to lunch is one thing trying to split the bill with her would be another.Afternoon sun warms the table.“The local estate agents were telling me it’s crazy the amount of people looking for homes in the countryside,” says Foster, twiddling her napkin. “Compared to where Northern Ireland was in the Seventies and Eighties, it is such a joy to live in it now.”In 2011, a policeman called Ronan Kerr was murdered by dissident republicans. Foster’s middle child was aged 12. “He said: ‘Why would someone kill a policeman, mummy? I don’t understand.’ And I just thought, wow! When I was growing up, policemen were being killed, innocent people were being killed all the time.”Half of young voters identify as neither nationalist nor unionist. For politicians such as Foster, whose childhoods were marked by the Troubles, compromise has always been tinged with fear. “Reconciliation has happened, maybe not at the political level, but at the grassroots,” she says.A new generation has a task ahead. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 reopening measures set to see large degree of normality return over summer","story":"Announcing the widespread reopening of the economy and society, Mr Martin said that “after the trauma of the last 15 months, we are finally taking definite steps towards enjoying normal times. Video: RTETaoiseach Micheál Martin said the easing of restrictions was an important step forward but that the coming month could be ‘the most important test’ in the fight against the pandemic. Photograph: Julien BehalPA A far-reaching lifting of Covid-19 restrictions was announced on Friday night by Taoiseach Micheál Martin, who unveiled a schedule for admitting crowds to sporting and cultural events, reopening hospitality businesses and permitting foreign travel over the coming months that is both faster and broader than previously expected.The measures will see a large degree of normality gradually return to social and commercial life over the summer.In a televised address from Government Buildings, Mr Martin cautioned that the coming month could be “the most important test” in the fight against the pandemic but if people continued to observe the remaining restrictions and to take the vaccine, “the end of this is within our grasp”.But Mr Martin also sounded a warning: “Change brings risk. We still have a journey to go with our vaccination programme, and we are monitoring very closely what impact new variants, especially the B1617 “Indian” variant has on the spread of the virus.“But subject to us continuing to make progress,” he said, “we will move to the next phase of reopening.”He went on to say that the planned reopening schedule of June would go ahead as planned, with a number of additional elements, mainly relating to attendance at events. There will also be a series of test events that will be allowed to admit larger crowds.Mr Martin went on to lay out a programme for further reopening in June, July and August.These include the reopening of outdoor hospitality, cinemas and theatres, sports matches, gyms and swimming pools and amusement parks .In July indoor pubs and restaurants will reopen, while rules governing the numbers allowed to attend gatherings in private homes, and organised events will also be relaxed. International travel will resume on July 19.Subject to the continued rollout of the vaccine and the suppression of the virus, August will see another stage in the reopening.From August 5th there will be a further increase in numbers attending indoor events, with 200 in larger venues and 100 in all others. The current 50 per cent capacity restriction on public transport will be lifted and up to 100 guests will be able to attend weddings.The Taoiseach indicated that there could also be a further relaxation of the limits of people attending outdoor sporting events.In a press conference hosted with Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan, Mr Martin said people would be asked to continue to work from home, saying this was based on public health advice. Mr Varadkar said there could be a staggered return to offices in August, but the Government’s current target was that offices should reopen in September. Mr Varadkar also questioned reports that there was widespread fraud related to the pandemic unemployment payment.Mr Ryan said it was “a good news day for the people of our country”.Asked about the risks of reopening, Mr Martin said Nphet had advised the Government that the measures represented “low-to-medium” risk.“Yes, there was a caveat put in in relation to the Indian variant,” he said.He said that an “ad hoc group” of senior officials had been set up “to closely monitor the Indian variant here and the UK.”“There’s no point in saying there’s not risk, there is risk there,” he said.While just 20 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated now, it is understood the head of the high-level task vaccine Brian MacCraith told Thursday’s Cabinet sub-committee that at least 2.5m people will be fully vaccinated in Ireland in July. It could even be closer to three million people, sources said.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"end of pandemic within grasp says taoiseach as easing of covid 19 restrictions confirmed","story":"Announcing the widespread reopening of the economy and society, Mr Martin said that “after the trauma of the last 15 months, we are finally taking definite steps towards enjoying normal times. Video: RTE Taoiseach Micheál Martin at Government Buildings, Dublin The end of the pandemic is within grasp if the country can remain vigilant and “continue to make the right choices”, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said on Friday evening.In an address to the nation at Government Buildings, Mr Martin said that “after the trauma of the last 15 months, we are finally taking definite steps towards enjoying normal times with friends and loved ones again.”Announcing the widespread reopening of the economy and society, Mr Martin said: “we’re almost back to a point where we can just enjoy the ordinary extraordinary moments in our lives.”“The sense of hope, excitement, and relief is palpable. But as we watch what is happening across the globe, we of course know that we must remain vigilant against this terrible virus. We know there have been many twists and turns on this journey.“I’ve talked many times about the strength that is found and solidarity and how managing the pandemic must be a collective effort. This coming month could be the most important test of that spirit that we have faced since this ordeal began.”“If we continue to mind each other, if we continue to make the right choices, be vigilant, take our vaccine when our turn comes, if we continue to do all of these things, the end of this is within our grasp,” he said.Mr Martin asked the public to continue to exercise caution and “to trust the science.” He said that while the Government’s approach has been cautious, “the strategy is working.”VaccinationThe vaccination portal will now open for everyone over 40 next week, he confirmed.“By every measure, the Irish people trust the vaccines. In fact, our country enjoys one of the highest levels of trust in the vaccine in the world.“Almost 100 per cent of our citizens over the age of 70 are now fully vaccinated. This is unsurpassed in the European Union. This strategy is working.”“Now the challenge is to keep moving forward, safely, remembering all the time our determination to make sure that when we reopen each part of our society and economy, it stays open.”It is understood that the Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly told Cabinet earlier on Friday that the Government is to revise its vaccination target downwards. It had been expected that 82 per cent of adults would be given at least one vaccine by the end of June. This will now be revised to the mid-70 per cent range, it is understood.Speaking at a briefing following Mr Martin’s announcement, the three Government leaders emphasised the high volume of vaccinations, which were continuing at a rate of 300,000 per week.Mr Varadkar said that 2.5 million people will be fully vaccinated by the end of July, according to the projections of the High Level Task Force on Covid-19 Vaccination.Restaurants, bars, hotels and eventsFrom July 5th indoor service will recommence in restaurants and bars.The Taoiseach confirmed that from June 2nd, hotels and guesthouses would reopen and that from June 7th, outdoor hospitality would recommence.On restaurants, the Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said he understood where the Restaurant Association was coming from with its challenge but the rationale of the Government had always been a phased reopening. That approach, he said, meant that it was outdoor dining first, and then indoor dining.“They point out the anomaly that hotels are allowed to serve residents in dining rooms but that has always been the case even under Level 5. We have never made people eat their meals in their bedrooms.”He said that restaurants and bars, even though open for outdoor dining throughout June, would still get paid the weekly Covid Restrictions Support Scheme payment (worth up to €5,000 per week) as if they were closed.“Then there will be a bullet payment in July,” he said, adding that hotels would not get those payments.Mr Martin said from June 7th up to 200 people could attend outdoor events in venues with a minimum capacity of 5,000 and 100 could attend other outdoor events. Cinema and theatres can also reopen.In light of concerns around road safety, there would be a recommencement of theory tests. There will also be an incremental reopen of driver test centres.“I really want to emphasise one key point. Continued progress is not inevitable. Change brings risk. We still have a journey to go with our vaccination programme, and we are monitoring very closely what impact new variants, especially the B1617 Indian variant has under spread of the virus. But subject to us continuing to make progress, we will move to the next phase of reopening,” he said.Indoor events will recommence from July 5th with a maximum of 100 attendees in larger venues and 50 in all others.“We will see a further increase in the numbers attending outdoor events, indoor exercise and sports activities will return and there will be further relaxation on visits to private homes, and up to 50 guests will be able to attend wedding receptions,” Mr Martin said.Furthermore, from August 5th there will be a further increase in numbers attending indoor events with 200 in larger venues and 100 in all others.The 50 per cent capacity restriction on public transport will be lifted and up to 100 guests will be able to attend weddings.“Our direction of travel is clear, and it’s very positive. To continue in this direction, it is important that we all adhere to public health guidelines and make sensible personal decisions.”Throughout June and July, test matches and concerts will be held around the country.The Cabinet also agreed to allow fans to attend a number of sports fixtures and music events throughout the summer. These are understood to include the Leinster v Dragons rugby game at the RDS on June 11th.Fans also may attend another game, Shamrock Rovers v Finn Harps, on the same day, as well as the Cork City v Cabinteely match. The Liberty Insurance Camogie League final at Croke Park on June 20th may also have fans in the stadium.Spectators could also be present at the Irish Life Health National Senior Championships on June 26th and at the Shamrock Rovers vs Drogheda match on June 25th . Spectators may also attend racing at the Curragh.The Government’s plan for outdoor gigs is as follows: an outdoor musical festival in the Phoenix Park on the 26th of June, fully seated with 3,500 in attendance. An outdoor music event on the 10th of June in the Iveagh Gardens curated by the National Concert Hall with 500 people in attendance. Outside of Dublin there two more music events planned one on the 26th June at the INEC Club in Killarney which will be a music performance that will be fully seated with 200 people.From June 7th, a maximum of 100 people can attend matches rising to 200 at venues that can accommodate 5,000 or more.This will rise from July 5th, to 200 at matches or 500 where there is a capacity of 5,000 or more.From August, up to 500 spectators can attend matches, or in larger venues 5000 or 25 per cent of capacity, whichever is smaller.Mr Donnelly said the Cabinet was looking “very carefully” at how to facilitate travel between Ireland and Britain.TravelOn international travel, Mr Martin said: “I understand the pent-up desire of very many people to have a break overseas or to welcome friends and family from abroad. But I also understand very clearly the need to get this right and to make sure that we restore international travel in a safe and sustainable way.“At my most recent meeting with European leaders last week, we confirmed our support for the European Union digital Covid-19 certificate for travel within the European Union. Today at Government we agreed to fully operate that scheme from the 19th of July. This will facilitate a return to international travel in accordance with clear safety protocols.”From July 5th, up to three households can gather together with another household regardless of vaccination status.Passengers will be allowed to travel throughout the EU without facing mandatory hotel quarantine on their return from July 19th.Minister for Transport Eamon Ryan told a briefing after Mr Martin’s announcement that although there will be different regimes for travel from the US and UK to the EU digital green pass system, the “same broad approach will apply”.Mr Ryan said that non-essential travel will reopen from the US and the UK when flights to EU States begin to reopen in mid-July.Mr Ryan said that both countries would become designated third countries and said the UK was a “very close and important neighbour to us”.The Minister was speaking at a press conference in Government Buildings on the Cabinet’s decision to reopen society during the course of the summer.He said concerns had been expressed in Britain in relation to the variants of concern (the Indian variant) that are the dominant strain there.“We will require people arriving from Great Britain to self-quarantine at home unless they have been fully vaccinated. We will keep this under review and I hope, later in the summer, we will be able to open up further the common travel area we have the privilege of sharing with the UK.”He said mandatory hotel quarantine would be retained for what he said would be a very small number of countries. Mr Ryan also confirmed that children travelling abroad with parents would require a PCR test in order to get a digital certificate.“It will only be used in relation to variants of concern,” he said.Working from homeMr Varadkar said that the national economic recovery plan announced next week, including €900 million in EU funding, would help to “make sure as many businesses as possible survive the period ahead.”He said that in relation to some businesses in the events sector, including nightclubs, he understood they would be disappointed they have not yet been allowed to reopen. “They will not be forgotten,” he said.He said that 25,000 people have left the Pandemic Unemployment Payments in the past week and people were going back to work in big numbers. He said any withdrawal of PUP would be gradual.Responding to a question from The , the Taoiseach confirmed that the public health advice for people to work from home had not changed.“The public health advice is strongly of the view that people work from home where it is possible. That advice is as strong as ever.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"everything you need to know about what is reopening","story":"The Government on Friday confirmed the nature of the easing of restrictions in the next few months. Photograph: iStockThe Cabinet has ordered the largest-yet reopening of the State, and to allow the resumption of international travel. Here is your guide to everything you need to know about the summer ahead.JuneHospitality: Hotels will reopen their doors next week on June 2nd for the first time all year. If you have made a booking, you will be permitted to dine and drink indoors.At present the guidelines state that if tables are more than two metres apart there will not be a time limit. But if they are less than two metres apart, Fáilte Ireland guidelines say that you must pre-book and the sitting is limited to 105 minutes plus 15 minutes for cleaning time.The following week, on Monday, June 7th, outdoor dining will return with no distinction for pubs that serve food and pubs that do not. If a pub has an outdoor area, they can reopen.For outdoor dining, just one metre will be needed between tables, with a maximum of six people aged over 13 at a table, or 15 in total if the group includes children.When it comes to having people in your own home, you can have one other household visit indoors regardless of vaccination status.Cinemas: On the same date of June 7th, film fans can return to the cinema, but there will be limits set on how many can sit in each theatre. Gyms, pools and leisure centres will reopen for inidual training, plus swimming lessonsMatches: A number of test events will be held throughout June and July with spectators back at matches. In June this includes the Leinster v Dragons match at the RDS on June 11th, the LOI Shamrock Rovers v Finn Harps match on June 11th and the League of Ireland Cork City v Cabinteely match on the same date.Racing fans will also be allowed back to the Curragh at the end of June, the Camogie league final on June 20th in Croke park and the Shamrock Rovers vs Drogheda match on June 26th. Fans will also attend the Morton Stadium National Athletics Championships on June 26th. In terms of the sizes at these matches, a maximum of 100 people can attend rising to 200 at venues that can accommodate 5,000 or more.Concerts: In terms of concerts, the Government’s plan for outdoor gigs is as follows: an outdoor musical festival will be held in the Phoenix Park on the 26th of June which will be fully seated with 3,500 in attendance. An outdoor concert on June 10th at the Iveagh Gardens in Dublin will be run by the National Concert Hall for 500 guests.Outside of Dublin, there will be two tests concerts planned: one on June at the INEC Club in Killarney, for 200 people seated. The other will be an opera performance on June 23rd at the University Limerick Concert Hall for 500 people.Weddings: A couple can have up to 25 guests at their wedding reception from June 7th.JulyHospitality: Under the new plan, indoor hospitality for pubs and restaurants resumes on Monday July 5th. The numbers who can into your home jumps, too, with three households permitted to gather.Travel: International travel resumes from July 19th when Ireland signs up to the EU Covid-19 Cert also known as the “EU green cert”, though the existing Government advice to avoid non-essential travel, and the related penalties that come alongside that, will remain in place until 18 July. From 19 July this will be changed to advise citizens to travel safely and in accordance with public health guidance and restrictions and to avoid non-essential travel to countries to which an “emergency brake” has been applied.Matches: The list of pilot events for sports in July includes the Irish Golf Open in Mount Juliet in Kilkenny. There will be spectators when Shamrock Rovers take on Dundalk in Tallaght Stadium on July 2nd and the next day fans can attend the Ireland vs Japan rugby match at the Aviva Stadium as well as the Cork vs Limerick Munster GAA hurling semi-final.On July 4th there will be spectators at the Roscommon vs Galway GAA football championships.

Video: RTETaoiseach Micheál Martin shimmies down the red carpet to deliver the good news to the nation on Friday. Handout photograph: Julien Behal Photography It was Micheál’s shimmiest shimmy yet down the red carpet.He couldn’t wait to deliver the good news.And it was very thoughtful of the Taoiseach to bundle all the media spoilers together into one easily accessible Mickyleaks speech. It had been increasingly difficult to keep track as every detail of the Grand Reopening was drip-fed to journalists in recent days.Micheál Martin’s latest television address to the nation was imbued with hope and optimism. The Taoiseach looked and sounded more relaxed than he has at any other time since taking over the top job in the teeth of a pandemic. As he ran through his script, there was a real feeling that a corner has been turned.He rattled through the dates and figures. The numbers came thick and fast in a speech which required little padding. In a strong indication that the end is in sight, there were no galvanising noises about the spirit bravely enduring and there was no need to warble about wintering out, tiding over or leaning in.“The sense of hope, excitement and relief is palpable,” declared Micheál.And for the rest of us, details of the gradual opening up of society came as a relief too.The new rules were all a bit bewildering as he doled out a nourishing number soup of how many can go where and do what and when. How many at a wedding? How long to eat inside and how long to drink outside? What size table and do the children count as extra or go free?And then he said 200 people will be able to congregate at an event. Wonderful. But that would be 200 people in a venue designed for a minimum of 5,000. If nothing else, that will give the lucky ticket-holders an idea what it’s like to be a TD in the Dublin Convention Centre.Gigs and games are on the way back and by August people will be able to pile onto trains and buses again and complain about the experience. The only difference will be people taking off their face masks instead of putting their bag on the adjoining seat before the journey starts to discourage anyone from sitting next to them.The vaccine rollout is going really well, Micheál stressed, so barring any nasty surprises the reopening should go well.Nobody will catch Covid and die. Unfortunately, there will be thousands of casualties after the stampedes to get tickets to the “pilot events”.“After the trauma of the last 15 months, we are finally taking definite steps toward enjoying normal times with our friends and loved ones again. We are almost back to a point where we can just enjoy the ordinary, extraordinary moments in our lives,” smiled the Taoiseach, sounding like an Ikea advert.But seldom is wonderful. After the speech, he was joined by an equally upbeat Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan. The mood threatened to turn giddy, but they managed to remain keep things low-key.There is a long way to go. But a long time has passed.It felt good when Micheál Martin finally got to say these words: “The end of this is within our grasp.”Let them eat birthday cakeThere was no party.(There hasn’t been a party since the end of 2008, but that’s another story.)Former tánaiste and Progressive Democrats leader Michael McDowell is 70 today. The university Senator and senior counsel was keeping quiet about approaching this milestone birthday on Saturday, but word got out because it’s hard to keep anything a secret in Leinster House.When he nipped down to the self-service canteen on Friday to collect some lunch, kitchen manager Julie Lyons surprised him with a special cake to mark the occasion.It was a large Victoria sponge decorated with fondant icing and sprinkles, and featured a picture of the soon-to-be septuagenarian flanked by the two statues of Nubian princesses which stand outside the Shelbourne Hotel. McDowell was part of a high-profile campaign for their reinstatement last year after management removed them in the mistaken belief they were associated with slavery.Because of social distancing requirements, the cake was presented and accepted at arm’s length. A slightly embarrassed but delighted Senator McDowell brought it to his office before returning it to the canteen minus a large chunk. It was carved up and left out for people to bring back a slice back to their desks as all tables and chairs have been removed from the canteen.Having discovered the former minister for justice was not the only birthday boy from the Upper House, Julie then rustled up a big muffin in a cup for Independent Senator Victor Boyhan, who recently turned 60. Victor was also a member of the PDs, back in the day.There was no fighting over the crumbs.There are rumours that a birthday video has been made featuring scurrilous contributions from a erse selection of Oireachtas members. But that’s another Leinster House secret.Changing with the seasonsIt’s been hard to keep track of the twists and turns in the Covid cycle of political policy and positioning.Urgent and angry demands for the Government to adopt a specific strategy suddenly melt away, replaced in short order by urgent and angry demands to do something entirely different.While Government TDs were lukewarm last Wednesday on the troubling continuation of undiluted emergency powers until at least November, they also accused the Opposition of inconsistent and opportunistic behaviour at a time of crisis.“We have seen some parties in the House today take wildly different views on the Covid strategy,” said Fianna Fáil’s Cormac Devlin. “One week they’re calling for us to follow the Nphet advice, the next they’re calling for zero-Covid strategy while recently demanding universal mandatory hotel quarantine for all travellers to Ireland. From one extreme to the other, they’re like an autumn leaf in the wind. They’re constantly blowing around and coming up with different strategies.”Bríd Smith of People Before Profit pulled him up on his analogy.“Cormac Devlin said the Opposition are like autumn leaves blowing in the wind. I don’t know if he thinks he’s Frank Sinatra or something,” she noted, outlining her outright opposition to the extension of the emergency powers. “If he passes this legislation what he’ll be like is somebody who has forgotten that there are several seasons. He wants to go from early summer and late spring, straight into the winter and allow these draconian measures bring us right up to the end of November 2021. We are not having it.”Speaking of leaves in the wind, Sinn Féin’s Louise O’Reilly was full of bluster on Virgin Media’s Tonight Show on Wednesday night when Fine Gael junior Minister Colm Brophy took a sideswipe at her party. He remarked sweetly while holding forth on the need to safely reintroduce aviation:”I know Louise’s party wanted to, at one stage, close down the entire country, to every county, and quarantine everyone arriving...” he began.Louise jumped in with a passionate interruption. “That’s not true, Colm,” she indignantly cried as he kept talking. “That’s not true!” she insisted again. “That’s not true!”“As we know, Nphet first called for quarantine to be examined back in May of last year. I was calling for that myself and this is something which could and should have been done quicker... Obviously we welcome the fact there is any quarantine but this does not go far enough and that is the anger that people are feeling at the moment.“And that is the fear – that they are doing their best, that people are doing their best, that they are limiting their contacts, that they are ensuring they don’t move more than five kilometres from their home, that they are following all of the guidelines.“But they feel let down by the Government, who are not enforcing mandatory quarantine into the State and I think that that has to be done, I am not alone in thinking that...”Which might explain the memory lapse.Sticking to ConventionTDs anxious to abandon €20,000-plus a day Dublin Convention Centre for a return to Leinster House were disappointed to learn this week that it is unlikely to happen this side of September.The Business Committee (overwhelmingly in favour of the move) met Leinster House authorities on Thursday to decide on the move. While the deputies argued strongly for a resumption of business in Kildare Street, senior Oireachtas officials strongly recommended against it on grounds of health and safety.The Ceann Comhairle, Seán Ó Fearghaíl, and the clerk of the Dáil, Peter Finnegan, backed the proposal to stay in the Convention Centre.The politicians wanted to meet in Leinster House on Tuesdays and Thursdays, continuing sittings in the Convention Centre on Wednesday to allow for block voting. This was shot down by the officials. The TDs then suggested one day back in Leinster House, but that too was rejected.When the matter was put to a vote, Sinn Féin and the Social Democrats voted to move, but representatives of the other parties were reluctant to go against the health and safety advice.Earlier in the week, the Fine Gael parliamentary party voted in favour of a motion from Michael Ring calling for resumption of sittings in Leinster House.Pádraig Mac Lochlainn, the Sinn Féin whip, says he is not going to let go of the issue and will be pressing again at the next committee meeting for a partial return to Leinster House by the Dáil’s 160 TDs.“I genuinely can’t accept the advice,” he says. “Everyone is already working out of Leinster House. The car park is absolutely jammers, front and back. The TDs are here anyway. They leave to go to the Convention Centre when they have to speak and then they come right back again.”But it looks like our L’Oréal Sur Liffey (because they’re worth it) is set to remain until the House rises for summer in mid-July."},{"url":null,"title":"what is the eu digital covid certificate for travelling","story":"While the digital Covid certificate  system  is set for formal launch on July 1st, Greece has announced  it is ready to use the system earlier as it is keen to start its summer tourism season. Photograph: Getty ImagesWhat is the EU digital Covid certificate?The digital Covid certificate is aimed to help EU residents demonstrate whether they have been vaccinated when travelling within the bloc. The system has been developed at the insistence of member states that are economically reliant on tourism in the hope it will help to ease travel restrictions.How will the system work?The free certificate will be a scannable QR code that travellers can show on a piece of paper or on their phones, similar to the airport boarding passes familiar from pre-pandemic times.It is designed to include people who have not been vaccinated as well: it can also show if you have tested negative for Covid-19 or if you have had the illness and recovered.The certificate is not mandatory for travellers. It remains up to each member state to set their own Covid-19 health policies, and therefore to choose whether to treat vaccinated people that arrive in their country differently to non-vaccinated people.Some countries will choose to exempt vaccinated people from requirements such as to undergo a Covid-19 test or quarantine, particularly if they want to attract tourists. Some EU countries have begun to already exempt vaccinated arrivals from restrictions, including Croatia, Greece, and from June 7th, Spain.People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their final dose.When will it go live?The system is currently being trialled, and is set for formal launch on July 1st, though countries can choose to link in later. Greece has announced that it is ready to use the system earlier as it is keen to start its summer tourism season. Ireland is to join on July 19th.How is data treated?In order to link up to the system national healthcare systems must collect vaccination data in a standard format so that they can issue the certificates for their residents.The data that the certificates must contain includes name, date of birth, date of issuance, date of vaccine received, test or recovery from Covid-19, and a unique identifier.The information is not stored in a central EU database, but remains kept in each country’s national healthcare system. The digital architecture the EU has built essentially provides a way for this data to be presented in a code that can be read and understood in any of the 27 countries when travellers arrive.What vaccines are accepted?The vaccines approved by the European Medicines Agency (AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson \u0026amp Johnson) are automatically accepted. Member states can choose to also accept vaccines that are not approved by the European Medicines Agency. Some of these have been used within the EU, such as Russia’s Sputnik and China’s Sinopharm in Hungary.What about travel beyond the EU?The European Commission says it is “working with the World Health Organisation to ensure that certificates issued in the EU can be recognised elsewhere in the world as well”.What about Northern Ireland?The State’s HSE has the responsibility of issuing Covid-19 digital vaccination certificates for residents of the Republic. Eligibility for vaccination throughout the EU is generally linked to where you have a social insurance or healthcare number, in Ireland’s case a PPS number.The European Commission has said that countries outside the EU could choose to join the system but this appears to be unlikely in the case of the UK. That means it will be up to each member state to set policy on how to treat travellers who have been vaccinated through the UK National Health Service.The NHS has a Covid app that can be used as a certificate: cabinet minister Michael Gove announced this week that the countries that have agreed to accept it as proof of vaccination now include Barbados, Croatia, Greece, Turkey, Gibraltar, Iceland, Moldova, Bulgaria, and Estonia.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons may 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Who is next on the list for Covid vaccines - and how will I be invited to book an appointment?\u0026#39War injuries like a disease\u0026#39 says world-renowned British Palestinian reconstructive surgeon on latest visit to GazaCoronavirus latest news: Crowds take advantage of eased restrictions flocking to coast and city venues on bank holidayVietnam detects new hybrid of Indian and UK Covid-19 variantTime\u0026#39s up for Pimm’s o’clock as drinkers prefer Aldi versionComment: Reform of the BBC must start at the very topComment: Where is Hugh Grant\u0026#39s condemnation of the BBC\u0026#39s unethical actions? NHS wants ban on sale of magnetic balls after Tik Tok trend leaves children in hospitalSaturday morning UK news briefing: Today\u0026#39s top headlines from The Covid lockdown roadmap: the latest rules and news on June 21 reopeningUK weather: Blue skies, sunshine and hottest day of the year forecast for bank holiday Sasha Johnson: Teenager charged over shooting of BLM activistUsman Khan: The 40 missed warning signs on Fishmongers’ Hall attackerWoman found guilty of starving millionaire landowner to deathBoris Johnson \u0026#39refused to send\u0026#39 Carrie Symonds\u0026#39 letter of complaint about their dogComment: Wuhan puts paid to Cummings’ idea of how to manage a public health crisisBoris Johnson will be forced to decide on child Covid vaccinationsExclusive: Only a fifth of English voters oppose Scottish independence,  poll revealsDominic Cummings accused of \u0026#39sabotaging\u0026#39 mass testing that could have averted care homes crisisExclusive: Britain risks becoming a ‘liability’ unless we keep up with the US, says Army chiefBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britains x files governments ufo hunters may restart search","story":"The Government may relaunch a team of UFO hunters in the wake of a US report into alien visitors, a senior defence source has revealed.Ever since the Ministry of Defence\u0027s dedicated UFO desk was disbanded in 2009, no agency has been responsible for monitoring the skies over Britain for unidentified flying objects. However, depending on the findings of a Pentagon report into UFOs, which have been renamed Unidentified Aerial Phenomena, there is every possibility that the department could be revived.Speaking exclusively to The , the source said: I think that if there was enough evidence to suggest that there was something, and that we needed to do it as well as the US, then of course we\u0027d think about it. We\u0027d look at it. There\u0027s all sorts of things that we wouldn\u0027t rule out, and this would certainly be one of them.The source pointed to RAF Fylingdales, which tracks objects in space, as a current means to work with the US and others to see if you can identify if there are more of these phenomena around.It comes as the US Congress will next month be given an unclassified report on evidence collected by the Pentagon\u0027s UAP Task Force, the Office of Naval Intelligence and the FBI, something Ufologists are hailing as a watershed moment.Earlier this month, Lord Black asked the Government whether it has had any role in the US\u0027s Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force and what contact and information exchange it has had with the body if it has had no such role.Baroness Goldie, a defence minister, said the UK does not have a role in the Task Force and that although the MoD is aware of the planned report, it has not contributed to it.She added that the department would be unable to provide any comments on the report ahead of its official release by the US government.Nick Pope investigated UFOs for the MoD in a ision known as the Secretariat Airstaff, which was launched by Sir Winston Churchill in 1953. Mr Pope\u0027s duties included investigating UFOs, but he told The  those duties were less Mulder and Scully and more process driven.He said: The reality of Government UFO investigation was not quite that glamorous. We did not run around darkened warehouses with torches out and guns drawn.It was all a little bit more bureaucratic – it was like, here\u0027s a UFO sighting, let\u0027s check the radar tapes with the air force experts. Here\u0027s a video, let\u0027s get it to the intelligence community imagery analyst. After the UFO desk closed down in 2009, anyone who spots a potential UFO must report it to the local police.An MoD spokesman said that in over 50 years, no UFO report has revealed any evidence of a potential threat to the United Kingdom. However, Mr Pope said it was a huge mistake to stop investigating UFOs, adding: I think the people taking the decision allowed themselves to be unduly influenced by pop culture. They had in their heads the phrase UFO and made false equivalency of alien space ships, and therefore this was a waste of taxpayers time and money.They should have said if there\u0027s something unexplained in our airspace we should want to know what it is, particularly when it’s been seen from time to time by our own pilots and tracked on civil and military radar.He added that the Government\u0027s failure was to treat UFOs as some science fiction that triggers the giggle factor rather than as a serious defence and national security issue, which is precisely the current mindset of the United States, and they\u0027ve got it spot on.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"split woke explains everything political divide","story":"Invoking the word woke has the same power as using the magic Marmite word Meghan Markle, or indeed “racism” - once uttered, the Britons before you part much like the Red Sea before Moses: either spewing that “we should be ever-woke to the racism that stalks our every step”, or mourning that the “the woke put everything down to racism these days!”. Unsurprising, then, that a poll of Britons this week found that as many think “woke” is a compliment (26 per cent) as think it’s an insult (24 per cent). The finding will, however, shock many on the Left, who had coined the word woke to indicate being “right-on”, aware of all that is wrong in this bad, bad world, its myriad injustices, racial and otherwise - and in the case of my friends in their twenties, assumed its definition had remained as such, untouched through the ages. Hence their despair at those who are anti-woke - how can you be opposed to something so uncontroversial as awareness? Yet everyone I know over thirty, particularly my parents’ generation - thought everyone knew woke indicated being pedantic to the point of foolishness and thus are somewhat puzzled by those who proudly badge themselves as woke. Of course, this misunderstanding over “woke” creates perfect fodder for those who do understand to whip up resentment and stoke the political polarisation self-proclaimed Marxists can point at centrist dads expressing reservations around wokeness (“wokeness is anti-racism, therefore they are pro-racism!”), while Laurence Fox can straw-man sneer at the pomposity of those proud to be “woke”. The algorithms reinforce the ide by leeching off the extremity of statements about wokeness, propelled by likes and hates which are, bizarrely, hinge on two entirely different understandings of their meaning. That the political ide we are currently experiencing falls neatly along the lines of the woke ide is striking the proportion of Tories and Brexiteers who consider woke a compliment is 12 and 13 per cent - while 36 and 37 per cent of Labour supporters and Remainers consider it a compliment.It is no wonder, therefore, that the report described “culture wars” as a “top-down, elite-driven phenomenon”: The war over woke is just a microcosm of a wider ide in understanding, which everyone from Trump to Ash Sarkar uses to ruffle and rouse the troops in all matters identity politics.The Left view racism as structural, baked-in - which is why statues and micro-aggressions and National Trust slavery links - which feel silly and sanctimonious to many Tories - are fundamental to the fight for equality.   All of what is ostensibly just swirly Bachelor-of-Arts bunkum - language, history - has real and important consequences for our everyday. It\u0027s like when we realised about twenty years ago that saying women should be able to do what men can do wasn\u0027t really enough - we all - women included - might have subtle, sexist expectations which we had to actively think about.But at its extremes,  wokeness can mean expecting everyone to be virgin-on-wedding-night pure on 21st century issues - even if they were born a good 500 years ago. And so, cancel culture can result in a Reductio ad Hitlerum - believing any oppression experienced is comparable to that of the Holocaust — and therefore that you can label your opponent a Nazi (although, ironically, in the case of Israel, anti-Semitism is often given a free pass) - not quite the original, noble aims of wokeness. Many on the Left believe the Right do not see racism as a “very bad thing”, because, as the rallying call goes “it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be anti-racist”. And it turns out being “anti-racist requires quite a few actions.And this is precisely what has befuddled many Tory voters - those Hartlepoolians, for example. It’s not that - as much of Leftie analysis would have you believe - that they don’t care about refugees or Palestinians. It’s more that they believe in being decent to your neighbours first and foremost - after all, they happen to know Jill from over the road a bit better than anyone in the Middle East - just the way people do more for their kids than other people’s kids. Nothing against black lives matter, more unease with Black Lives Matter (caps) and defunding police officers.A sense that a media luvvie of colour railing against “white privilege” feels a bit dubious when you’re a white working-class cleaner, conversations about “intersectionality” and “cisgender” feel a bit scholastic, removed - and discourse about permafrost thawing in 2050 feels a bit indulgent when your kitchen is flooded right now.  Conservatives tend to think, to the surprise of many, that racism is very much a bad thing. But they think there are other problems too - and doesn’t taking the knee, going on about black vs white, just feel a bit like the opposite of what we were meant to be doing moving away from the idea of skin colour mattering one jot?But to admit that we are speaking a different language - whether on wokery or racism would not serve the social media stars well - the followers mustn’t be allowed to translate! After all, it wouldn’t do their ratings any good to try to resolve a problem through any sort of dialogue or common ground - better to cheapen the opposing argument, and score political points. Who cares about keeping a rally up, or the thousands in the stands getting anything out of the game - when you can smash something over the net - and when your opponent gets to serve, get the ball thwacked straight back in your face?More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"saturday morning uk news briefing todays top headlines telegraph","story":"Medical advisers will next month insist that Boris Johnson makes a political decision on whether to vaccinate children and will not offer a firm recommendation, The  understands. In a break from previous practice, the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation (JCVI) is expected to set out options and consequences rather than taking a stance on the controversial issue.

Wrexham-based Topwood Ltd was given a place on the Shared Business Services framework as a potential supplier for local NHS trusts in February , seven months after Mr Hancock became Health Secretary. Mr Hancock then faced questions last month when it emerged he had a % stake in the shredding firm - which owned and run by his sister and brother-in-law. Lord Geidt, the independent adviser on the ministersapos interests, today ruled Mr Hancock acted properly and honestly in promptly declaring his % stake, which was a new financial interest. But the watchdog also said Mr Hancock should have declared his link to the firm when it won the NHS framework contract in  - which he did not do, because he wasnapost aware it had happened. Lord Geidt today noted that Mr Hancockaposs sister and brother-in-law would have been well aware that he was the UK Health Secretary.  Either the Secretary of State’s sister and or brother-in-law failed to raise this award with Mr Hancock, or nothing had otherwise been brought to Mr Hancock’s attention such that he would have had reason to enquire, the watchdog wrote. He added: I believe there to be a danger that a reasonable person might perceive this link to represent a conflict of interest, and that it should have been declared at the time. In reaching this determination, I accept that the scale of NHS operations in Englandare broad and that the activity of NHS SBS may have been very far from the Secretary of State’s main focus. I assess this earlier failure to declare the interest was as a result of his lack of knowledge and in no way deliberate, and therefore, in technical terms, a minor breach of the Ministerial Code. The report added: I recognise that Mr Hancock has acted with integrity throughout and that this event should in no way impugn his good character or ministerial record."},{"url":null,"title":"amazing treasure island style home","story":"NewsAmazing Treasure Island style home owned by former Lads Mag owner on sale for £mFelix Dennis, who died in , built the , square foot home from the fortune he made from publishing magazines like MaximmirrorShareCommentsByLorraine KingAdam BarnettAlison Jones:,  MAY NewsFelix Dennis drew inspiration from the novel Treasure Island for his £ million home Highfield\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.SubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Your information will be used in accordance with ourPrivacy Notice.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeA bar has been accused of aposhomophobiaapos for banning public displays of affection aposthat disrupt straight clienteleapos.A Facebook post by Guys and Dolls on the Isle of Man says PDA is banned for straight and gay people alike, as it aposundermines our community-based apos.The original post, announcing the venue is taking bookings post-lockdown, appeared to imply that gay people were deliberately flouting the PDA rule to disrupt straight drinkers. But the bar owner has rejected the criticism, claiming the policy applies to everyone regardless of sexuality, and called the bar all-inclusive. The post said: All staff are now aware of our PDApolicy and why we apply it. Also the manner itaposs being used to undermine our community-based . Any further attempts to deliberately provoke it will be regarded as anti-social behaviour aimed directly to disrupt our straight clientele, many of whom have family members who are from LGBT+ groups.  The post was met with a wave of criticism with  replies. Caitlin Aimee Dunn commented: Iaposm literally in disbelief that this post is even real. I always thought that GDaposs was a safe space for the LGBTQ community to go out and let their hair down, without fear of judgement. After the complaints, Guys and Dolls shared another message saying the PDA policy is for regulating behaviour that would be considered by other guests as socially unacceptable. It added: In a mixed environment this sometimes gets confused as being unfair when it isnapost. Our rules apply to all regardless of sexuality etc. The post continued: A simple kiss between two people wouldnapost cause any issue, it happens frequently. However when things get a little more heated itaposs a dferent story and as in any public venue a request to cool it down will be made.  Kara Varetto, , fell foul of the policy in , when they were told by bar staff to stop kissing their girlfriend Gina Kinrade, , on a Pride night. Kara said: I was just about to go to the bar and I kissed my partner briefly. One of the staff members very snappily said aposstop that.apos We were both taken aback and we giggled, but then we realised she was being serious. We went up to her to get an explanation, and she told us that we werenapost allowed to kiss on the premises, as it was their PDA rule. When she said that, I remember looking around and seeing lots of couples kissing. I have a lot of friends who are straight and as far as Iaposm aware, theyaposve never been chucked out of there for kissing. Kara, a support worker and Pride Youth representative, added: I think the recent Facebook posts were very badly worded, and the way theyaposve gone about enforcing this rule comes across as very homophobic.”  Richard Wernham, owner of Guys and Dolls, defended the policy, saying it applied to everyone, and condemned what he called  claims, denying he was homophobic. Weaposre an all-inclusive venue, he said. Iaposve been running it for ten years. Iaposve been accused of being homophobic, which is absolutely ridiculous. Thereaposs not a homophobic bone in my body. We do cater for the islandaposs LGBT, but we also cater to an older audience, some of them straight, some of them gay. We have a policy which dates before I was involved, initially called a aposno-kissingapos rule. I changed its name to make it more understandable. It applies to gay people, straight people, lesbians. It doesnapost matter. Itaposs about keeping standards of behaviour high and not about spoiling peopleaposs fun.  He called the criticism on Facebook a malicious attack that seems highly orchestrated. The row comes in the same year that the Isle of Man will be hosting its first Pride event. Kara said: Thereaposs a lot of good thataposs going on here, and itaposs a shame that this has cast a really bad light on the Isle of Man. Though they added: You can see some people from the older generation who are falling behind a little bit. A spokesperson for Isle of Pride, an LGBT charity, said: Recent Facebook comments from a local bar have demonstrated that while we may have come a long way on the journey to equality, there is still more work to do.The ability to hold hands and kiss your partner in public is not restricted in law nor to being a specic gender or sexual orientation.

Mark Oxtoby suffered second degree burns on a school skiing trip when he was . Now , Mark wants to share his horric ordeal as a warning to others. The actor from Hayes, Kent, has had nasal tissue replaced with skin from his forehead. The procedure was delicate, and Markaposs recovery has been slow and painful. He recalls leaning over to switch on the shower at one point and feeling an excruciating pain. Half of my face just ripped off, he said.  Mark now has collapsed nostrils and can no longer smell properly. He first noticed a freckle on his nose had started to grow in , but didnapost get it checked by a doctor until three years later. He was diagnosed with melanoma, a form of skin cancer that can spread to other organs in the body. Mark, who lives with we Dawn, , and daughter, Lily, , said he should have been more vigilant.  He described how he got sunburnt on the trip to Switzerland all those years ago – and the signs he should have noticed sooner. I used the sun cream that was given to us, but it was the eighties so it probably wasnapost as effective, he said. I woke up one day covered in blisters. I was stuck to the pillow. Iaposve always been freckly and in , I was on stage performing in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. At the end, one of the actors said I had make up on my nose but it was the freckle.  I didnapost get it checked just because le gets in the way. I ran the London marathon and someone took a photo of me and I could really see how much the freckle had grown. Then in , someone  pointed out that I had muck on my nose. Thataposs when I went to get it checked. I insisted that they did a biopsy – and thank God I did, or who knows what  I would have lost.  They removed what they thought was cancerous and a safe zone around it so itaposs double the size. I lost so much skin on my nose... a skin graft wouldnapost cut it because it would look like patchwork. I was spun into a world of not knowing what was going to happen or what I was going to look like. Mark underwent four operations to remove the cancerous tissue, and three more procedures to replace it with skin from his forehead.Mark worried that his scars would ruin his career as an actor,and thought he would have to give up his job. He said: I woke up with  staples in my head. It was heartbreaking for my we and daughter to see, but they dealt with it brilliantly. The doctors said that after the surgery, I should be able to walk down the road without anyone noticing – which is fineyouaposre an office worker but Iaposm an actor and have to do close up camera shots. I didnapost knowtheyaposd removed it all or how I was going to look – orI would be able to carry on acting. I couldnapost leave the house for three months becausethe skin gets cold it can die. If the skin died, there wasnapost anything  I could do. Mark wants to warn others of the importance of wearing sun protection and the need for regular skin checks. He said: Iaposm living the best le I can now. Iaposm just really grateful that it was caught when it was. Iaposd rather have my scars than be dead. Itaposs an amazing lesson to just use sun cream – and donapost think it wonapost happen to you.Mark praised the NHS for their amazing efforts.

Liam feels that the lockdown impact constitutes “exceptional circumstances”. He said: We were really sure of the term dates because of the pandemic and we had managed to get one of the first holidays to Haven booked in over a weekend.

We were so angry with the attitude from the school and the threat of a fine after they have been kept out of school for so long.

Merlin Hayward moved into a new property in Newport, Wales, with partner Laura as they were expecting a child and needed a bigger place. But after moving on March , Mr Hayward said faults with the flat kept emerging, claiming it was cold and dirty.Poor sound insulation and insecure windows were among the issues reported to letting agency RedKey Property Services, WalesOnline reports. But earlier this month they were given notice to leave the property. The letting agency says that they tried to address the familyaposs concerns and they have six months until they need to move out.Have you experienced anything of the sort  Let us know at webnews@mirror “When I walked in I knew it wasn’t in a good condition at all,” Mr Hayward claimed. “But we were extremely restricted with our budget and we had a child on the way, so I agreed to take it on.” “I found myself waking up in the middle of the night with adrenaline because the noise was that loud from the flat above,” he explained. “It’s not the tenant’s fault - the walls and ceiling should be insulated to protect against this issue. “I offered the letting agency £, of my own money to help insulate the property, but it became very clear there was no room for negotiation.  “We then found a mouse hole in the bathroom which was blocked up with some loose wood, and I have a very small child who can’t go on the floor because it is in such a bad condition. “Rather than fixing the problem with the sound insulation, the letting agency offered we move flats again,” he said. “But that isn’t the correct solution. The reasonable thing is surely to make sure the sound insulation is right for every tenant. “It beggars belief that they weren’t willing to make any investment beyond what they absolutely had to. “Our oven didn’t work and so they had to replace it, and did so with an oven that was that big it protruded from the rest of the kitchen units.”  But RedKey insists it did all they could to help the couple before serving notice on them. A spokeswoman for RedKey said: “Mr Hayward and his partner have a tenancy at the property they rent via RedKey Property Services until September , . They have not been evicted. “We have worked hard to accommodate the demands made by Mr Hayward since he moved into his existing premises on March . This included offering him alternative accommodation that would have alleviated the noise issues he was concerned about. This offer was declined. “After failing to reach an agreement with Mr Hayward we issued the Section  notice on Friday, May . This is a notice to bring a tenancy to an end and signy that there is no extension or renewal of the tenancy. Mr Hayward has until November  to find alternative accommodation.”  According to the Government website, a Section  notice is used to evict tenants with shorthold tenancies. Previously the minimum notice period was two months but that was extended to six as a result of the pandemic. Mr Hayward said he has been told he could end up in emergency accommodation, where drug users and people suffering with substance misuse may be temporarily rehomed alongside his family. “I am scared for my son,” he added. “It’s really tough. It’s been a hugely demanding period for us emotionally. Instead of concentrating on supporting my family I’m worrying about getting us a council house. “More protection is needed for renters against eviction when renters are only asking for a basic standard of living. “Everyone should be entitled to a decent living space that is clean and that works - especially when I’m paying what the government considers a reasonable rate.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnLiving standardsRenting"},{"url":null,"title":"dad who spent 3 months","story":"NewsDad who spent  months building epic treehouse for kids ordered to remove it by councilKai Grunwald, , built a huge treehouse ft high for his daughters to play in but Dacorum Borough Council said he should have sought planning permission, giving him  days to remove itmirrorShareCommentsByRyan MerrieldReporter:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsKai Grunwalk has slammed Dacorum Borough Council after he was ordered to remove the treehouse \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Kai Grunwald forked out £, to build the wooden structure - which includes a slide and climbing wall - for daughters Kara, six, and Kayleigh, four. But the -year-old, from Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, said itaposs a case of red tape gone mad after Dacorum Borough Council told him to demolish it within  days. The authority sent Kai, a strategy director, a letter stating the treehouse is a breach of planning regulations because it is over .m in height. The dad admits he should have sought planning permission in hindsight but struggles to understand the councilaposs attitude.Have you had similar issues with a local council  Let us know at webnews@mirror It’s not like I’ve built a block of flats or something like that without permission, I just wanted to do something nice for the girls, Kai told The Sun. One of the great joys for me, apart from their excitement, was the encouragement, smiles and comments I received whilst making it. It was a lovely way to engage with the community. Working on the treehouse on evenings and weekends, Kai said it also helped to distract him from his day job which sees him staring at a computer screen most of the day.  Along with we Kerryn, , he wants to be able to submit a planning application retrospectively and work with the council to ensure everything fits the regulations. However, Kai said DBC has shut that option down and wants the treehouse gone, which he said seems totally unfair. The council raised concerns about the safety of the structure, as it encroaches on a footpath, as well as the visual impact on the street in its letter. However, Kai disputes this, having made it all from high quality material and is adamant it is very safe, while it only marginally overhangs the street path below. A council spokesperson told the Mirror: Dacorum Borough Council was informed of the structure within the Berkhamsted area of Dacorum.Following an investigation and considering planning policies, the Council has explained the reasons why the structure should be removed.The homeowner can apply for retrospective planning permission and we are happy to discuss modications or alternatives.This would enable the Council to assess the impact fully including taking into account any comments which may be received from local residents.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnDiyers"},{"url":null,"title":"dying bride marries partner 22","story":"NewsDying bride marries partner of  years in touching hospital wedding ceremonyCarole Graham and Jean Davies, both , from Heswall, got married in Arrowe Park Hospital in Wirral, where Carole has been a patient since she was diagnosed with terminal cancermirrorShareCommentsByCharlotte HadfieldLorraine King:,  MAY NewsCarole Graham and Jean Davies have been partners for  years \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

This is because it can take several weeks for the body to develop protection against the illness and the current vaccines need two doses to be fully effective. Scientists at Kingaposs College in London have been researching cases of infection after vaccine, by examining data from around . million people who had been vaccinated between last December and mid May.  They found that , adults tested positive after vaccination, or just . per cent. That figure drops even further for those who had two doses, with just , or . per cent catching Covid. Researchers identied a number of symptoms to keep an eye out for after youaposve had your vaccine, and weaposve listed them below.. Sneezing Although not included as one of the key symptoms of the disease, scientists say sneezing may need to be monitored. It was  per cent more common in people under  with Covid- after getting their jab. Sneezing was the only symptom which was more commonly reported in vaccinated people with Covid.The Kingaposs College London researchers looked at hundreds of thousands of people in the UK using the ZOE Covid Symptom Study app.But the study found those who had been vaccinated against the virus were less likely to report any of the original symptoms of coronavirus.. Shortness of breath Although a iety of health conditions can trigger shortness of breath, Covid can be one of them. If you are feeling out of breath, or winded after a jab it could be worth getting a test. Vaccinated people with Covid- reported similar levels of shortness of breath, the study says. But itaposs important to note that vaccinated adults who contract Covidv experience a less severe illness than those who havenapost had the jab, researchers added.  Earache is another potential symptom people who have had the Coronavirus vaccine should be aware of.Covid patients who havenapost had the jab have complained of tinnitus, a condition that causes a persistent ringing sound in the ears, and muffled hearing.If you suffer from ear pain in the days after taking the vaccine, it could be a sign youaposve caught the disease.. Swollen glands A less common side effect after the vaccine is swollen glands in the armpit or neck. While they usually go away within a few days, they could also be a sign of infection. However, anyone who has taken the vaccine should be aware that one in four people experience side effects, including sweating, chills, fatigue and aches.

How someone is told of the passing of a loved one is not really a suitable matter for conjecture or speculation. It is private.”Harry, , flew back to the UK to attend Philipaposs funeral in Windsor, but his heavily pregnant we Meghan Markle, , did not travel on the advice of her doctors and stayed home with their son Archie.It was the first time Harry had been reunited with his family since he and Meghan gave an explosive interview to talk show queen Oprah Winfrey in March.Meghan claimed the family had several conversations about how dark he unborn childaposs skin would be and she was refused help when she was struggling with mental health issues.Earlier this week, Harry and Oprah revealed they have been working on their new docuseries aposThe Me You Canapost Seeapos for two years.The show explores mental health and emotional well-being and includes featured interviews from Lady Gaga, Glenn Close, NBA star DeMar DeRozan and others about their experiences.

The photos seem to show Britain’s biggest prison looking more like a cheap hotel than a place of punishment. One shows a light and airy double room and single room at Her Majesty’s Prison Five Wells, with brightly coloured walls and unobstructed views over the beautul River Nene and a fishing lake. The UK’s first privately run mega prison in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, which has buildings in the shape of crosses, has just been structurally finished and is set to be completed by October. What is your view  Have your say in the comment section  The new-style £ million super prison will hold , inmates, making it England’s biggest prison, with the first prisoner due on January , next year. HMP Five Wells tweeted: “Been a busy day on site today but took the opportunity to grab a couple of pics for you. One of a double room, there are  in total, and one of the single rooms with the FANTASTIC barless window …albeit not the best view at present #bestprisonever.”Like news to one of the Mirroraposs newsletters The category C jail is seen as a flagship example of the Government’s aim to create a “modern, efficient prison estate that is fit for the future” and will have a clear focus on rehabilitating offenders. It will not hold the most dangerous prisoners. It has been built on the site of the former HMP Wellingborough site, which closed in , and held a maximum of  adult male inmates. The jail designers have ditched the usual K-shaped formation of prison housing blocks and instead used seven staggered cross-shaped buildings.  The K-block style has been favoured since Victorian times, with the idea that a single prison officer could be placed in the centre of the radial arms of corridors and survey all the cells quickly. Older jails have come under criticism for overcrowding and filthy conditions in recent years. The new cross-shaped buildings mean the corridors are broken up into smaller zones, rather than miles of long corridors, which will enable prison staff to have more direct contact with prisoners.  The buildings have been arranged around landscaped courtyards, with the cross-shaped design offering a better use of outside space for sports and gardening facilities. The prison’s landscaped grounds will also include four football pitches. There will be one central hub for education, vocational training and social facilities. In  it emerged that the prison will provide more than  jobs for local residents.Speaking when the prison construction was announced, then-Prisons Minister Rory Stewart said: “Providing offenders with decent conditions and regimes is absolutely key to turning their lives around and ultimately keeping the public safe.” FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnPrisonsCrime"},{"url":null,"title":"kim jong un orders officials","story":"NewsKim Jong-un orders officials to eliminate cats and pigeons in bid to stop Covid spreadKim Jong-un declared war on the animals, because he fears they are bringing the deadly virus across the border from China into North KoreamirrorShareCommentsByNathan Hyde:,  MAY News on May ,  shows North Korean leader Kim Jong Un attending the Central Military Commission of the Workers Party of Korea\" content\"https:i-prod.mirror incoming article.ece ALTERNATES s _NKOREA-MILITARY-DEFENCE.jpg\"Kim Jong-un has reportedly declared a war on cats and pigeons, because he fears they are spreading Covid- \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

I remember accompanying my mum on our frequent visits to ious friends’ houses for a cup of tea and a sandwich. On those many occasions I was told to sit in a corner, to “be quiet” and “here’s a magazine for you to keep yourself occupied”. Woman’s Own was plonked on to my lap, andI was really lucky, I got to see Woman’s Weekly too, depending on how long my mum and her friends chattered on. With my nose in a magazine, I could disguise the fact that I was listening in to their fascinating adult conversations, which often featured grown-up titbits that I didn’t quite understand. If I even dared to open my mouth out of turn, my mum would again say “be quiet and don’t show off”. Showing off was definitely NOT appreciated and children who did it were thought of as vain and brash. These days, though, showing off is a part of daily le, with most people doing so each and every day, thanks to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.All of them hoping their posts will draw appreciation and virtual “likes” rather than the scolding I usedto attractI dared to voice my opinion during an adult gathering.“Only speak when you are spoken to” used to be the standard warning for most children. What, then, would parents operating in those relatively innocent times think of the daily outpouring of opinions, “likes”, hatred, bullying and threats that our children, whether they be eight or , are subjected to via social media  When a dark, scary, threatening message of hatred follows them into school and back home again, there’s no hiding. No escape. Unless they turn their phones off, which can make parents even more worried as to where their child has got to on their way home from school. So, hurrah, then, for Instagram, which has announced it’s giving users the option to hide how many people have “liked” their posts following concerns it was affecting mental health. I have to say, I’ve deliberately steered clear of most social media apart from Twitter, after being blitzed by vile hatred during some of my time on breakfast TV. There were always plenty of lovely comments too, but it’s the voices of hate that stick in your mind and permeate your self-worth, causing sleepless nights and fear of what the next day may bring. The Instagram move is a start, especially as the social media giant’s boss Adam Mosseri wants users to focus more on “connecting with friends or being inspired”, rather than counting “likes”.

The researchers define a aposhotspotapos as a local authority where there are - or are predicted to be - more than  new cases of Covid- per , of the population per week. Public Health Englandhas identied the North West city as an area to watch based on its own data which shows a growing cluster of confirmed cases of Covid-.Have you been affected by the Indian coronavirus iant  Email webnews@mirror. Blackburn with Darwen, Bedford, Rossendale and Bolton are expected to remain top Covid hotspots for weeks, the Imperial College London map shows. Manchesteraposs probability of becoming a new hotspot by Sunday is  per cent, but it rises to  per cent by June , the researchers said. Separate data from PA shows rates continue to rise across the North West, including Greater Manchester, as the Health Secretary said Covid vaccines are severing the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths. Burnleyaposs seven-day rate has climbed to  new cases per , people, with a total of  confirmed cases, in the week to May .  It is the seventh highest rate in England, up from . the previous week. Manchesteraposs rate is the eighth highest, going from from . to ,, with  new cases. Bury is ninth with a rate of  , up from . the previous week. Bolton has highest Covid rate Englandaposs highest rates are found in the Indian iant hotspots of Bolton , Blackburn with Darwen , Bedfordand Rossendale , though it appears the Bolton outbreak could be nearing its peak. The latest data from PHE show the Manchester cluster continuing to grow in size.  PHE epidemiologist Meaghan Kall tweeted: By local authority we see Bolton cluster and Bedford continue to increase in size. Other clusters also growing but nothing of note apart from Manchester joining the mix as one to watch. Councillor Joanna Midgley, executive member for health and care for Manchester City Council, said officials are taking robust action to prevent the spread of the iant.She said: “From the week beginning March , vaccinations started to be offered to residents aged  and above in eight city wards.Residents in these wards are at a greater risk of contracting the virusit spreads which is why action was taken sooner rather than later.  “It has been known for a long time that Covid was something we will have to adapt with as the vaccination programme continues.It’s vital that people continue to wear their masks, maintain social distancing and wash their hands to ensure their own safety, and that of their community.” Manchesterapos Director of Public Health David Regan added: “We are closely monitoring confirmed cases of the iant that originated in India, and I want to reassure residents that steps are being taken to prevent its spread. “While viruses mutate and change, it’s important to stress that this is normal and from time to time we will see iants pop up. “There is no evidence to indicate this iant is more dangerous, and preliminary studies have shown that our vaccines are effective against it and prevent people from getting seriously ill. “As always residents should keep wearing their masks, socially distancing and handwashing, and adhering to the most up to date public health guidance.” UK-wide cases of the Indian iant have doubled in a week - from , to , - leading to fresh doubts over the ending of Covid restrictions in England next month. Boris Johnson warned that freedom from restrictions on June  may have to wait. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said up to three quarters of new UK Covid cases could be of the Indian iant, and there are “early signs” that rates in Bolton are starting to “cap out. The Government is waiting for fresh data to find out how the continuing surge has affected hospital admissions, which have increased slightly but remain low across England.  PHE said the hospital admission rate for Covid- was . per , people in the week to May , compared with . per , in the previous week. The daily number of Covid caseshas been increasing, with , announced on Thursday, a week-on-week rise of  per cent. The daily number of deaths has remained level. Promising data from PHE show just three per cent of Britons infected with the Indian iant were fully vaccinated. Almost  per cent had not received a single dose. Other figures show the average age of people testing positive has fallen to , the youngest ever recorded during the pandemic and down from  at the start of the year.  A majority of older Britons have received at least one dose of a vaccine. Meanwhile, a total of , cases of the Indian iant had been detected in England as of Tuesday, a new PHE report found. Of those, involved international travel. By region, the North West had the highest total, with , as of Tuesday, amid surge testing in a number of areas. This accounts for  per cent of Englandaposs confirmed cases of the B... iant. The North West was followed by London, which had  cases, and the East of England, which had . There were  in the East Midlands,  in the South East and  in the West Midlands. The North East had the fewest number of cases , followed by the South Westand Yorkshire  Humber . Mr Hancock said on Thursday that the increase in cases of the Indian iant remained focused in “hotspots” where surge testing and vaccinations were taking place.He said of  people in hospital with coronavirus in Bolton, only five have had both doses of vaccine.Mr Hancock added: “So when you get the call, get the jab, and make sure you come forward for your second doses so you can get the maximum possible protection. “The vaccine is severing the link between cases and hospitalisations and deaths from coronavirus.”FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnCoronavirusMutant Coronavirus"},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownmirrorShareByDave MastersDigital Commercial Editor:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Laura Roberts was determined to give her children amazing experiences after she was given the devastating news that her pancreatic cancer was terminal. From a helicopter ride to a night in the Savoy Hotel the brave -year-old made sure her final year was as memorable as possible for her girls instead of focussing on her illness. Laura from Shrewsbury, Shropshire, was given her diagnosis on May  last year after going to AE with pains in her chest. The devoted parent made the decision not to be told how long she could expect to live, and instead chose to focus on her daughters, Jade, , Ellie, , and Lily, aged . Her sisters Cha and Leann began raising money to fund new experiences for Laura and her children Cha said: We are so grateful for the kind and generous people of Shrewsbury for donating. This allowed my sister to do everything she wanted over the last year. Laura and her girls were able to do a helicopter ride together over Wolverhampton and travel to London, to stay in the Savoy Hotel and sightsee. Also the whole family stayed in the Boars Head pub, which was hired out just for us. Laura was also able to celebrate all three girlsapos birthdays, as well as her own and we managed to spend a final magical Christmas all together, staying in log cabins. But On May , we lost our beautul Laura. Her health had been deteriorating since her chemo finished in December. She had been in and out of the hospital and the hospice since March. It started out as ascites, which was a build-up of fluid in the stomach. This caused so much pain for her and meant she could hardly eat anything. Then the doctors said the cancer had taken over.  On May  they had told my parents she only had days left. Then on the evening of May , she passed with my sister Leann and my mum Nicky beside her. Throughout all of this, she still kept her witty and sometimes quite dark sense of humour. And of course her biggest smile right until the end. The Severn Hospice and the Severn Hospice cafe were absolutely incredible. The cafe allowed us to have a table all day so we had somewhere to sit, when other family members were visiting my sister – we have a very big close family. They also allowed us to have a family room, so we could all be together and stay with Laura. A lovely group of girls created a page to help us with our fundraising, a couple of months ago. Lily, Laura’s youngest daughter came up with the idea that we would have a memorial bench with the money raised from that page. The bench will be in Tywyn, where my parents have a caravan and where we have all spent many summers all together. We are currently in the process of planning to do something to raise money for Severn Hospice, as they were so brilliant with me and my family as well as taking special care of my sister. We are so grateful we were all able to see her and spend some time with her in her last days. And without the hospice being in Shrewsbury, we would not have been able to do this so we would really like to give something back to them. Laura’s funeral will be on Friday at the Abbey Church. We chose that church as it’s beautul just like our Laura.To donate to the appeal visit here and to learn more visit facebook fundraisingforlauraandhergirls.

In her mid-twenties, Kystalrose found herself living in a homeless hostel and expecting a child. Unable to rely on friends or family for a place to stay, the north London woman moved into a small one bed flat on the private market with the help of housing benefits and gave birth to her daughter. Krystalrose quickly discovered that the walls had been slapped with fresh white paint for a reason. Soon mould began to grow in the property, eating through the mum and daughteraposs clothes and bedding. Do you have a housing story to share  Email webnews@mirror  While the -year-old struggled to cope with an eviction notice served during the pandemic which will see the pair out this autumn, her baby daughter was mourning the loss of her favourite toys. All her teddies were affected and her first ever baby grow, Krystalrose told The Mirror. Even down to her first shoes, her bedding. One of her toys I couldnapost wash it and save it for her. She was crying because she didnapost understand why I had to throw it away. The mouldy home has also impacted the mum and daughteraposs health. She said: I have been getting chest pains, my breathing gets worse, I have shortness of breath and panic attacks as well. My daughter doesnapost have breathing problems, but keeps getting colds and eye infections. It has been a nightmare to watch my daughter grow up in it. Krystalrose is one of the . million people new research from Shelter found are living in homes with signicant damp, mould and condensation in the UK. She is also part of the four million people who are forced to regularly cut back on essential items, like food and heating, to pay their housing costs.  “I pay good money for this place - I can’t afford a big food shop anymore I really have to watch how much I eat, she continued. I thought for the amount of money it was going to be a proper home. Iaposve tried to make it feel like one, but itaposs not. The mould has ruined my daughteraposs cot and all our clothes. We’re living out of bags. Iaposm asthmatic and we have both become ill because of it. Itaposs just been about coping. Iaposm on antidepressants now because of the stress. All I want is a home where we can feel safe and comfortable. The simple things like a wardrobe to pack your clothes away a living room with a sofa to sit on not having to share a bedroom. My daughter doesn’t know what that feels like. It’s like our lives can’t move forward.”  Although Krystalrose struggles with her mental health, she is determined to hold things together for her daughter. Her resolve is strengthened by her singing, which she loves to do and helps her through the tough times.The single mum is determined to get back to work when she can and even pursue a singing career one day.There are days when I am falling apart, but Iaposm trying to stay strong for my daughter, Krystalrose said.

It comes after Public Health Englandresearch, published last week, found both Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are much less effective against B. after one dose. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agencyrecommends the interval between doses for the AstraZenec vaccine should be between four and  weeks, while the second dose of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine should be administered after at least three weeks. PHE states the number of cases of B. rose by , over the last week to , and hospitalisations are rising in some of the affected areas. Bolton, Bedford and Blackburn with Darwen are the worst hit. PHE said in a statement: Hospital attendances and admissions are predominantly in unvaccinated iniduals, highlighting how crucial it is that people in these areas come forward to receive vaccination. The latest analysis suggests the iant could be as much as  per cent more transmissible than the already infectious Kent iant , which drove the surge in cases last winter that led to the third national lockdown.

Ministers are said to be pushing for an end to the one metre rule over the ditching of the mask mandate, it has been reported. Today some experts argued that restrictions should remain in place until more of the population have received both vaccine doses, with Professor Christina Pagel, from University College London and a member of Independent Sage, saying reopening should be delayed for a few more months. But the chief executive of industry body UK Hospitality, Kate Nicholls, said it was absolutely critical that the remainder of the hospitality sector is allowed to unlock on June .  From June  the table service only rules that have been shaping the way pubs and bars operate may be dropped.As well as bringing a bit of energy back into boozers, the change would allow drinking holes to welcome more customers - giving them a much needed boost, the Sun reports.Doing away with the one metre rule could allow Brits to feel a little more normal and not fixate on the pandemic so much, evenmasks rules remain in force.However, whether or not any more restrictions are eased come the middle of next month depends on how the coronavirus case situation looks. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told reporters on Thursday he didnapost see anything currently in the data to ert from the June reopening target, adding: But we may need to wait.  Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said on Friday thereaposs nothing in the data that suggests to me that we should move the day of June , when all legal limits on social contact are due to be lted in England. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: The caveat obviously is the data can change. Soscientic evidence data points to an increased hospitalisation rate, increased degree of risk, then we have flexibility to move that date.  But he added: As of today, as of the data Iaposve seen, I didnapost think we will move the date. But I canapost guarantee that on May , you will appreciate I cannot guarantee that in three-and-a-half weeksapos time. Data for England published on Friday by the Office for National Statisticsshows an estimated one in , people in private households had Covid- in the week to May  - broadly unchanged from one in , in the previous week. The estimate for Scotland is around one in , up from one in ,, putting Scotland back to where it was around a month ago. Meanwhile, the reproduction number - the R value - for England is  to ., up from . and . the previous week, suggesting the epidemic is growing. The growth rate, which estimates how quickly the number of infections is changing day by day, is between % and %, meaning the number of new infections could be broadly flat or growing by up to % every day. Scientists have warned against reading too much into the numbers when the numbers of cases, hospital admissions or deaths are at low levels or there is a high degree of iability in transmission in a region.  The latest seven-day average for daily hospital admissions in England is  , which is an increase of % on seven days earlier. The figure means hospital admissions are back to where they were at the start of May and remain % below the second-wave peak in January. Public Health Englanddata shows that the majority of people with the Indian iant have not been vaccinated, with just % of casesfrom February  to May  having received both doses. Of  people who ended up in AE, just five people had had both vaccine doses, while  were unvaccinated and  had had their first dose more than three weeks previously. Of  patients who needed to be admitted to hospital overnight, only one person had had both vaccines, the PHE data showed. Over the period there were  deaths linked to the iant, of which eight were among the unvaccinated. Dr Helen Wall, senior responsible officer for the Covid vaccine programme in Bolton, which is one of the hotspots for the iant, said there are signicant numbers of - and -year-olds going into hospital there, and tens of thousands of people in the area who have only just become eligible for the vaccine. But she told BBC Radio aposs Today programme that hospitals were seeing patients who were far less sick than previous Covid patients. In terms of how ill theyaposre getting, I think the vaccine definitely seems to be working, she said. We are not seeing, certainly not many people as sick as we would have done pre-vaccine, certainly the picture in hospital is much better to previous times when weaposve been at this position."},{"url":null,"title":"teenage nursery worker caught cctv","story":"NewsTeenage nursery worker caught on CCTV who sexually abused nine children found guiltyDuring a trial at Exeter Crown Court a jury heard how Jayden McCarthy, , spent too much time playing with children, allowing them to crawl on him at a playgroup in TorquaymirrorShareByPaul GreavesAnita Merritt:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsJayden McCarthys offences came to light when a girl told her parents what had happened\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Jayden McCarthy abused his position to carry out a series of serious offences against young children at the age of . Staff noticed that the teenager, who raped one child and molested eight others, spent too much time playing with children, allowing them to crawl on him, Devon Live reported. They put his behaviour at the Torquay playgroup down to inexperience. During a trial at Exeter Crown Court it was heard that the offences came to light when a girl came home from nursery and told her parents that an adult called Jayden had sexually abused her. One parent told the court: It was a big shock and we didnapost really know what to do. The parents immediately called the nursery to ask who Jayden was and report what had happened.  I askedthey had someone called Jayden working there as I hadnapost heard of him before then and I askedJayden had got my daughter changed because she had said he had changed her in the toilets. The parents visited the nursery that evening looking for answers and were told McCarthy had been suspended while the claims were investigated. Police launched a major investigation. McCarthy admitted changing the girl out of wet clothes in the toilet but denied any sexual offence. The incident was not captured on CCTV. A member of staff said she noticed he had taken longer than usual to change the child.She went to see what was happening and McCarthy said he was having trouble getting her dressed. McCarthy, from Brixham, was charged with  offences, which he denied.The jury retired yesterday to make their deliberations and ed guilty verdicts to all charges this afternoon. Police searched through more than  hours of other footage from the weeks leading up to the offence to seethere were any other incidents of sexual behaviour. They found  incidents which caused concern.The jury was played clips of CCTV which showed McCarthy sexually assaulting children.He would often sexually assault children while playing with them on the ground or while applying sun cream to their bodies, the prosecution said. Prosecutor Jason Beal said: Over the course of several weeks in  Jayden McCarthy sexually assaulted nine children. These assaults were of ying degrees of seriousness, ranging from touching children over and under clothing in their private areas to an incident of rape. Judge David Evans adjourned the case for a psychiatric and pre-sentence reports to be completed. McCarthy was released on bail and willto the court on Friday, July , for sentencing. Judge Evans said: You have been found guilty on the clearest possible evidence of grave sexual offences against young and very young children, at a time when you yourself were a youth.

Temperatures are expected to reach C in London on Saturday and C in Manchester and Liverpool on Sunday. While on Monday, the mercury is set to reach C, meaning it would surpass the current high for , which was .Crecorded in Kew Gardens on March . Met Office forecaster Alex Deakin said: Sunglasses, sunhat and sun screen definitely required this weekend. Finally, some warm sunshine on offer this May after what has been a very, very chilly month. He added: We will start the weekend with a lot of cloud and for some it will be a bit damp and dreary, initially, certainly over the Midlands, parts of Wales and the west coast of Scotland, but that rain should be fizzling out through the morning.  Most places will steadily brighten up but it could take a while. Some places will be cloudy into the afternoon, but generally it is turning sunnier as the day goes on. The Met Officeaposs provisional stats show the UK has already had its fourth wettest May on record with an average of mm falling. The wettest locations, receiving more than twice the average rainfall, were the south west and north east of England, as well as Wales and parts of eastern Scotland. Parts of Scotland and northern England even saw snow at the beginning of the month when temperatures of -.C were recorded.According to the Met Office, the often dull and wet conditions resulted in subdued temperatures across the board.Forecaster Matthew Box said: Given that we have had a reasonably cold and then a wet couple of months through spring, with April being cold and May being wet and cloudy and generally on the cool side too, weaposve got a sunny end to May.  It might catch a few people out given that we havenapost seen much sun and UV levels are going to be quite high over the weekend as well so thataposs something to be aware of. Five-day UK weather forecast Today: Many areas start rather cloudy, breaks should develop, allowing some warm sunshine into the afternoon. A few places in northern, central and western UK might catch a shower, while some northeastern and eastern coasts will be cooler and misty.  Tomorrow: Low cloud and mist dispersing, then most areas having seeing spells of warm sunshine. Perhaps a stray shower in the northwest, while a few eastern coasts remain chilly and misty. Monday to Wednesday: Initially fine and very warm by day, although cooler with patchy low cloud along some windward coastlines. A band of rain, potentially thundery, moves northeast across the country midweek.FOLLOW USDailyMirrorFollow @DailyMirrorCOMMENTSAdd CommentMore OnMet OfficeSnowWeather"},{"url":null,"title":"man returns weeks long holiday","story":"NewsMan s from weeks long holiday to discover dead womans body in his bedA man from Corpus Christi, Texas had been away from his home for several weeks, he told police, before ing to find a body lying in bed in his bedroommirrorShareCommentsByMilo BoydReporter:,  MAY NewsThe woman was found in bed in Corpus Christi \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.When you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The remains of some  victims have been found, many showing gunshot wounds and evidence of torture. Other inmates are believed to have died from malnutrition and disease. Some  state investigators and search volunteers are currently working at the macabre and long-suspected site, part of a sinister hell camp system called Dulag- in Voronezh region. Harrowing video footage shows diggers unearthing skulls and body parts in an area occupied by Hitler’s forces during the Second World War. “The estimated death toll is about  people,” said Mikhail Segodin, head of the Don search volunteer squad, referring to this specic mass burial.

The current search for human remains concentrates on  pits - mass graves each containing between  and  remains in the vicinity of Lushnikovo village, Ostrogozhsky district. Judging by the remains unearthed so far we see shot wounds, blunt traumas, in other words, broken bones,” said Mr Segodin. The site is complicated because it was a camp for women and children.” The human remains are in a poor state, he said.  Mr Segodin added: “Mostly tubular bones have survived, but often only teeth remain from the skulls. “The only thing that can be said for sure is that almost all of the people who died here were young. “We did not find any valuable things, except perhaps a cigarette case damaged by gun fire. A Soviet intelligence report dated  September  from the Office of the Peopleaposs Commissariat of Internal Affairs for Voronezh region stated that a concentration camp for women and children is located at a brick factory in the suburban village of Lushnikovka”. The camp was described as being “in the open air, fenced with four rows of barbed wire” and it was “guarded by Magyars” [Hungarians].  The report alleged: “Prisoners are not fed, but children are allowed to gather alms, parcels are also allowed. “There are many ill people there, medical aid is not provided. “There is a high mortality rate. Intelligence documents also suggested the murder of children and cruelty against prisoners of war. Local historian Viktor Strelkin talked to eyewitnesses and surviving prisoners. I was told that in these pits, right under the feet of people who were still alive, lay the dead.  “Sometimes they lay openly, or they were covered with  or  centimetres of soil, but it sagged and the corpses were visible again.” Segodin said: “Search and identication work will continue together with specialists from theInvestigative Committee.” The concentration camp system Dulag- was created in the Voronezh region in . Inmates from Dulag- were forced to construct a railway for the Nazis known as the Berlinka line, built to supply German forces seeking to take Stalingrad. The burial was found thanks to unclassied secret service documents, and aerial photographs made by a German pilot in .

allow the business to grow long-term.It posted revenues of more than £m in its last financial year.Mr Scott said: “Our mission is to provide all British dogs and cats with the best possible nutrition.#This funding round will enable us to continue growing.#Attracting this recent investment demonstrates the long-term potential for Bella and Duke and showcases the signicant opportunity

says he has no regrets over last summer’s controversial SPFL vote U-turn that sent Scottish football into a frenzy.After the coronavirus pandemic halted the game last March, clubs voted on the governing body’s resolution to bring an end to the season.Dundee originally cast a vote against, along with a number of other clubs, only for their emailed voting slip to end up in the SPFL’s spam folder.With rules giving a -day period for voting, Nelms had the opportunity to reconsider.Eventually Dundee cast the decisive vote that saw the SPFL resolution pass, changing their original position and angering many.Titles were subsequently awarded to Celtic, Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers, while Hearts, Partick Thistle and Stranraer were relegated.In delaying his decision, Nelms says he came to understand how close some clubs were to “going to the sword” under the financial pressures brought by the pandemic.And in changing his vote, he allowed money to be paid out from the governing body to all clubs.Askedhe had any regrets, Nelms replied: “No.“When I changed my vote I was absolutely, vehemently against it because the way it was presented to us.“We weren’t trying to help each other out, we didn’t know everything and it was very rushed.“I wanted to understand more. The fact it gave me the opportunity to pause helped me make my decision – I got more information, I got to talk to a lot people.“People were really struggling at that time. I came to understand it was the only option that would be accepted by the majority of the people.“At that time of year, you are living hand to mouth in terms of people coming in the gates.“It wasn’t scaremongering because when you get to that time in the season, the money is thin.“There were clubs really struggling who needed the money.“I took the decision to change my vote. The Premiership and board dealt with what would happen there.“Out of all the votes, around % of the teams voted that way. I had a better understanding of how people would handle it.“I still think we should have helped each other out a bit more – that’s what I was trying to accomplish.If we had clubs going to the sword, what would we have left at the end of the day  That’s what I couldn’t live with.“If I didn’t vote that way, would four or five clubs go out of business “We didn’t have any good choices. We have  clubs you have to try and get facing in the same direction.“When I changed my vote I thought that was the only opportunity to make that happen, get the vote in and get people paid.“There will still be some debate but there was never going to be a good answer.”Speaking last summer after the vote was cast, Nelms indicated his strong support for league reconstruction.His hope then was to find a way, through a total revamp of the game, that wouldn’t see any club relegated.FULL TRANSCRIPT: Dundee chief John Nelms breaks his silence on SPFL vote saga\" title\"#FULL TRANSCRIPT: Dundee chief John Nelms breaks his silence on SPFL vote saga# # The Courier\" src\"https:www.thecourier fp sport football dundee-fc  full-transcript-dundee-chief-john-nelms-breaks-his-silence-on-spfl-vote-saga embed # secretpmzNgVnG\" data-secret\"pmzNgVnG\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"However, he says any hope of that was quickly extinguished once it was clear an agreement between all clubs couldn#t be reached.“Back then we didn’t have enough information,” he added.“Hindsight is  .“We were trying to figure out things every day.“It went from a vote to potentially reconstruction then that wasn’t going to happen and we’re wondering what the league might look like, when would fans be back.“So you were trying to put structure to something where there are no parameters.“It was unbelievably dficult.“My regret is I wish there was a much better solution but I don’t think there was.”Earlier this week Dundee were promoted back to the top flight after beating Kilmarnock in the Premiership play-off final.They finished second to Championship winners Hearts in the regular league campaign and will face the Jambos again in the Premiership next season.Relations between the clubs soured last year after Dundee’s U-turn saw the Edinburgh side relegated.Nelms, though, says the decision for the Premiership to stop was up to top-flight clubs and not down to his change of heart.“I didn’t vote for the Premiership to stop, they did and it was unanimous. There was a vote and it stopped,” he said.“They tried to figure out how to get the games on but we didn’t know about testing and all we can do now back then.“There was nothing they could do and they voted to stop.“We’ve done what we can do to help other clubs.

 Fitbits, Apple watches, pedometers on phones, it’s allowed people to have some control and track it.#But in terms of weight loss it is a little bit of a mixed bag because often , steps are done at too low an intensity to actually bring about additional health benefits.#Often when people aim for the , steps they will do a lower intensity in order to meet the , steps.#Whereasthey set a lower threshold they#ll probably do it at a higher intensity.“Ideally what you are looking for is moderate to vigorous intensity in terms of improving health and reducing body fat and improving body composition.#Calculating your heart rate will help you work outyou#re walking at a high enough intensity to get into the fat burning zone.One of the simplest ways is to subtract your age from  to calculate your maximum heart rate.Or a heart rate monitor with an activity tracker can also be used.Laura, who works at Robert Gordon University, says you ideally need to be working out at -% of your maximum heart rate to lose weight.She added: “Roughlyyou’re doing moderate to vigorous intensity you could cover  steps a minute so in  minutes you do about , steps.#If people want to address their aerobic fitness through walking either by doing the , steps or less at a higher intensity, the next thing for them to think about is their strength and resistance training.#That doesn’t have to be in a gym, it doesn’t have to be lting weights. It can be using body weights, it can be done at home or in a class.“People tend to forget that resistance training is part of the weekly recommendations as well. Resistance training is key for health for both men and women.“For example, a combination of aerobic and resistance training in people with diabetes has shown to better stabilise blood glucose than just doing aerobic or resistance training alone.“You should be aiming to do resistance training twice a week # this includes older adults as well to help reduce the risk of falls.#Aberdeen resident, Pauline McBain, started walking in  after she retired from her role as a catering manager.The -year-old was given a Fitbit as a gt and has been keeping up with her daily , steps a day routine ever since.The pensioner now coordinates the Dyce Health Walk group which is run by Sport Aberdeen and enjoys going out walking to keep active.And she said it turned out to be even more beneficial when she was diagnosed with myxoma, a growth on the heart.She said: #I actually had to have emergency surgery in October  and every medic said the benefit of me walking for four years was helping me with my recovery.“The biggest thing for me is that it definitely helps me to sleep. Before I had my operation I would go out at pm in the dark in the rainI hadn’t finished my , steps.“I enjoy walking, even in the rain. I love the wind in my face. It gives you a good feeling of wellbeing, I have a spring in my step.”The member of Dyce Parish Church is currently walking , steps in a month to raise money for the Christian Aid charity.She added: #One of the church elders got in touch and askedI could do it because I walk , steps a day.“It hooks you, definitely.

To use a golfing term there were quite a lot of #shanks# about, with Scott #Lefty# Gargan and Fiona McLeod locked in battle with their mates John Kennedy and Dorothy Clark, who had a vice-like grip on the match, whipping ahead -.In the league cross-over game, dark horses Mark Harkness and Richard Dewar were put to the sword by the evergreen Sandy Crawford and young Murray MacDonald.Neither of the two to-guns were wearing a mask on the green, but they ought to have as they robbed the dark horses at the last post to ride into the sunset with victory by an - margin.The week#s star pair were undoubtedly Anne Moore and Libby McGuinness, who were in cruise control for most of their match against Roddy MacDonald and Jamie MacLean.The Penelope Pitstop and Dick Dastardly of this whacky race left only scorched tyre tracks as they sped to an impressive - victory, despite Libby#s concern that the Arkansas Chuggabugs had a secret weapon, to pull out six shots in the last end.As the next round approaches, Guy and Ward willto the gym the undertaker will need to resurrect his form, the postman will need to deliver and the tea table out at Lingerton will be ided, with some cups tasting just that bit sweeter.With the Portavadie Cup, for the seasons most consistent player, well underway, a few players have posted notable wins with Liz Long notching her first three pointer and Colin #Last Bowl# MacInnes remaining unbeaten."},{"url":null,"title":"cash jump for youth football","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

That data is supported by further research, carried out specically in rural Scotland, which additionally showed higher support for onshore wind power among young people.#The question posed by the surveyor should, of course, have been: #Are you opposed to further development of onshore wind #In Scotland today we have , operational turbines# that#s more than the rest of the UK put together.We also have , consented  under construction and a further , in the planning system according to an FOI response from the Scottish Government.These figures change on an almost daily basis as applications continue to pile in unabated.How many people are going to continue to support onshore wind when they witness the total annihilation of this country It would also be interesting to know exactly where the data from #rural Scotland# was collected. Was it perhaps in an area where there were no wind farms in sight of  the local communities which were questioned but where they were still able to take advantage of any community benefit on offer If successful, the public petition recently submitted to the Scottish Parliament by campaign group Scotland Against Spin should help to clary exactly how much support there really is for further onshore wind development in Scotland.Aileen Jackson, Knockglass, UplawmoorSir,I have been contacted by a number of my justiably concerned constituents about the recent removal of a cattle grid on the Isle of Gigha from the road between the ferry jetty and the village.The space has been tarred over but I have been informed by residents that unfortunately the sub surface area was just grit and so the tar has subsided due to traffic including tractors and lorries. The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid which is now mangled metal has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged the roads department should replace them with new, fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last, but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials # such as this # left behind. If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads# management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,I am a GP in one of Argyll’s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I’d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH. I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had had an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local wi and  I cannot get G on my phone.Dr Carina Spink, MuasdaleSir,Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun’s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips, owners can help to protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun’s rays.Dr Sarah Elliott, Central Veterinary Officer, Cats Protection"},{"url":null,"title":"from cradle to grave","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And their latest distancing act is to #temporarily suspend# public representation on its Integration Joint Board.I am coming to believe that this critical situation has overtaken long-held belief systems that need to be challenged.In NHS values, the first statement is #working together for patients.#That is well out of date increasingly the patient has been a participator in their care, and the duty of obtaining consent means you can’t have treatment without co-operation.This report goes on to make clear that #collaboration# is a key requirement. That means we are an essential part of the system.It seems clear that we are going to have to fight to get past the unconscious assumptions of decision makers.

We once again highlighted our concerns over a lack of immediate action on the crisis at the Rest and be ThankfulDear Roy and Hugh,I am writing in response to an official Transport Scotland email to the Rest and be Thankful Campaign on the April , where you have sought to answer several questions posed by us at our meeting with your officials and in subsequent emails to you both. We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states #we are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace# yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.We believe creating  options for consultation in November  and five further options for consultation in March was a time-wasting exercise. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report.A geological survey, which will take  months to complete, could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides.The email states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use#, yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for Transport Scotland which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in - weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay.It further declares that #we understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts#.While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment.This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside or people#s homes you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful. What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in Transport Scotland#s official reply or in recent press statements:If the next landslide, or subsequent ersion along the equally inadequate A, results in a fatality who will be held accountable Who is responsible for the social and economic impact on the people and businesses of Argyll while we wait another  years for something permanent to be done We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament.We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two km of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach.We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the Rest and be Thankful.John Gurr, chairman, The Rest and be Thankful CampaignSir,Mental Health Awareness Week opened on Monday May  and we are inviting everyone to #ConnectWithNature to support their mental health.Spending quality time in and around nature can help to reduce stress and increase feelings of positivity, and you don’t have to be surrounded by fields or have to take a walk in the wilderness to feel the benefits.The Mental Health Foundation, which works to prevent mental health problems and has organised this awareness week for the past  years, encourages you to recognise and grow your connection with nature by sharing a photo, video or sound recording with your family and friends, and on your social media.Connecting with nature can really make a dference to your mental health, and now more than ever, it is time to look after yours.Julie Walters, actorSir,Alan Reid, Dunoon"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside kids vote for nature","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

And then there#s the goats.Leaving the harbour car park, turn right and follow the road back up the hill for m.You will pass two minor roads on your right, the turning to Port Righ on your left.Continue until the school is on your left and immediately look for a forestry road to your right .Turn right on to the track, keeping the car park to your left. Ignore a small path to your right and continue to a T-junction.Turn rightpast the village playing fields, with woods to your left.

However, there now seems to be an acceptance in Transport Scotland that a new solution has to be found.In a letter to the press, George Allan points out that the -mile route from Strathlachlan to Colintraive and the eight miles between Ormidale and Tighnabruaich were designed and constructed in  or  years.I was a member of the survey and design team on these routes. I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.Philip Shimmin, Inverness.Sir,I would like to say thank you to all the lads who have been working at the Crinan Canal # often when the north winds were blowing and water was pouring down from the hills into the empty canal more quickly than the pumps were able to remove it.The men greeted me each morning as I walked past to go over the temporary bridge.

With the evenings getting longer and brighter you can use your garden or patio as a great extension to your home and just sit back and relax.It’s at this time of year that lawns need to be mowed more frequently, so here are some key pointers on getting that perfect cared-for look.Mow at least once a week and raise the mower blades when it’s very hot weather. Don’t mow when grass is wet or during a drought and don’t collect your clippings during dry spells as this helps conserve moisture.Keep watering throughout the summer unless there is a water shortage and repair bare patches with turf or re-seeding.This is also the month to ensure that all your plants are adequately fed, particularly those in baskets and tubs.Plants benefit from a regular feeding programme as they are growing vigorously and need their nutrition levels to be kept up. Slow-release granules are a good idea for pots and baskets because they last for about six months and release food as it is required into the compost.Not often thought of as a container plant, but an excellent option for small gardens, is a rose.A simple solution for June is to create an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.Just buy a selection of dferent sized pots, plant them with a ieties of roses and then place them together in a group.There is a rose for every garden situation. From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew. Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and midsummer day arrives, here are few ‘must do’ jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters a unique holiday destination","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

But never mind, Chinese astronauts, who regard a moon base as essential for probing outer space, have just about solved these problems with a bioregenerative le support system called Yuegong-, or Lunar Palace  . LP is a temperature and humidity-controlled, sealed, articial human-animal-plant-microorganism ecosystem in which oxygen, water and food sources are recycled to create an Earth-like environment. The latest experiment had LP in use continuously for a whole year, with two crews of four each having two periods of occupation and the maximum stay being  days. All emerged fit and healthy.LP comprises a living area, two cabins for growing plants , an animal-raising room housing yellow mealworms and waste treatment and storage rooms.Crew requirements # food, water, oxygen and waste disposal # are accommodated as follows: plants and mealworms provide food, the latter being processed into ‘flour’ for bread.Plant photosynthesis provides oxygen and consumes CO, while puried water from plant transpiration and condensation provides drinking and washing water.Nitrogen puried from crew urine generates plant fertiliser, while the remaining urine is puried along with waste water for plant irrigation.Crew faeces mixed with straw are fermented by bacteria to produce CO for plant photosynthesis, while fermented vegetable waste is fed to the mealworms. The whole system achieved  per cent recycling, the only non-recyclable product requiring storage being solid waste from fermented faeces.All this represents huge progress, but we are not there yet. Running LP requires massive energy input, particularly since lunar days and nights each last an Earth month, and the nights are freezing.But still, I have read of plans to build kilometre-high lunar towers bearing solar  , possible because of the moon’s zero gravity, but don’t hold your breath!* https:doi.org . ...# arxiv.org abs ."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures may 21 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

These things come with conflicting pressures on managers’ time, which is why we offer the opportunity to be part of a working group.#The performance in getting responses to surveys is something we want to improve. We have had communications about how to pick it up.#Councillor Findlay, one of three members for the Isle of Bute ward, then asked: #Should it be compulsory for managers to complete the survey #It is vital that managers lead and lead well, so I am quite disappointed by the response.#Ms Fowler replied: #We try to avoid compulsion because we are trying to work collaboratively with our colleagues. We look to get as wide a representation as we can.#Feedback to the nature of the policy itself was more positive, with SNP Helensburgh and Lomond South councillor Richard Trail saying: #I welcome this change of emphasis, changing the policy from talking about absence to supporting attendance.#This, we hope, will improve attendance, but how will we measure that in the months and years ahead  Have you any kind of measures you will be able to bring to us ##We have detailed information on what our absences have been like during Covid,# responded Ms Fowler. #We had a requirement to report on it on a weekly basis.#We will see levels of absence reported on scorecards so members can see what our rates of absence are.

His score, in fact, bettered those competing in the under- section from across Scotland.With his latest, win Connor moves up the rankings, opening the door for him to play in strokeplay events.Such is his level of skill that he plays with adult members at his home Tarbert Golf Club.

A man of few words, he prefers to do his talking on the course.Asked what the best thing is about competing in golfing competitions around the country, he replied: #You get a bacon roll.#Dad Calum, also a member at Tarbert, said: #He doesn#t say much, but he#s dedicated to his golf. He#s at his happiest when he#s playing golf.Even football has been sidelined.Calum explained: #He comes home from school, gets the golf gear on and gets out to practice, seven days a week.

Finlay this time finding the bottom corner with a neat finish for his first Red Star goal.Cardross kept battling and gave themselves a glimmer of hope with  minutes remaining when they were awarded a penalty after Star failed to clear their lines. -.The last goal of the match was the best, with an excellent passing move begun by Jake Weir in goals, worked through to Lee MacLean in midfield before eventually falling to Stuart MacLean, who got the goal that his all-round play deserved.Star saw out the game in relative comfort with the back three of Coll McCallum, Aaron Moore and Andy Weir remaining resolute throughout.Red Star welcome Dunoon Ams tomorrow, Saturday May , to Lochgilphead Joint Campus for their second of three group matches.Kick-off is at pm, with local whistler Jimmy Litster in charge."},{"url":null,"title":"the softer crofter the knapdale dude ranch experience","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The dip now is actually worse than when the cattle grid was in place.To make matters worse, the damaged cattle grid, which is now mangled metal, has been left on the adjacent roadside verge.It is my strong belief thatcattle grids are damaged, the roads department should replace them with new fit-for-propose cattle grids, not get rid of them all together.Not only should road repairs be made to last but at the very least the roads department should clean up after itself and remove old damaged materials such as this left behind.If a private company or an inidual member of the public left a large amount of scrap metal at the side of the road they would be in trouble.I have contacted our roads management through member services and asked them to recty this matter as soon as possible.I am a GP in one of Argyll#s rural practices. Last week I was having a busy morning so was a little later than usual getting back to my car, which I had left charging at an electric charge point.That evening I was surprised to see that I#d been charged £ over and above the normal charging rate per KwH.I checked through the Argyll and Bute website and discovered that there is now an overstay charge – hence the surcharge.I had received an email back in April saying that Argyll and Bute Council would now be charging users at its charge points – the cost being p per KwH. Fair enough.However, there was no mention of a penalty for overstaying. Nor is there any notice at the charge points themselves, save a tiny notice stating #charges apply#.Those seeking to charge in Argyll and Bute are additionally confused by the lack of clarity over what type of charge point is being used: is it a  Kw, Kw or a  Kw. There is no notice on the chargers. This is important because the overstay timings y according to the dfering units.When I buy petrol at a filling station, I clearly know what the charges are when I buy a ticket at a parking meter, I buy a ticket and know exactly how long I am able to park there.But it seems that for electric vehicles you have to search the internet to find out the rules – and in my village there is no local WiFi and I cannot get G on my phone.As a responsible democrat I thought, when this election was called, that I would write to the candidates to ask them a few questions before deciding how to vote.We had no hustings this time, even in Campbeltown, and our MSP has not visited the town for ages. So election time seems to be the only opportunity to enter into dialogue with those who want to represent us.Last year I published a book about the uncertain future for the rule of law in Scotland. The irreducible basis of a rule-of-law society is reciprocity between those who make the laws and those who have to obey them. Without dialogue, that is impossible.Only two parties sent me a leaflet with enough time to allow an exchange of emails: first the SNP and then the LibDems.I started by asking the SNP candidate, Jenni Minto, for a CV. That was initially refused, then a redacted one sent. Next, I asked about the Hate Crime Act. I got a long answer ending with a quotation from the English philosopher, Karl Popper: #In order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant to intolerance.#I wrote back quoting Bertrand Russell, who said that enforced morality is not morality at all it is pure obedience. Likewise, enforced tolerance is not tolerance, just obedience. I asked what she thought of the criminalisation of dinner-time conversations and other aspects of the Act. It was at that point that the dialogue broke down.I changed the subject to independence. This time I did get a reply, but it was evasive.For example, I had asked what the most important features of the UK were that made her want Scotland to leave it. Ms Minto replied that an independent country would get the government it votes for. That implied thatScotland and England voted for the same party, there would be no need for independence. So, by extension, whatArgyll wanted a dferent government from that in Holyrood  Should it declare independence from Scotland, as Orkney and Shetland have said they willthe UK breaks up  I wrote for clarication, but Ms Minto did not reply.I also wrote to Alan Reid of the LibDems. He sent a CV, but when I replied to that with questions about LibDem policy, I heard nothing more.That, in Scotland, appears to be the limit of dialogue between the rulers and the ruled. Perhaps that explains something about the parliament itself.With Sun Awareness Week taking place this week, Cats Protection would like to advise cat owners to be aware of the risks posed to their cat by the sun.Pale-coloured cats, or those with unpigmented white noses or ears, are particularly at risk from the sun#s rays which can cause sunburn and skin cancer.Those affected can suffer long-term damage including, in severe cases, having to have their ear tips removed to prevent the cancer from spreading.Following a few simple tips owners can help protect their cat from the harmful effects of the sun.These include keeping them indoors on sunny days between am and pm, asking your vet for advice about suitable sunscreen and ensuring you provide plenty of shade to enable your cat to shelter from the sun#s rays."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week may 7 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

Yet, at the same time, we are becoming increasingly suspicious that the label on freedom has been switched.For some people appear to be devaluing freedom. They seem to think it means no constraints on their behaviour. They have the right to do whatever they want, evenit causes damage to themselves, to others and to the environment.Jesus makes it clear that freedom is something quite dferent. It is being set free from the tyrannical oppression of our own self-centredness – what the Bible calls sin – empowering us to be free to love God by willingly obeying his Word and to love others by humbly looking out for their best interests.Not only did Jesus tell us in his teaching and show us by his example what label freedom should have, but by his real death on the cross, his physical and historical resurrection and the gt of his Spirit, he made it possible for us to experience it.We must not be conned by the switch that has been made to freedom#s label.Instead, let us restore its label back to its correct, Jesus-defined and le-changing setting, and through faith in Jesus alone, value and enjoy the freedom he secured by his death."},{"url":null,"title":"enjoy running a mok but please do so safely","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We are hugely disappointed by this response and its apparent contradictions.We asked for a permanent solution within the next three years. The email states: #We are not waiting for anything and are pushing on with work at pace#, yet your actions since the August landslide have only created delay.Creating  options for consultation in November , this, we believe, is a time-wasting exercise. Five further options for consultation in March. We strongly believe there are only three real options, with studies on these completed in your  report. Conducting a geological survey which will take eighteen months to complete, a process that could have started last August, assuming you had not conducted such surveys in .We have asked for temporary use of the forestry road, away from the threats posed by landsides. It also states: #We were clear without that information we are not certain the forestry track in its current form is safe for use.# Yet we would argue you already have a Transerv report produced in  by Balfour Beatty and Mouchal Services Ltd for TS which suggested the forestry road could be upgraded in  to  weeks. How did Transerv arrive at this conclusion without a study of the ground conditions being done in advance This situation should be considered a safety, economic and social emergency, cutting through the red tape of consultation and delay. It further declares: #We understand first-hand the delay that can be caused by procedural challenge…there needs to be a careful balancing of accelerating development and procedural risk in order to ensure that we do not end up in the courts.#While we understand the need for the right balance of speed and consultation, we think the safety risks, costs incurred by business and damage to the economy of Argyll, should create the conditions for emergency action, delivering what should be a simple road realignment. This is not HS, we are not asking to blight the countryside, or people#s homes, you do not have whole communities ready to challenge fixing the crisis at RABT.What we want cannot be worse than the damage already inflicted on the hillside without consultation. If you fixed the Rest, we will all be thankful.The following questions still have not been answered in TS#s official reply or in recent press statements:We are business people and understand the need for safe environments, effective procedures, timely management, and cost control, but what we have experienced over the past year does not give us confidence you will address the concerns we have.We are not looking for you to defend your approach, what matters to us is the action taken to bring timescales down and resolve the problem within the next parliament. We are simply asking you to rethink your approach, look at how your team can cut through this #business as usual# process and appoint someone who can find a way to realign two kilometres of the A safely within the next three years.By challenging your approach, we are hoping to see that after nearly a year of delay and ersion, there is a recognition of the cost impact to business, the signicant safety concerns, and that this will continue to blight Argyll as a place to live, work, and invest in until a permanent solution is delivered.We will be working with the relevant politicians post elections and will continue to campaign for a change in approach. We would be happy to discuss what can be done to overcome any constraints you have to deliver a solution quickly and resolve the crisis at the RABT.We stand at a once-in-a-generation crossroads.Earlier this week, a thought-provoking poem, ACCEPTABLE  by the Anonymous Mother # judged for needing a food bank to feed her child # started a nationwide debate about whether the world#s fth richest country should need food banks to feed children.This conversation needed to happen as our food bank crisis has become critical.Last year food banks in the Trussell Trust#s network handed out , emergency food parcels for children in the UK. This surely cannot be acceptable.However, fate has given us a rare opportunity, as history shows us that the best time to create a brighter future is after times of great darkness.The pandemic has been the most devastating event to hit our country since the Second World War, but it also brought out the very best of our nation.We recognised our real community heroes, we protected the vulnerable, we didn#t stand by when kids went hungry.But now, as we prepare to wake up from the pandemic nightmare, millions of British families still cannot afford food on their table.As the Anonymous Mother poetically says # it doesn#t need to be this way.In , Britain woke up to its new dawn at a similar crossroads # go back to the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to make things better.That great generation chose hope, and created a better, fairer society for all # including founding the NHS.This pandemic has been our generation#s darkest hour. This is now our new dawn, our choice. Will we choose the old broken way, or use this golden opportunity to eradicate hunger in the UK I urge you to do just one thing today, and that is to seek out the poem that started all of this, and reflect.If, afterwards, you agree with me and the hundreds of thousands of other supporters of the Trussell Trust, that we can do better, join us as we collectively create a #hunger free future#."},{"url":null,"title":"safety first as shops reopen","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It#s a really exciting move as it offers the potential to climb the Scottish football pyramid.#From the club#s point of view, we want to find our standard amongst the new teams joining the set up.#We want to be the best we can be as the senior team of the Campbeltown and District Community Football Club.#With our acceptance into the WoSFL, we can offer a pathway for the youngest age groups right through to the under- side, being trained by Stuart Crossan, into our first team, representing Campbeltown in non-league football.#With that, it#s important to acknowledge the huge amount of hard work that has gone into making Campbeltown#s community club a Gold Merit Award holder, one of only seven clubs in the Scottish Football AssociationWest region, encompassing all of Glasgow and the west. This accolade was a major factor in our acceptance into the WoSFL.#Other factors in the Pupils# favour before WoSFL committee scrutiny included having changing facilities for two teams of up to  players each, a separate referee#s room, and an enclosed ground with spectator barriers.Campbell said of the club#s Kintyre Park home: #The renovation of the pavilion is nearing completion, through a fundraising campaign led by club chairman Alex McKinven.#Campbell added: #The SAFL was a great  for us to play competitive amateur football for  years. In periods, we went through some wilderness years but we have happy memories of successful title-winning seasons, too.#In recent seasons, however, the club became disillusioned with how the league was going, with dficulty getting referees and sometimes teams to travel to Kintyre at a week#s notice – this was not a feature against even rival teams in years gone by.#In the WosFL, our geography could not be a determining factor in league entry as we are SFA West region members, which meant that the criteria we could meet on a match day, and the quality of our community club pathway, mattered most.#Meanwhile, the Pupils are gearing up for le in the WoSFL with contact training resuming on Tuesday evening.The team have been training twice weekly in a non-contact setting to build up their base fitness since March.Campbell added: #Training has been well attended, led by coaches Norman Thomson and Lewis Mackay, and although it has been hard to get the players together with ongoing restrictions, the squad are right behind the move and excited about the challenge ahead.#Campbeltown Pupils are keen to hear from anyone who would be able to help with ground and park maintenance.

As German troops advanced through Normandy, the st fought valiantly, protecting French citizens, hoping evacuation by sea would be forthcoming.On June  , German tanks surrounded the ision at the French fishing port of St Valéry. This, alongside a curtain of heavy fog, made the long-awaited flotilla rescue unviable and they were forced to surrender. Those who were not killed in the fighting were captured as prisoners of war and marched to camps in Eastern Europe, where they remained for five gruelling years.Following the commemorations to mark the th anniversary of the battle last June, a remarkable story has emerged. One brave soldier miraculously evaded capture and was taken in by a French family who hid him from the occupying German forces.#We were contacted by Monsieur Patrick Prieur, a -year-old St Valéry resident whose grandparents and father remained in the town during the entirety of the war. He told us the story of the escapee and the tragedy that befell him,# said Dr Claire Armstrong, chief executive of Legion Scotland.#As we approach the st anniversary of the battle, we hope to identy this Scottish hero, give him the recognition he deserves and bring peace to his family.#Patrick Prieur recalled the tale his late father told him: #A soldier from the st Highland Division was hidden by a family in the village. They bonded and the family learned he was a married man with a we and two daughters waiting for him tohome.#For several weeks, the soldier remained hidden but, regretfully, he was eventually discovered by German troops and marched through the town to the municipal cemetery.#After being forced to dig his own grave, he was positioned against the cemetery wall and shot. His death deeply upset the townspeople, who had been aware of his hiding, and especially my father, who was only  at the time.#In later years, the Franco-British military cemetery was built and his body was moved there. His grave is marked as #Known unto God# and my father and other villagers tended to it for decades after the war ended.#Monsieur Prieur added: #My father had been gted a piece of paper on which the soldier#s name was written, #Keller Len Scott#, and this became his prized possession. He desperately wanted to find the soldier#s family to tell them what had happened to their beloved and where he was laid to rest, but having very little information, he struggled.#In  my father passed away and, being eager to finish what he started, I recently contacted Poppyscotland and the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association to ask for help.#Michelle McKearnon, head of engagement at the Highland Reserve Forces# and Cadets# Association, said: #We started to do our own research to unearth the fallen soldier#s identity but only got so far. We believe the name order on the piece of paper may have been written in military fashion, with the surname preceding any given names, so the family name might be Keller.#We#re now at an impasse, struggling to find additional information through our own resources, so we need the knowledge of the wider community to continue our efforts.#Dr Armstrong added: #We are urging anyone who believes they know of or has any information about our #Unknown Soldier#, no matter how small, to get in touch.#This brave man fought valiantly for his country and to repay our debt to him for his service would be an honour, not only for Legion Scotland as custodians of remembrance, but for his family, Monsieur Prieur#s father, the people of St Valéry and, ultimately, for all the #unknown soldiers# who sacriced their lives for us.#Anyone with information that could help identy the soldier should visit poppyscotland.org.uk stvalery"},{"url":null,"title":"engines at the ready mach 1 stages rally gets go ahead","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

They did notto the harbour until after pm with the casualty in tow.The following day, Sceptre skipper Tom Smith praised the hard work and efficiency of the Campbeltown leboat crews.Diver Robert Lamont, a member of the leboat crew the night before, went in and removed the damaged rudder ready for Sceptre to be towed by tug to Troon, the finish of the race.The race sails from Oban to Mull, Jura and Arran then Troon, stopping at each island for a team of runners to complete a hill race.Sceptre, with a crew of four, was carrying the boys# team from Glenalmond School, Perth.She had run aground the night before entering Craighouse, Jura. Everything looked fine on the yacht, which was built in Argyll at Alexander Robertson#s Holy Loch yard to compete in the America#s Cup of .#As a precaution, we did not have the boys on board for the tough leg round the Mull of Kintyre to Arran,# said crew member Roger Finbow.#They haven#t missed the race they were on board Blue Damsel, carrying the girls# team.#The decision proved a wise move as not only did the rudder come loose leaving the yacht with no steering, it was flapping wildly and in danger of damaging the hull.As a precaution, the leboat crew put a heavy-duty pump on board but this was not needed.HMS Dragon broke off her sea trials to come to the aid of Sceptre. The Type  Clyde-built destroyer stood by until the leboat arrived.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOCalls were mounting earlier this week for a Scottish Office decision on the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Northern Ireland.The Scottish Office has been considering a business plan for state-owned Caledonian MacBrayne to operate the link with Ballycastle in Northern Ireland since the beginning of February.The company needs Scottish Office permission to become involved in the project.But concern is growing that unless a decision is made soon the necessary harbour work at Campbeltown will not start until it is too late for the service to begin next year.Two Campbeltown ambulance men were among six from Argyll recently presented with long service and good conduct medals by the Duke of Argyll.Ronnie Hamilton and Malcolm Black travelled to Oban for the presentation, carried out by the Duke on behalf of HM Queen.The medals are not awarded automatically but are made on the recommendation of a special .The Duke told the ambulance men: #What you do is not a profession, it is a vocation.#He also paid tribute to their families, pointing out the ambulance men worked anti-social hours for long periods at a time.FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown was #switched on# to colour television on Tuesday by the town#s new Provost, William Craig, in his first official engagement.The service has been brought to Campbeltown by Redfusion, the firm which pipes television to several thousand subscribers from its mast at Crosshill Farm.The firm#s Scottish general manager Mr Colin Payne said that Redfusion offers a public service of which they were proud.#We looked at the television problems here. There were just BBC and STV and occasionally Ulster in the town.#We said can we bring to Campbeltown the full range of colour programmes which are available where and the answer to that was #yes#.#There are now six programmes on the system. There aren#t many places in the country which can receive this.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAn English steam liner which called in here for bait one day last week had full bunkers and a plentul reserve of coal in ious corners. She had gone to Ostende for the fuel.A further restriction of the gas supply in the burgh comes into force on Saturday night. The hours during which there will be reduced and normal pressure respectively are given in advertisement.The local branch of the Miners# Union opened a subscription list this week for the purpose of starting a communal soup kitchen. It is not intended, of course, to confine the benefits of the scheme to miners or their dependents. Over £ has already been raised and the committee intend to publish the list of subscriptions next week.A welcome break in our comparative isolation from the mainland was made at the beginning of the week when the steamer Kinloch made a special run to the upper reaches, with mail, passengers and cargo.Many merchants, not only in Campbeltown but at Carradale and the west of Arran ports, were carrying very low stocks and this run was not made a day too soon to prevent absolute scarcity of not a few necessities.Flour, for one thing, was running very short, and the new supplies got by bakers were very much-needed.Alcohol is again tipped as a likely rival to petrol. The new motor fuel is being produced by the Distillers Company Ltd and consists of a mixture of  per cent of alcohol,  per cent of benzole and  per cent of paraffin.

I was also involved in the construction of  miles of the A between Perth and Inverness in  years. These civil engineering schemes demonstrate what can be achieved when there is real political will and commitment to prioritise projects.I realise Transport Scotland has its own procedures for appointing consultants for the design processes and there are detailed environmental impact assessments to be done. It does, however, seem to me that its programming of the Rest and Be Thankful improvement is completely lacking in ambition.As a former director of roads and transport in Highland, perhaps I may be permitted to comment on the long-term solution.I would saythere are no geological features found on the other side of the glen which will cause a repeat of current problems, then the construction of a new road in ersion would cause less disruption to traffic than trying to form landslip shelters or tunnels adjacent to the existing carriageway.The main thing though is for Transport Scotland and their political masters to just get on with it.This week, Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulancemarks its eighth anniversary – after a year like no other.Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, our Helimed crews have never missed a beat maintaining our emergency helicopter air ambulance service across Scotland#s mainland and island communities. In fact we#ve enhanced our service with the launch of a new aircraft – Helimed  in Aberdeen last year – which has already had a huge impact on pre-hospital care in the Grampian, Highland and island regions.In our busiest year ever, our aircrew have endured challenging working conditions, with additional procedures and cumbersome protective and safety equipment as they go about an already dficult and stressful job.But they#re not complaining – this is what the Scottish public ask of them, to save and improve lives, wherever the need arises, and they fulfil their role with courage and pride.Our exemplary performance during this national crisis has been a tribute to how far SCAA has come in just eight years and I, for one, am immensely proud of what the SCAA team has achieved.But our operational teams are acutely aware that we are only able to provide this critical service, thanks to the continued public donations which you have maintained throughout these dficult times. So you are the real heroes in our charity.SCAA is the people#s helicopter – funded by the people of Scotland, for the people of Scotland – and our two frontline aircraft are stood by ready to help you, your family, your friends, colleagues, neighbours or anyone in your community when you most need us.As we mark our eighth birthday on May , we are asking the people of Scotland,they can, to support us into the future. Any donation, however small, to celebrate our anniversary will help to save a le – just like the numerous lives we have already saved over almost , missions.SCAA vows to continue to transform emergency care in Scotland, particularly to our rural and island communities, with your support. Thank you.As a coalition of leading providers of care and support to vulnerable children and young people, we congratulate all MSPs on their election and welcome the consensus there is between the major political parties to tackle the growing mental health crisis in our young people.We have for some time raised concerns over a potential lost generation of vulnerable children and young people, whose mental health is being impacted even further by the Covid- pandemic.There have been dramatically increased waiting times for mental health treatment during lockdown.In December , for example,  per cent of children and young people had been waiting more than a year for specialist treatment, compared with . per cent in , a truly frightening statistic.A commitment by MSPs to focus on mental health, increasing investment in support services and intervention strategies, must be a priority for this parliament, giving our young people the care and support they need, when they need it.The frightening statistics on the deteriorating mental health of many young people presents a compelling case for a radical new plan for our struggling mental health services and for a national crusade to address what is a mental health pandemic, underpinned by considerably greater resourcing.This is a crisis we can overcome, but it will require a similar energy and commitment to that demonstrated for Covid-we are to achieve this and prevent many young people giving up on their futures.At sight loss charity RNIB Scotland, we are concerned the Covid- crisis might have impacted on people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older.We would like to highlight the emotional reassurance and practical help we offer during the coronavirus lockdown and its aftermath.Covid has eclipsed all other health news in the past year but  people still start to lose their sight in Scotland every week. Add to that stress over Covid and the lockdowns and there could be more people needing support and reassurance.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute and the Western Highlands for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as families, friends and carers.Losing your sight can be devastating news to take in. But our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.The uncertainty during the Covid lockdown over access to basic shopping and medication, a lack of information in accessible formats, the social isolation, the barriers to being guided because of social distancing # these have all added to and compounded the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.But we want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.To contact the Need to Talk service, phone the RNIB Helpline on    or email needtotalk@rnib.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 21 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

A year later in London she met the Russian poet Irina Ratushinskaya, released from a labour camp in the USSR where she had been imprisoned for her Christian faith.Denied paper, she wrote poems on soap bars. In one poem she wrote:Believe me, it was often thus:I have never forgotten that extraordinary poem. How far can kindness reach In Mid Argyll there is a group of people who offer prayers for anyone who asks. You don#t have to be #religious# – whatever that means – to ask.

From hybrid teas to miniatures, climbers to floribundas, the choice is endless.Roses are easy to grow and will thrive in most soil types, providing there is good drainage.They prefer a position that is sunny and not too exposed and need regular feeding which will improve their resistance to pests and disease, although some roses will require spraying to combat aphids and mildew.Pruning is also important to remove dead heads and improve flowering over a longer period of time.If you are replacing old roses with new ones, ensure that the old soil is removed and replaced with fresh soil.As the temperature rises and Midsummer#s Day arrives, here are few #must do# jobs for the garden this month from the Royal Horticultural Society:CAPTION:June is the perfect month for creating an instant rose garden that you can enjoy throughout the summer.

This provided learners with the opportunity to see new words and phrases and gave fluent speakers the chance to use Gaelic outside the classroom.It was the young learners who really caught the judges# attention though, with their production, Èirich.Èirich tells the story of a social media trend that transports people into a dangerous new world, with some students caught in an infinite loop and others caught by the #person in the shadows#.Councillor Robin Currie, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, said: #Every year this competition attracts a huge number of high quality entries from learners across Scotland, and it is an honour that our young people made it to the final.#These talented filmmakers from Islay High School have created two exceptional productions and I#m very, very proud of them.#Gaelic has played an important role in the history of Argyll and Bute for many, many years and we#re committed to continuing to promote the language and its culture to our communities.#Gaelic education is offered in more than  of our primary schools and five secondary schools.#There has been an increase in interest in Gaelic Medium Education, which will have a positive impact on future generations of Gaelic speakers.

Mr Mitchell acknowledged receipt of these answers.I was alarmed and saddened by the headline #Failing# school is #betraying# pupils and the community# in last week#s Courier.Coming from a retired Campbeltown Grammar Schoolteacher, it is hard to believe that someone who has worked in the profession could have such criticism for his her fellow colleagues.Although clearly passionate about the future of CGS, perhaps retirement has helped this inidual forget what a challenging job all school staff face.It is commonly known that CGS has not had its troubles to seek in recent years with major staff shortages due to ill health and other unforeseen circumstances.The league tables do not make good reading but, on their own, I don#t think they reflect the efforts of the staff.It is a well known fact that you can take a horse to water but you cannot make it drink. Is the behaviour of pupils the greatest barrier to success Despite the efforts of teachers to discipline the pupils, there are few deterrents for the offenders, especially where the pupil is aware that,they ask, the parent will fight their corner instead of backing the school.The responsibility of teaching our children to behave and respect others needs to be instilled from early years by us all and not just when the child reaches CGS.Maybe the retired teacher should offer his her skills and visit CGS and see the problems that all staff are facing It is time for the community to pull together and support our school and encourage our children to believe that a good education is very achievable in CGS.Recently, an investigation by the Herald newspaper uncovered that #just over half of Scotland#s leline ferry network is operating outwith its working le expectancy#, with  vessels out of  in operation over  years old.Despite the huge challenges created by the Covid- pandemic that our hard-working ferry crews have to deal with,  residents rightly expect a high quality ferry service that runs on time and has enough space to ensure they can travel to and from the islands, businesses can transport goods to the mainland and tourists can visit our islands to boost the economy.Unfortunately, cancellations and delays continue to plague routes. I have been working closely with residents, our community councils and other parties to find long-term solutions.This pressing matter simply can#t be left on the backburner.The  National Lottery Awards are now open for entries.Once again, the annual search for the UK#s favourite National Lottery-funded people and projects will recognise those iniduals and organisations who have made an extraordinary impact in their community – especially during these unprecedent times.National Lottery players raise £ million every week for good causes and we know this money is being used in amazing and inspiring ways.As part of The National Lottery Awards, we want to celebrate those whose selfless dedication and fantastic work makes such a dference in villages, towns and cities across the country.Encompassing all areas of National Lottery funding, you nominate local legends and hometown heroes in the following categories: culture, arts and film, community charity, heritage and sport.In addition, there will be a young hero award for someone under the age of .Groups or organisations are eligible to enter The National Lottery Project of the Year category, where shortlisted finalists will face a public vote later in the year.All award winners will receive an iconic National Lottery Awards trophy and £, for their organisation.Nominations can be made by completing an entry form on our website at www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk awards.All nominees must have been funded by The National Lottery or be associated with a National Lottery funded project.

Play is a hugely important part of childhood and has a whole host of benefits, including improving physical and mental health and wellbeing.Throughout this pandemic, children have had to deal with so many dficult challenges some having to stay in unsafe homes and many living with families who are struggling with health worries and financial issues.Children have told Childline that they have struggled to cope and their mental health has suffered as a result.It doesn#t matter how people choose to play this Childhood Day , whether it#s organising a sponsored kickabout in the park, a game of cards, a musical get-together or an online gaming tournament, we just want as many as possible playing and raising money to help us keep children safe.We look forward to hearing how your readers plan to support the NSPCC and children across Scotland this Childhood Day.To find out more and download a fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or search online for NSPCC Childhood Day."},{"url":null,"title":"look out little explorers about","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is a big commitment for the school, requiring  hours of #on site# work.After finding out about Scottish-born American naturalist John Muir, his love for nature and his environmental work, the children mapped along their nearest beach and undertook a beach clean.Nearby, the pupils discovered a trig point and a lookout or watchtower.They are interested in finding out more about Kintyre#s lookout towers and are appealing to Courier readers with any information or stories to send them letters to: Rhunahaorine Primary School, Tayinloan, Tarbert, PA XG.Some of the children are also interested in the rocks on the beach beside the lookout tower at Rhunahaorine.They collected ious examples and took turns smashing them in the hope of finding geodes – crystals or other mineral matter – inside. They discovered lots of interesting patterns but no real geodes – this is perhaps a lelong project for some.Other pupils are interested in the shells and crabs on the beach. Crabs #body parts# are often collected and it is deemed a good finda moveable claw or leg can be worked.During one visit, the youngsters searched for shark egg cases and, after what seemed to be a fruitless hunt, more than  were found in one morning when their eyes became accustomed to what they were searching for. Their findings were submitted to the Shark Trust.Head teacher Catriona Brown told the Courier she was #very impressed# with the children#s enthusiasm and commitment throughout the project so far.Mrs Brown hopes to be able to share in the near futureany of the children achieve the award."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week may 28 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

James VI also came to the Bass in  as a guest of a later Lauder he liked the island so much that he offered to purchase it, but here he was snubbed.During the reign of Charles II, the Bass became a notorious prison, mainly used for the Covenanters.As many as  of these religious dissidents were held on the island, under appalling conditions: there was a well that produced fresh water, but fresh meat was a scarcity and the fishy taste of the seabirds was a torment to the wretched prisoners.In , four Jacobite officers were imprisoned on the Bass but they successfully took over control of the island and ordered the garrison to depart. After reinforcements had been received, they withstood a siege of nearly three years, under trying conditions, before they surrendered with full military honours in May .The Bass later passed into the ownership of the Dalrymple family, to which it still belongs today.The Bass Rock lighthouse was constructed in  by the celebrated engineer David Stevenson, a cousin of Robert Louis. He made sure that parts of the old castle were demolished for the stone to be harvested to build the -metre lighthouse, which served its purpose well for many years to come.It was lit with gas derived from vaporised paraffin oil for many years, monitored by the lighthouse keeper.Since , when the lighthouse was converted to electricity and remotely controlled, the lighthouse keeper was no longer needed, and the Bass Rock has been without any permanent human resident.From his house lsquoRockstowesrsquo on Melbourne Road, the celebrated postcard artist Reginald Phillimore enjoyed uninterrupted views of the Bass Rock.He had a fascination with the island, visited it many times and wrote a guidebook that he published himself.The Bass Rock is home to the largest gannet colony in the world: , birds spend their summer residence here, having been in Africa for the winter.The gannet, or lsquosolan goosersquo as it was known in Phillimorersquos time, is a large and formidable-looking seabird, with a white body, a yellow neck and head, and black and white speckled wings and tail.The reason that much of the Bass Rock appears white from a distance is the sheer number of birds and their acrid droppings.The gannet hunts fish by ing headlong into the sea, as any visitor to the Bass Rock can observe at close range.The air is full of birds, which are squawking cacophonously, and the smell from their droppings is very noticeable.Phillimore made some beautul postcards featuring the Bass Rock gannets he is likely to have travelled to the island from Canty Bay or on a vessel from North Berwick, but nowadays access to the Bass can be arranged via the Scottish Seabird Centre.This is an edited extract from Jan Bondesonrsquos book R.P.

Im on an electric bike and that bead slipping down my cheek is most certainly rain ndash even on the steepest of South Devon hills, Ive barely broken a sweat.Its my second morning in the South Hams region of Devon, located between Torbay and Plymouth and bordering the Dartmoor National Park to the north. Its an all-day drive from Scotland down the M but worth it when you get there, especiallyyou break your journey on the way down and back. There are flights from Glasgow and Edinburgh to Exeter and the train is always an option.Its an area with a strong rural and maritime heritage, where sandy beaches rub up against rich coastal grasslands. And its so pretty, its a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty .Naturally beautul it may be, but exploring on two wheels has largely lacked appeal to the average South Devon visitor, due to the relentless and often steep hills. Thankfully, e-Xplore Devonhave made cycling here more accessible .There are suggested cycling routes on the e-Xplore website, and the -mile Beach Circuit is a delicious amble along coastal roads and through quaint villages. I dismount in the tiny hamlet of Thurlestone and admire its th century thatched roofs and its glorious bay , before continuing to Bolberry Down, a long stretch of rugged coastline.The route continues east and I refuel at The Winking Prawn , a family-run seafood restaurant on Salcombe North Sands beach. Beer fans should order the aptly named Prawn Juice, which is brewed in partnership with the South Hams Brewery.I continue on my cycle and initiate turbo mode, mainly because Im full of garlic prawns and dont fancy a stitch. The route flanks the Salcombe estuary ndash its vibrant blue waters punctuated with small white sailing boats ndash before turning back inland. I finish back at the e-Xplore showroom in Kingsdown and space permitting, you can leave your car there whilst you cycle. The crew at e-Xplore can also drop your bike directly to your accommodation.The rainy weather and long cycle have me craving some home comforts, so I head back to my rustic but extremely cosy shepherds hut. Located at the Salcombe Shepherds Hutsare an excellent choiceyou want a slightly more luxurious camping experience. The four huts are handcrafted using local and sustainable wood, and each includes a log burner , and a fully-equipped kitchen.Im in the Foxes Den which has an en-suite toilet , a comfy double bed , and a small leather couch. I enjoy my morning coffee at the picnic table with its views of the Kingsbridge Estuary and flocks of sheep grazing in the surrounding fields.The next morning Im zipping along country roads to Bigbury-on-Sea, where Im booked in for a surfing lesson with Discovery Surf School . All equipment is provided and Im thankful for a super-thick wetsuit, as the temperature is barely hitting double digits.We start on the beach as Matt, our instructor, guides us through the basics. Were soon in the water and Matts constant encouragement fills us with enthusiasm and motivation, even after numerous wipeouts. Slowly but surely we start to stand, unsteady but feeling accomplished. There are just three of us in my group, but the maximum size is six, so expect lots of useful feedback .Catching tiny waves makes me hungry and I drive the  minutes to Hope Cove, an old fishing village with two sheltered beaches . I settle in at the Lobster Pod Bistrowhich youll find perched on the hillside above Harbour Beach. I gorge on the Seafood Platter, which includes todays catch , alongside potted crab, prawns and a selection of salads.Visitors can sit on outdoor benches or self-contained podsand all have views of the ocean and the grassy Bolt Tail headland . I spend the next hour marvelling over the view. The sun has made an appearance and Im lapping it up with a pint of Salcombe Pale Ale .The small town of Salcombe is one of South Devons most popular , and its independent shops, award-winning restaurants and waterside cafes make it worth a day or two of exploring.Parking can be hectic, so leave the car at your shepherds hut and jump on the number  Tally Ho! bus from Yarde Gate Nursery . Alternatively, you can take the scenic, but extremely hilly, -minute walk into town via the village of Batson.Gin fans should visit the Salcombe Distilling Co. , located on Island Street. Every bottle of Salcombe Gin is distilled here using a single copper still . Tasting sessions include a tour and lots of samples .The distillery also runs a Gin School, which allows visitors to create their own bespoke gin recipe. Youll take charge of a miniature copper under the watchful eye of an expert distiller, who will guide you through the process of choosing botanicals and naming your unique creation. Take your bottle home or enjoy it at the waterside Distillery Bar .Along the street from the distillery, youll find the Salcombe Dairy , which has been churning ice cream for over  years. Over half a million litres of the stuff is pasteurised, churned and packaged each year beneath their shop on Island Street, and theyve recently started making bean to bar chocolate as well. Must-try ice cream flavours include Honeycomband Rum and Raisin .My final evening is spent at waterside restaurant Dick and Wills . Its April and UK government guidelines mean were sitting outside in the freezing wind, but luckily the team are on hand with heaters. The salad from my Asian chilli beef starter gets blown into the estuary, but my main course, a Prime Devonshire steak burger topped with vintage cheddar and a side of chips, proves to be a sturdier and equally delicious option.The rain arrives, but Ive learnt to embrace it this time, because its not a British trip to the seaside without a healthy serving of wind, rain and, well, soggy chips.For details of places to stay, visit or experience in and around Salcombe, visit salcombeinformation."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12632370.jpg?type=article-full","title":"portfolio-tatjana-patitz-le-touquet-1986-peter-lindbergh","story":"Alaiarsquos body-fitting yet flattering clothes and Lindberghrsquos striking black and white photographs were essential components of the careers of Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Tatjana Patitz and Naomi Campbell, who even slept in Alaiarsquos workshop when she arrived in Paris, aged .Both men found each other in their adopted city of Paris and began to work together, sharing a love of monotone and strong women. ldquoWe met in , I believe.

But even as businesses contemplate reopening they must remember that change is unsettling and ato \"normal\" may feel anything but to employees.Throughout lockdown, we carried out surveys to gauge how clients saw their businesses changing as restrictions tightened. And now, as they ease, many businesses acknowledge that office le will undergo signicant change.Accommodating flexible working means some fundamental aspects might be lost and others added. Hygiene stations and \"Zoom spaces\" are set to become part of office design, but the days of personal desks for every employee are numbered. And while this is a logical approach to flexible working, the wise business will bring their employees with them on the change journey, before implementing it.Physical space has to support, and be aligned with, new working practices, rather than the other way round. Whether existing space is reconfigured or new offices acquired, it is vital to engage with employees on how best to use the new space to reduce old working practices or workarounds creeping back in.We love our own desks, but our experience is that inidual desk \"ownership\" leads to a lot of empty desks. The loss of a space to call your own can be unsettling for iniduals, no matter how logical it might be for the business as a whole. Thought and consultation is needed to make \"hot-desking\" accepted. Some solutions might include personal storage or locker spaces, appropriate portable technology and providing smaller, more flexible private spaces where telephone calls or remote meetings can take place without disruption.Numerous figures have been reported with regards to future space requirementand some organisations have declared the end of the office altogether, stating that their people can work from home indefinitely. Time will tell what the actual change will be.One thing cannot be denied. People want to get back to their offices primarily to interact once more with their colleagues. The informal knowledge-sharing that comes from everyone sharing a workspace cannot be replicated through remote links alone. The sense of belonging that comes from feeling part of something bigger, and an understanding of a business culture and ethos relies on observation and interaction. This is especially true for new starts and junior staff.Physical workspace changes, which might be cost-saving can have other costs in terms of workplace happiness and productivity. So as workplaces open, the transition will ultimately be so much better for those companies that make spatial design decisions that support how their employees want to work, bring staff into the change process and not impose it upon them.Phil Muir is Group Director Consultancy and Design, SPACE"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12623330.jpg?type=article-full","title":"kevin-mckenna-cummings-statements-reveal-covid-19-response-shambolic","story":"THE question by Rebecca Long-Bailey in todayrsquos evidence session of the Health and Social Care Committee cut to the heart of the UKrsquos shambolic response to Coronavirus.The Labour MP asked Dominic Cummings about his tweet last week that pointed to ldquodestructive behaviour in the political system.

The kilt is made from one eight-yard stretch of material and the skill is chalking it so you know exactly where to put the pleats. The whole thing takes a skilled person about eight hours at least.The problem ndash and itrsquos the same with sporrans ndash is there are lots of cheap imports around, which has put the traditional craft under pressure. Kilt making by hand has now been added to the endangered list kept by the Heritage Crafts Association along with the likes of arrowsmithing, flintknapping, and lorinery. What it means is these wonderful traditions could disappear altogether.:Cummings paints surreal picture of goings-on at dysal Number  ndash Westminster sketchIn some ways though, it does seem strange that the threat to traditional kilt-making should come up now. The kilt has never been so ubiquitous, but maybe a lot of men think the lighter, cheaper kilt is easier to wear and lug about. The cost of a hand-made kilt can also be daunting ndash these days, you can easily pay more than pound,.The other problem with kilts is that,you do get one, it comes with a lot of baggage and attitude, some of which is a load of rubbish. For many, the kilt is the standardised vision of Scotland, but they werenrsquot always so common. My parents married in the s and it didnrsquot even cross my fatherrsquos mind to wear a kilt. I also spoke to the historian Patrick Watt about tartan and his experience was similar. Dr Watt, who was curator of modern history at the National Museum of Scotland, told me his dad did wear a kilt at his wedding in  but people asked what he was doing. ldquoLots of people wear kilts now, he said, ldquobut itrsquos a recent thing ndash in the last  years.No doubt, some of this recent enthusiasm for kilts has something to do with the recent enthusiasm for independence, the idea being that kilts are a link to national identity, rebellion or a form of modern-day Jacobitism. But all Irsquod say to that is: check your history. It may not be true, as some people think, that Highland dress was invented by Walter Scott, but the modern romantic image was popularised and spread by Queen Victoria. And check out this fact: at Culloden, there were kilted solders on both sides.Read more:Rosemary Goring: Battle royal looms as William and Kate deployed to bolster the UnionThe idea of clan tartans, which is also associated with kilts, is a modern obsession too, and an irritating one. Traditionally, people mixed and matched tartans, but now therersquos an idea that you should wear your clan tartan and,you donrsquot, a bumptious bore will tell you why you should. But why does the kilt have to be associated with ldquorules and cultural snobbery  Better to do your own thing .Finally, therersquos one other thing we should talk about, and itrsquos an issue most men are reluctant to discuss: sex and gender. I was at a ceilidh a while ago and the subject of men dressing ldquoas women came up, with most of the guys saying they were uncomfortable with the idea. I pointed out they were expressing this opinion while wearing skirts, to which their response was ldquothese arenrsquot skirts, these are kilts!That says it all, doesnrsquot it  We live in a society that says certain clothes are for women and certain clothes are for men many men also believe skirts are ldquowrong and kilts are ldquoright.

Responding to an initial written question, a Minister would read out a turgid civil service response, then subside gratefully, hoping for a y supplementary to catch his breath.Up from the Labour side would bound Tam, to declare in his sonorous Etonian tones: ldquoHow much  Or, even better: ldquoWhy  Cue startled Minister.I thought of Tam when I pondered the question of a putative co-operation deal between the SNP Scottish Government and the Greens. Recalling my journalistic coaching, I asked: ldquoWho, what, when, where, why :Now Swinney has moved on, how will we sort out Scotlandrsquos struggling schools We know who: two parties, of dferent stature, supporting independence with ying degrees of fervour.We know what: a co-operation agreement short of full coalition. Eventually, there might be Green Ministers. For now, too soon.More to the point, the Greens stress they would reserve the right to dissent on certain specied issues. Which means no collective governmental responsibility. Which means no Ministers, for now.When  The talks are said to be at an early stage with months of discussion to come. Where  Holyrood.The big question, though, is why. One observer tells me that the Green co-leaders, Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater, seemed faintly taken aback at the initial ldquotalks about talks. Warily and sensibly, they stressed the need to consult colleagues.However, they have agreed to continue negotiating, noting en passant that they have secured concessions in recent Budget deals.There is history here. In , Alex Salmond led a minority administration. He tried to strike a partnership deal with the Liberal Democrats. That fell apart: key LibDems found the SNP and independence fundamentally unpalatable.Mr Salmond then turned to the Green MSPs. All two of them. The leader Robin Harper, with his permanent smile and Dr Who scarf. And Patrick Harvie, an astute politician even then.Again, a full partnership proved impossible, owing to a dispute over transport policy among other issues. A compact was signed to support the election of Mr Salmond as First Minister.That was not really needed: subsequent history proved that the party with the most MSPs would, in practice, be permitted by Parliament to enter office.They said they had been sold short. Mr Swinney was, to put it mildly, less than pleased. That memory no doubt lingers in the mind of the Deputy First Minister as he contemplates the new round of talks.So, again, why  Especially now, when the SNP are just one short of an overall majority in Holyrood.I sought answers from my Herald Podcast  among the number, Kezia Dugdale, who formerly led Labour and now heads the John Smith Centre. She disclosed that she had conducted extensive research, including a phone call to a pal in New Zealand, where there has been cross-party co-operation.She was advised that the Greens there felt they gained clout and influence. Labour leaders felt they gained extra security, including a pact which obviated the need for tense annual Budget talks.:Is independence inevitable or can unionists rescue the realm they cherish The deal has persisted, even though Labour won a majority last year. Some Greens are discontented.Scottish Green sources point to the New Zealand model, stressing the capacity to criticise the administration. They are less enthusiastic about the example of Ireland where some Greens fear their ideology risks being swamped in a compact with centre-right parties.Either way, it is, partly, about money. Nicola Sturgeon and Kate Forbes want to pre-empt the annual agony of Budgetary negotiations by securing potential support in advance.Not an easy sell. SNP Ministers are adamant they will stick to an income tax freeze for the duration of this Parliament. Greens favour a more radical approach to revenue, as they would see it, including a possible wealth taxa way could be found.But compromise could be reached. There will be other obstacles, such as Green opposition to road building. The FM said this week that dualling the A, for example, will not be halted.Then there is the North Sea. The parties dfer over the pace of shting away from oil and gas. With the COP  UN climate conference due in Glasgow, the SNP may be ready to give yet more ground, while protecting north-east jobs.Always, of course, there is independence. Would a compact add more impetus to the case for indyref  Not, I suspect, in terms of influencing the UK Government. But it would perhaps be a reminder of the ersity of support for independence.There is, however, a third motivation, beyond cash and indyref. The SNP have been in power for  years. The previous Holyrood session had a toxic tang: Brexit independence arguments and Nicola Sturgeon gazing fretfully over her shoulder at her ever-present predecessor.I believe the FM wants a fresh approach. Literally, a new politics. Sceptics will say this is purely about presentation. I think it is also strategic. By making a choice, by making a new alliance, Ms Sturgeon hopes to banish staleness from her own party, and simultaneously challenge rivals to refresh.She hopes, in so doing, to isolate the Tories. They respond by warning that the Greens will push her in an anti-business direction.She hopes, also, to challenge Labour, over policy and indyref. Anas Sarwar was, understandably, ill-prepared. His first response was simply to revive an old Labour theme, deriding the recreation of a spending cuts coalition.He will need a new tone, new phrases.

She also stated that about , care home deaths in England were not put down to Covid, but clearly were.To date, there is no evidence that hospital discharges led to a spike in care home deaths as opposed to transmission by asymptomatic agency staff and the failure to isolate residents who had caught the virus. Also, the size of the care home was more of an indicator of outbreak risk than hospital discharges, which were ultimately decisions taken by clinicians and home care managers in the best interest of patients.Mary Thomas, Edinburgh.THE ART OF DEFLECTIONTHERE seems to be little that anyone can teach Nicola Sturgeon in the art of deflective politics at a time when her Government is under fire for failures in the notication of Covid appointments and lacking candour over the deaths of children in hospital.As always Boris Johnson is an easy target and while her allegations that he dithered at the start of the pandemic leading to the unnecessary loss of lives may have some merit , she seems to forget that her own Government sanctioned the quick release of untested and infected elderly Covid patients from hospitals into care homes, resulting in a massive number of deaths.

If Anas Sarwar could bring himself to face reality rather than using the excuse of Covid recovery to justy fence-sitting on the independence issue he, and Mr Brown, might be pleasantly surprised at the public response.Willie Maclean, Milngavie.ROYALTY SHOULD STAY OUT OF POLITICSTHE recent foray of the Earl of Strathearn into the murky and emotional waters of constitutional politics north of the Border raises some very intriguing points.First, who is advising William at the moment  One would be forgiven for thinking that, following the Queenrsquos untimely intervention during the referendum on independence, his minders themselves would have intervened to stop it instead of clearly facilitating a leak.This was the beginning of a dark charm offensive by the unionists in advance of a possible second referendum. Such a referendum clearly has the air of inevitability about it, given Gordon Brown has come out of hibernation in his search for political relevancy. But theres also a very intriguing point here.As I understand it, and as we are frequently informed, the House of Windsor is supposed to stay out of partisan politics. That should have been enough reason to put the mockers on William and Gordonrsquos tecircte-agrave-tecircte. One could therefore ask with good reason: ldquoWell what about the unelected second chamber  Like the monarchy it is unelected with members being there either by accident of birth, religious affiliation or by being appointed by the will of politicians. I contend that neither the monarchy and those who represent that institution nor an unelected second chamber should be in a position to intervene in the running of the country.Rev John Nugent, Wick.OIL COMPANIES SHOULD HIT BACKA NETHERLANDS court has ruled that Shell must drastically cut its CO emissions by  . Other European countries are considering following suit.The worlds oil and gas companies should immediately declare that they will suspend all sales of oil and gas to any country that does likewise, then those countries will achieve net zero even quicker than they thought. Ill leave it to the reader to imagine the consequences.Geoff Moore, Alness.THIS WAS TORTURE, NOT OPERAI SHOULD be surprisedreader Tina Oakes , who professes disdain for English opera, dislikes the th century operas of Henry Purcell, especially Dido and Aeneas.The paying public in London and Dublin preferred oratorio to opera when Handel moved from Italy, where he had written exquisite Italian opera. The theme tune of the prosperous classes was Handelrsquos Messiah for the next three centuries.In Italy meanwhile, opera is the passion of humble and exalted folk alike from those days to these, with crowds in the street singing Verdirsquos Va, pensiero at his funeral.Ms Oakes is right about Gilbert and Sullivan. It is torture, not opera. But it was written as music hall with a dash of satire.There are even people who think Broadway musicals are opera, but that is not so.The th century wasnrsquot kind to serious music, especially not in English-speaking countries. Everyone had to pretend they liked academic work with no tunes, even when it was meant to be opera. James MacMillan I can tolerate, Harrison Birtwistle a bit, Britten not at all.Tim Cox, Bern, Switzerland.PAISLEYS LOST PARADISETHE Remember When... contribution by Russell Leadbetter concerning Sugar Ray Robinson in an exhibition boxing bout in Paisley in brought back many memories for me of the exciting times to be had at Paisley Ice Rink, alas no more.I remember the busy nights in the east end of Paisley as crowds made their way to see the ice hockey involving the Paisley Pirates. The Ice Rink, which could cope with , spectators, provided accommodation for many other attractions, such as exhibition tennis matches with players such as Rod Laver and Lew Hoad, and in  Muhammed Ali, billed as Cassius Clay, the world heavyweight champion, also appeared in an exhibition match. And not to be overlooked are the Humpty Dumpty and Cinderella pantomimes.All that is behind us now, but those were the days.Ian W Thomson, Lenzie.SHOOT, WHICH IS IT R RUSSELL Smithwill be aware of Lynne Trusss book \"The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation\" and its sub-title \"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\".Or should that be \"Eats Shoots and Leaves\" David Miller, Milngavie.Read more: Is there anyone brave enough to be Scotlands Dominic Cummings "},{"url":null,"title":"george-galloway-enters-by-election-race-scottish-parliament-defeat","story":"It comes after a failedbid to get elected to the Scottish Parliament in  election, placingsixth in the South Scotland region with just . per cent of the vote.The Scots veteran campaigner, who was expelled from Labour in , said he is standing as a candidate for his Workers Party of Britain in the poll on July .In a video posted on his social media feeds, filmed at Batley bus station, he said: ldquoIrsquom standing against Keir Starmer.ldquoIf Keir Starmer loses this by-election, itrsquos curtains for Keir Starmer.ldquoSo,for whatever reason you think that the current leader of the Labour Party needs to be replaced, Irsquom your man.I fought hard for #Brexit.

Whether youre a complete beginner, budding artist or have a wealth of experience, the charity, with the support of TEDxStormont and the world-renowned contemporary visual artist, Colin Davidson, is calling on artists of all ages to use their skills to illustrate a nature rich and climate safe future they want to see for Northern Ireland, as part of its Revive Our World campaign. Building on the idea of activist art, a term used to describe art that is grounded in the act of ‘doing’ to address political or social issues, the competition aims to give a  to a range of voices showing those in power why they should address the nature and climate emergency before it’s too late. The winners will not only be crowned Artist of the Year but the artwork will be centre stage at TEDxStormont Countdown in November to coincide with the th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties . Colin Davidson, who is one of the judges for the competition, said: “Art can capture and communicate a uniquely personal experience. Portraying the spirit and emotion of a subject is what drives me in my work. Art can offer the viewer a door into another way of looking at our world, and that’s why “I’m looking forward to seeing the entries for this year’s competition, to see what excites people about the future of Northern Ireland.” Sara McCracken, RSPB NI’s Head of Fundraising and Communications commented, “Throughout history some of the biggest changes have been brought about by a small group of passionate people, from civil rights to votes for women, including the start of the RSPB itself. “Over the years, artists have explored and documented history and politics to huge effect, the nature and climate emergency is the defining issue of our time, this is your chance to have your say and canvas for nature.” Curator of TEDxStormont, Eva Grosman, added, “At TEDx we passionately believe in the power of ideas to inspire, change attitudes, lives and ultimately the world. “The Countdown initiative is the perfect opportunity for Northern Ireland’s climate change experts and environmental leaders to discuss ideas for change. The nature and climate emergency effects everyone, and through this competition we want to shine a spotlight on the voices of the public who want to see a change in how we treat our natural world.” There are no restrictions on the type of artwork, it can be anything from photography and painting to ceramics or even crochet.

These have included its County Antrim congregations in its Route, Ballymena, Carrickfergus and Templepatrick presbyteries. Called ‘Fanning the flame’, the initiative is part of PCI’s Refined series of resources that it has developed throughout the pandemic to support and develop ongoing congregational le. Explaining the rationale for the series, Rev David Thompson, Secretary for the Council for Congregational Le and Witness , who organised the sessions, said that it was important for congregations to retain flexibility for the road ahead.“Since the start of the pandemic, it has been an extraordinarily dficult time for everyone. “For our congregations in Northern Ireland, it has been a very stop – start journey. “Thankfully it does feel like we are turning a corner and entering a moment of greater hope, optimism and opportunity, but it won’t be without its challenges.”The title for the series comes from  Timothy :-, which says, “For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gt of God [...] For the Spirit God gave us does not make us timid, but gives us power, love and self-discipline. Key leaders from each congregation in Northern Ireland, including those across County Antrim, were encouraged to participate.David Thompson said that he was pleased that each presbytery has responded positively to the Moderator’s invitation to be part of the programme. “Timing is key in building progress and trying to do so too early may lead to frustration. “Leaving it too late, may mean we miss an important moment. This is why we began with our northern presbyteries this month, with events for congregations in our southern presbyteries taking place in June, which seems about right given their setting and circumstances,” David Thompson said.Running the events has involved a signicant leap of faith and rapid learning by staff in how to harness the potential of digital technology and presentation. Lynne Herbison’ PCI’s Programme Development Officer added, “The team involved have learned a lot and those new skills will be invaluable in opening up a world of possibility in how we can now engage with congregations and their members in the future. “Nothing compares to being physically together, but we hope our digital  will be able to supplement that and improve the reach of what we can offer to our churches and their members.”Presbyterian Moderator, Right Reverend Dr David Bruce, who took part in the events, said, “This has been a massive undertaking, delivered in a very short window so as not to miss this crucial moment as we continue to turn this long awaited corner.“ I really want to commend everyone who has made this important series possible.“We have been through exceptionally challenging times and I don’t want to minimise that and the suffering that this pandemic has caused. In my contributions to each event, looking at how congregations can begin to move forward, I tried to convey a sense that change often forces reinvention and reconsideration, opening up new pathways and patterns that overlay the old familiar foundations of church le that we cherish. “Exploring this, I am looking forward to welcoming our Republic of Ireland presbyteries to ‘Fanning the Flame’ in June.” he said.Dr Bruce concluded by saying, “In the long history of God’s people there have been many times like the months we have experienced, and in those dark days God was at work, and He is today. “It is my earnest prayer that we will see tangible signs of His leading, so that we can press on with confidence into this new beginning.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1622208073289.jpg--covid_19___fri_28th_may_figures.jpg?1622208073000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20210528newscovid 19 fri 28th may figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows No further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Destinations include Portugal, Israel, Iceland, Australia and New Zealand.However, today’s poll reveals many are still deeply reluctant to hop on a plane abroad any time soon.People were asked, once vaccinated, when they would consider a foreign holiday.Just % said they plan to head away in  — % may travel this summer while another % would consider an overseas trip later in the year.The vast majority , said it would be next year before they think about going abroad.Another % said it would be two or three years before a trip outside the UK or Ireland, while % have no plans to go overseas at any point.The remaining % were unsure or had no firm opinion.Fewer older people are willing to consider overseas travel this year. Just % would consider doing so — % this summer and % at any point this year. More than halfsaid it would be next year before they consider jetting off, while % would leave it two or three years.By contrast, almost halfof  to  year olds are considering heading overseas this year — with % hoping to get away in the next few months and % later in the year. Another % will leave it to . Broken down by gender, males of any age are more willing to take a trip abroad — % plan to do so this summer and a further % will at some point in . Another % said it would be next year.However, just over a quarter of females plan to holiday abroad in  — % this summer and % this year. Some % plan to leave trips to .It comes as a public health expert from Belfast warned against summer holidays — despite the traffic light system for foreign travel.Professor Gabriel Scally told holidaymakers to “beware” and also warned it is “irresponsible” to travel to other countries while potentially infected with a dangerous iant.Prof Scally, a member of independent Sage, said: “The regional director of the World Health Organization in Europe issued a statement in the last couple of days saying there shouldn’t be international travel and I would agree with that.“It is undesirable to have people holidaying in international resorts at this time for all sorts of reasons.“It isn’t necessarily safe to travel on airplanes, there was a flight between India and Hong Kong and there were  infections and they were only picked up because of quarantine in Hong Kong.“Flights are dficult, but it isn’t just the flights, it’s what happens at arrivals and departures with queues of people in restricted spaces.“You also have lots of people from dferent countries mixing together at foreign resorts.“If you think back a year, the virus came to the UK and Republic of Ireland by people ing from holidays.”He continued: “It’s important to remember that the vaccine isn’t the cure all.“There’s always the risk posed by iants and it’s irresponsible to go off to another country and potentially take a dangerous iant with you.”Prof Scally also criticised the traffic light system, saying: “We need a proper managed quarantine system for everyone arriving into the country.”The Department of Health and the Executive were contacted for comment.Yesterday an airline industry chief said people who have received both doses of the Covid- vaccine should not face restrictions when travelling to countries on the Government’s amber list.Willie Walsh, director-general of airline body Iata, said people should be allowed to make up their own minds about the risks of travelling to amber list destinationsthey have received their jabs.Those ing from countries on the Government’s amber list must quarantine at home for  days and take pre-departure and post-arrival tests.But Mr Walsh, who is the former chief executive of IAG — the parent company of British Airways — said amber restrictions should be the same as those for green list countries for fully vaccinated passengers.He told the Mail on Sunday: “People were promised the benefit of being vaccinated — a vaccine idend — and they should be given it.“I thinkyou’ve had both shots then there’s no argument you can make to say those restrictions can remain in place, and people should be free to decide for themselvesthey see any risk in travelling to a green or amber country,” the former IAG chief executive added.Most ReadDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedFoster can leave at ‘time of her choosing’ says Poots as police confirm probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allIrish Government will #starve NI of medicine and food#: New DUP leader Edwin Poots hits outDUP leader Twitter handle snapped up by parody accountTop VideosPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths, fewer than  cases and vaccine programme extended£m to be paid out to NI businesses that managed to remain open during lockdownLatestBiden sets out plan for six trillion dollar budgetPep Guardiola and Thomas Tuchel prepared for penaltiesPiers Morgan hints at Good Morning Britain Army Of The Dead one of Netflix’s most streamed films ever, company saysTemporary export ban placed on £m roundel from th century,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurney PAAndrew MaddenTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people in Northern Ireland believe parents should have the right to refuse a Covid vaccine for their children, our poll shows.The news comes after Northern Ireland’s vaccine roll-out opened to those aged  to  and a raft of Covid restrictions are lted from Monday.“This has been made possible because of the success of the vaccination programme and the majority of people acting on the public health advice,” Health Minister Robin Swann said.According to the Belfast -LucidTalk poll, % of respondents felt parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should not and % said they did not know, were not sure or had no opinion.The figures, however, y depending on the age and religious make-up of those who took part in the poll.Regarding  to  year-olds, a majorityfelt parents should not be able to turn down a vaccine for their children, while % felt they should and % didn’t know or had no opinion.Those aged  to , on the other hand, had starkly contrasting views. Some % said parents should be able to refuse a vaccine for their children and % said they should not. And % said they didn’t know, were unsure or had no opinion.Vaccines may be refused for a iety of reasons. For instance, earlier this year several countries temporarily halted the roll-out of the AstraZeneca jab due to concerns of rare blood clots.Due to evidence suggesting that younger people may be at greater risk of the extremely rare clots associated with the AstaZeneca vaccine, those in this age group can choose which vaccine to receive.The latest advice states that anyone under  can book a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, or they can make what the Department of Health has described as an “informed decision” and get the AstraZeneca jab at Belfast’s SSE Arena or at participating community pharmacies.More than one million people in Northern Ireland have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine to date.Looking at the religious make-up of those who took part in the poll, it is apparent that Protestants are more likely to feel parents should have a say over vaccinating their children than when compared to Catholics.Some % of Protestant respondents felt this way, while % felt they should not have the right to turn down a jab for their children and % had no opinion, were not sure or didn’t know.Of those designating as Catholic, % felt they should have the right to turn down a vaccine for their children and % did not. The remaining % said they didn’t know or were unsure.In terms of those of no religion, % were in favour of parents having this right and % did not. Some % weren’t sure or had no opinion on the matter.On Sunday the Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride urged everyone to get vaccinated. He said: “A Public Health England study has found the vaccines are highly effective. This underlines the need for people to come forward for their first and second doses as soon as they are available.”Most ReadDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedFoster can leave at ‘time of her choosing’ says Poots as police confirm probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allIrish Government will #starve NI of medicine and food#: New DUP leader Edwin Poots hits outDUP leader Twitter handle snapped up by parody accountTop VideosPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPLatest CoronavirusMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Confirmed Covid cases in your area and seven day rolling averageCoronavirus QA: Everything you need to know as vaccination programme opens to all adultsNearly  payments issued under £k Covid grant scheme ineligibleCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No deaths, fewer than  cases and vaccine programme extended£m to be paid out to NI businesses that managed to remain open during lockdownLatestBiden sets out plan for six trillion dollar budgetPep Guardiola and Thomas Tuchel prepared for penaltiesPiers Morgan hints at Good Morning Britain Army Of The Dead one of Netflix’s most streamed films ever, company saysTemporary export ban placed on £m roundel from th century,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kevin Scott FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueHearing: TV presenter Dr Christian Jessen at a court appearance in BelfastRalph HewittTwitterEmailMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailArlene Foster has said she is “satisfied” with the outcome of a libel case taken against a celebrity doctor, saying his  social media claims “cut to the core” of her private le.Mrs Foster was speaking as it emerged Dr Christian Jessen has set up a GoFundMe page to help cover the £, in damages he was ordered to pay the former DUP leader after ly alleging on Twitter that she was having an extra-marital affair.She sued the Harley Street medic, best known for presenting Channel  shows Embarrassing Bodies and Supersize v Superskinny, over the tweet published to his , followers on December ,  and only taken down two weeks later.Within his GoFundMe page, set up on Monday, Dr Jessen said that he is considering appealing Thursday’s ruling and is raising the funds to help him fight “what is a most unfair situation”.Speaking to the Belfaston Friday, Mrs Foster said: I was glad and satisfied with the outcome.It was sad that I had to take that action but I felt very strongly about it. Obviously it cut to the core of my private le and I felt it needed to be called out.But we need to do more and perhaps I will use some of my time after I leave office to really be an advocate for people who otherwise wouldn#t be heard.It is simply unacceptable the amount of abuse that goes on online, especially young people.I#ve spent a lot of time speaking to young people recently and the amount of abuse that goes online.. and the fact that they can#t escape and the fact that it is leading them to mental health dficulties.So I want to explore how I do that, and challenge the anonymity of Twitter — the fact that you can set up an account and not be accountable for your views, I think is wrong.I believe in free speech, of course I do, but I think it does need to be regulated so that we don#t have that sort of harm going on at the moment.”Mr Justice McAlinden ruled in the High Court in Belfast on Thursday that Dr Jessen’s tweet was “grossly defamatory” when he awarded the record figure to the outgoing First Minister.Dr Jessen’s tweet involved baseless claims that the then DUP leader was in an adulterous relationship with one of her close protection officers.He shared the link to his GoFundMe page on Twitter on Friday, stating: “Dear all. I’m very grateful for your message of support and encouragement following the recent news. Would you please retweet and support me via my GoFundMe page  I have out more details there and I’ll keep you updated. Big hugs C x.”As of Friday afternoon, he raised £ of his £, target.Meanwhile, questions continue to mount over Twitter’s sanctions policies after Dr Jessen’s tweet was not removed, but the Belfast ’s Suzanne Breen’s account was blocked twice over a post about a Dublin crime boss.Elsewhere, Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford said he received “at least  racial slurs” on social media after his side’s loss to Villarreal in Wednesday’s Europa League final.Earlier this week Ms Breen, the Belfast ’s political editor, had her Twitter account blocked by the social media giant for the second time in just one month over a tweet about Daniel Kinahan.Her Twitter account was blocked at the beginning of May due to a tweet from February in relation to a BBC Panorama documentary on Kinahan. Twitter apologised and said enforcement was taken in error on both occasions.Kinahan , who is now based in Dubai, has no criminal convictions but has featured in investigations by the National Crime Agency and law enforcement organisations across Europe.Amnesty International’s Northern Ireland Director Patrick Corrigan said Twitter needs to do more to make it a safe place — particularly for women and people of colour, especially politicians and other public figures.“The persistent abuse people face on the  undermines their right to express themselves equally, freely and without fear,” he said. “Just as worrying are incidences of Twitter unnecessarily suspending accounts of journalists and media outlets due to complaints designed to curtail press freedom.”Mr Corrigan added that Amnesty International has outlined steps Twitter can take to make it safer — but the company has not yet implemented them.A Twitter spokesperson said the company enforces its rules judiciously and impartially for all accounts that engage in behaviours that violates rules in line with its range of enforcement options.“We condemn racism in all its forms and do not tolerate this behaviour on Twitter,” the spokesperson continued. “We use a combination of machine learning-based automation and human review to enforce our policies across the service and have permanently suspended a number of accounts for violating our hateful conduct policy.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedFoster can leave at ‘time of her choosing’ says Poots as police confirm probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allIrish Government will #starve NI of medicine and food#: New DUP leader Edwin Poots hits outDUP leader Twitter handle snapped up by parody accountTop VideosPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPLatest Northern IrelandGillian HallidayOpinionLooking like a metaphorical weight’s been lted off her shouldersSearch for common ground for the good of NI: Arlene’s words of wisdom to successorDerry crisis intervention service ‘must have permanent funding’‘Hope, excitement and relief’ as Ireland prepares for extensive reopeningPolice investigating claims of intimidation during DUP leadership contestLatestGillian HallidayOpinionLooking like a metaphorical weight’s been lted off her shouldersSearch for common ground for the good of NI: Arlene’s words of wisdom to successorBiden sets out plan for six trillion dollar budgetPep Guardiola and Thomas Tuchel prepared for penaltiesPiers Morgan hints at Good Morning Britain ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This party is always described as a bit of a family party and sometimes in your family you have a bit of a ding dong and there was probably a bit of a ding dong, but we#ll pull together, Mr Paisley said.East Antrim MP Sammy Wilson also denied there were isions within the party.People had an opportunity to say, they said it very forthrightly and it was all very amicable at the end of the day and a decision was made, he said.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePress Eye - Belfast - Northern Ireland - th May  Edwin Poots pictured at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Belfast where the ruling executive of the Democratic Unionist Party are meeting to raty Edwin Poots as the party’s new leader.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes   Press EyeMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailWhen Arlene Foster arrived in Ballygally, Co Antrim yesterday she displayed the care-free air that a schoolchild feels ahead of the  summer holidays beginning.The scenic coastal village – one of the stunning stops along the world-famous Causeway Coastal route – was the perfect end to what marked her last day as DUP leader.Ballygally was gearing up for an influx of Bank Holiday weekend visitors ice cream well stocked in the local shop, the main car park low on spaces. The sun peaking behind the clouds threatening rain, but thankfully staying dry for her visit.Smiling and the mood jovial, Mrs Foster was keen to chat away to William Thompson, chairman of Larne Athletic Club about its Larne Coast Road k run in July.Are you all set for the big run ” she asked.A question that could also be easily been directed at her successor, Edwin Poots who faces a big task healing isions after a turbulent week for the party.First the Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP group declared its loyalty to the outgoing leader, leading to the resignation of veteran member, Paul Bell.Then there was the accusation that loyalist intimidation was involved in the leadership contest itself, against Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s campaign team.Of course for the proud Fermanagh woman herself, she had closure to her libel action against TV medic, Dr Christian Jessen when a judge ordered the celebrity to pay £, in damages, plus costs for his unfounded and “outrageous libel”.Laughing when it remarked that she had had a “busy week”, Mrs Foster had the demeanor of someone who has had a metaphorical weight lted off their shoulders: relaxed and unburdened.She told the Belfastherself that she was “at peace” with the decision to step down as leader..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedFoster can leave at ‘time of her choosing’ says Poots as police confirm probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allIrish Government will #starve NI of medicine and food#: New DUP leader Edwin Poots hits outDUP leader Twitter handle snapped up by parody accountTop VideosPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPLatest Northern IrelandSearch for common ground for the good of NI: Arlene’s words of wisdom to successorArlene Foster ‘glad and satisfied’ with outcome of libel caseDerry crisis intervention service ‘must have permanent funding’‘Hope, excitement and relief’ as Ireland prepares for extensive reopeningPolice investigating claims of intimidation during DUP leadership contestLatestSearch for common ground for the good of NI: Arlene’s words of wisdom to successorBiden sets out plan for six trillion dollar budgetPep Guardiola and Thomas Tuchel prepared for penaltiesPiers Morgan hints at Good Morning Britain Army Of The Dead one of Netflix’s most streamed films ever, company says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Stock image FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNearly % believe that the churches and faith communities hold views that limit their ability to help those struggling with mental health and wellbeing. Stock imageAlf McCrearyEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailMore than half of people questioned for a report on mental health have claimed that the churches in Northern Ireland are not places of genuine welcome.Nearly % believe that the churches and faith communities hold views that limit their ability to help those struggling with mental health and wellbeing.However, all respondents felt that the churches did have an important role to play in promoting good mental health.Dr Andrew Cunning, director of the Christian organisation Left Side Up which produced its “Call to Action” report, said: Our publication is designed to challenge the church while equipping and supporting it to do even better in the areas of mental health and wellbeing. In it we spent time in looking at the Bible, the issue of welcome, toxic theologies and alternative spiritual practices.”Almost  people across Northern Ireland were surveyed, including Presbyterians, Anglicans, Baptists, Methodists, Catholics and members of the Vineyard Church.Three-quarters of these were women, % are leaders in the churches and faith communities, % are heterosexual and % are LGBT. Ages range from  to .Some % said they have been diagnosed with a mental health issue and % believe that they have an undiagnosed mental health issue or illness.Meanwhile, % believe mental health is connected to faith, while % have questioned their faith because of mental ill-health.Also in the survey, % of people believed that the churches need to encourage open conversation about mental health and wellbeing.Some iniduals believe that the churches have made a positive contribution. One said: “There are many within the church community who are kind, generous and good listeners.”Another said: People in my church community care for each other and try to support each other’s wellbeing.”Overall, however, % of the respondents in the survey say that they have experienced the Bible being used in a way that is damaging to mental health, and % “have found other spiritual practices outside of church that are helpful for their mental health and wellbeing.”The report lists some “toxic theology “ situations, including the claim that “suicide is a sin”, as well as “Medication and treatment are the opposite to faith” and “your faith is too weak, otherwise you would be well.”It also refers to “a lack of providing solutions that aren’t in the Bible. The belief that everything is in ’God’s hands’ and to simply ‘pray away’ a situation is unhelpful when your mental health and circumstances do not change, in spite of praying and reading the Bible.”The report recommends providing pastoral care to people who suffer from mental health issues and encouraging them to seek help..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedFoster can leave at ‘time of her choosing’ says Poots as police confirm probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allIrish Government will #starve NI of medicine and food#: New DUP leader Edwin Poots hits outDUP leader Twitter handle snapped up by parody accountTop VideosPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPLatest Northern IrelandSDLP chief calls for action over north west’s ‘crumbling homes’Rainbow crossing: Mayor finds the finance for Derry projectGillian HallidayOpinionLooking like a metaphorical weight’s been lted off her shouldersSearch for common ground for the good of NI: Arlene’s words of wisdom to successorArlene Foster ‘glad and satisfied’ with outcome of libel caseLatestSDLP chief calls for action over north west’s ‘crumbling homes’Rainbow crossing: Mayor finds the finance for Derry project‘No-shows’ add to restaurant owner’s woe‘Perfect storm’ blamed as bill for negligence is £m in six yearsGillian HallidayOpinionLooking like a metaphorical weight’s been lted off her shoulders,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Liam McBurneyKathy DonaghyMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailSDLP leader Colum Eastwood has called for urgent intervention to resolve the mica crisis across the north west.He said it was unacceptable that families have seen their homes “crumble around them”.As many as , houses across counties Donegal and Mayo have been falling apart because of mica, a mineral in the blocks which absorbs water. Mica causes buildings to disintegrate and plastering to crack.While the current scheme requires homeowners to pay for % of the repairs, campaigners want the Irish government to provide % redress for affected homeowners.Mr Eastwood, the MP for Foyle, said: “Tens of thousands of homeowners have been watching their homes crumble around them. Their lives and livelihoods have been damaged through no fault of their own. Most cannot afford to start again nor should they have to.These are heartbreaking testimonies of homeowners who worked all their lives so they could build their dream home to retire to, now left with few options. It is clear the current scheme of redress does not work to support all of those affected.“The Irish Government should intervene and change the current redress scheme so that % of costs are provided up front for repairs and that this applies across the board.”Among those affected are Pamela and Ciaran McLaughlin, whose home overlooks Trawbreaga Bay on the Inishowen Peninsula in Co Donegal.The house they built became a nightmare when it started to disintegrate over a decade ago.It was  when they first noticed something unusual about the exterior of the house: cracks were appearing, and Ciaran, a lorry driver, tried to cover them up before painting the place.They found out through word of mouth that a few other locals were noticing the same thing about their homes.Two years later, they got an engineer in to examine the problem and samples were sent away for testing. They had never heard of mica when the test results came back to show a high content of the mineral in the blocks.Pamela, a medical secretary at Altnagelvin Hospital in Londonderry, didn’t realise then that her home was disintegrating as time went on. Doors in the house wouldn’t close and the cracks got bigger.“We’d be sitting on the couch at night and I’d hear the cracks of the walls crumbling. I’d wake up in my bed after hearing cracks. In the last year, I’d had enough of the kids being scared at night,” Pamela said.“But we didn’t want to move out because where were we going to go to  The damp was creeping into the rooms, but my biggest concern was trying to hide it from the children.The family are now renting a house nearby. “It’s fine. The kids are happy, but it’s not long-term. We always want to come home and it’s not the same. The kids miss their rooms,” she said.Pamela says the ongoing stress of dealing with the house has put a huge strain on her family.Ciaran said families in the area have been out of pocket trying to fix their crumbling homes. He believes this legacy may mean children not having the future they deserve because their parents cannot afford it..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedFoster can leave at ‘time of her choosing’ says Poots as police confirm probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allIrish Government will #starve NI of medicine and food#: New DUP leader Edwin Poots hits outDUP leader Twitter handle snapped up by parody accountTop VideosPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPLatest Northern IrelandNorthern Ireland churches are not welcoming, say half of survey respondentsRainbow crossing: Mayor finds the finance for Derry projectGillian HallidayOpinionLooking like a metaphorical weight’s been lted off her shouldersSearch for common ground for the good of NI: Arlene’s words of wisdom to successorArlene Foster ‘glad and satisfied’ with outcome of libel caseLatestNorthern Ireland churches are not welcoming, say half of survey respondentsRainbow crossing: Mayor finds the finance for Derry project‘No-shows’ add to restaurant owner’s woe‘Perfect storm’ blamed as bill for negligence is £m in six yearsGillian HallidayOpinionLooking like a metaphorical weight’s been lted off her shoulders,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kelvin Boyes   Press EyeGillian HallidayTwitterEmailMay   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailNorthern Ireland’s next First Minister must aim to find the “common ground” in the power-sharing Executive, Arlene Foster has said.Mrs Foster offered words of advice to her successor on what was her last day as DUP leader yesterday.On her last official engagement of the day in Ballygally, Co Antrim, where she met with representatives of Larne Athletic Club, she said she hoped her successor was aware of the role’s demands.Paul Givan has been linked to the top job, with the other contender Mervyn Storey reportedly turning down the job.Mrs Foster told the Belfastthat whoever takes over faces a big task.“I would say to them... that it is a hugely rewarding job but a hugely challenging job,” she said. “And there’s a lot of searching for common ground when you’re First Minister because of course we’re in a five-party coalition. It isn’t a single party government and therefore there is that very great demand of trying to find the common ground for the good of everybody in Northern Ireland.“And I hope whoever is put in as First Minister, they recognise that it is absolutely a challenge but rewarding as well when what you’re doing is right for the people of Northern Ireland.”Earlier, she revealed during a visit to Banbridge Academy in Co Down that while she was set to remain First Minister until the end of June, she would leave earlynew DUP leader Edwin Poots removes her allies from office next week.Mr Poots could name a new set of ministers as early as Tuesday.Mrs Foster added: “I will resign as well because I have my ministerial team in the Executive with me, we have worked very closely together.“If Edwin decides that he wants to change that team, I will have to go as well because I can’t stay with a new ministerial team of which I have no authority, and that would be wrong.”She was, however, gracious in offering her well-wishes to Mr Poots, amid deepening isions within the DUP following accusations loyalist paramilitary intimidation tactics had been used against members of Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s leadership campaign.“I’ve come to terms with the fact that I’m stepping down as leader, some weeks ago now,” she explained.“I’m wishing him well for the future. Obviously it’s time for me to move on and do dferent things. I’m not sure yet what that’ll be, but we’ll find out soon enough.”Asked by pupils at Banbridge Academyshe would recommend a career in politics, Mrs Foster said: Yes I would, without hesitation.Despite all the challenges, it is a hugely rewarding career. As well as representing my constituency, I have been able to represent Northern Ireland.That has been the greatest privilege of my le. To go to places and sell Northern Ireland as a place to invest in and a place to visit is a tremendous privilege.Mr Poots said he had no intention of forcing Mrs Foster out of office and she could remain until a time of her choosing.“That’s my position and that remains my position. I am not going to be rushed into doing anything or pushed into doing anything, nor am I going to be denied doing something that I am ready to do,” Mr Poots said.“We will look at all of these issues and take a decision at a time that is appropriate for us.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Most ReadDUP turmoil: Resignations, walk outs and heated exchanges after #ding dong# leadership meeting but Poots insists party not idedFoster can leave at ‘time of her choosing’ says Poots as police confirm probe into bullying and UDA intimidation claimsMajestic Hillsborough mansion has it allIrish Government will #starve NI of medicine and food#: New DUP leader Edwin Poots hits outDUP leader Twitter handle snapped up by parody accountTop VideosPlayDUP turmoil: Poots insists party isn#t idedPlayArlene Foster says election intimidation from UDA #quite shocking#PlayEdwin Poots full speech as he is ratied new leader of the DUPLatest Northern IrelandArlene Foster ‘glad and satisfied’ with outcome of libel caseDerry crisis intervention service ‘must have permanent funding’‘Hope, excitement and relief’ as Ireland prepares for extensive reopeningPolice investigating claims of intimidation during DUP leadership contestRepresenting Northern Ireland ‘greatest privilege of my le’ – Arlene FosterLatestBiden sets out plan for six trillion dollar budgetPep Guardiola and Thomas Tuchel prepared for penaltiesPiers Morgan hints at Good Morning Britain Army Of The Dead one of Netflix’s most streamed films ever, company saysTemporary export ban placed on £m roundel from th century,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

He’s got the initial experience under his belt, and we will give him as much support as we can to allow him to excel. The competition will be strong, but Callum is a very determined and talented young driver with the potential to surprise a few people this year.” Motorsport Ireland Rally Academy driver Devine will be joined for his ERC adventure by co-driver James Fulton and the Championship will consist of eight rounds taking place in Poland, Latvia, Italy, the Czech Republic, the Azores, Portugal, Hungary and Gran Canarias.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He waves a cursory greeting and continues on his way. In the time it takes me to gather everything I need together, he passes me again, his step count no doubt rising with every lap of the town. Zoom. Walk. Laptop. Bake. Netflix. Repetition has become endemic over the last year, but its something Moneymore cant be accused of. There is a unique feel to the fronts of the buildings that greet me as I walk around the town. Even the post office, now boarded up, remains unbranded. googletag.cmd.push Moneymores terrain gives the town a layered effect. The pillared entrance of The Manor House provides the backdrop to the towns mini roundabout, welcoming motorists coming down the hill from Smith Street. Rusty scaffolding frames a construction site on my left as I make my way down. A woman waters potted plants in her compact front garden. The distinctive smell of curry is emanating from the two Chinese restaurants at the bottom of the hill. Shutters are down on Antonios pizza, yet to open for the day. More scaffolding sits alongside buildings in mid-construction off High Street, but no work appears to be going on today. googletag.cmd.push Along Lawford Street there are ersion signs in place as Council staff busy themselves in resurfacing the Turnaface Road. The grating sound of the road roller echoes off the houses that line the street leading back to the town centre. You could describe Moneymore as ornate. Older, unique buildings, set at dferent levels, create a layered backdrop, crowned by the spire of St John and St Treas church on the top of the hill.  The hum of a small aircraft passing overhead and the unmistakable smell of freshly-cut grass adds to the sense of a town taking new-found pleasure in the mundane.     A pregnant sky threatens rain. Taken a dip I nip into The Mane Barber Shop, where a neon sign declares the shop open for business. Owner Pauline McGarvey is at her lunch. She says reopening has not been the silver bullet the industry was hoping for. “This week has been terrible. For the first seven days [after reopening] it was great, but its taken a dip again,” she tells me. “The older folk that keep you going – your pensioners and farmers and that during the day – they havent been about the same. A vintage tractor model welcomes visitors to the town from the Tyrone side. “It was a gamble coming into a small town. You do have a bit of passing trade but youre hoping people are going to come in from the likes of Coagh, Lissan and Loup. “I said I would give it six months and see how it turns. Its fine, but its not busy. You have that fear of whether its going to come back.” Pauline has been in Moneymore three years, and until the pandemic ruthlessly attacked all businesses, things had been going well.  has seen a seismic change across all industries, driving many hair and beauty professionals off the high street altogether. “Lots of people are working from home and I have to admit, Im tempted,” she says. “Youre still going to be hit with rates, and you havent stopped paying your water bill, your electricity, your rent. “Yes, we got a bit of help, butyouve no customers in, then that money is all going to go and you still have to find wages too. “Ive seen a lot of hair and beauty people who havent gone back from the first lockdown.” Humanity adapts though, and over the last year, Pauline has embraced the situation in which the world found itself. She got married in February, and has enjoyed the extra time with her family. Keeping an eye on litter in the area. “It was the first time in my le I could actually say I was a mummy. I loved spending time with the weans,” she says. “It felt like wed a whole  years wrapped into one year. It is nice getting back though, you need the routine. Its bittersweet in a way.” Cookstown native Pauline says lockdown has really hit young people in the area hard. Her daughter, Danielle, is in Year , her entire GCSE years undertaken amid a worldwide health crisis. “Even she says she could do with another year at school,” she says. “Theyve missed a full year of preparation for the next step. Theyve been living alone in their bedroom. No formal, nothing. They werent even in school to plan it.” Its a quiet day in the barber shop, on what would normally be a busy Friday afternoon, with people popping in ahead of their weekend plans. There would have been excited chatter, the buzz of anticipation. Last minute changes of plan. Maybe even a wee drink. A look at her schedule confirms a gap of a few hours until Paulines next appointment. Without that steady flow of customers, the day can be long, lonely even. Welcome to Moneymore. Company is a two way street, and the dynamic of conversation, service and industry has been greatly missed by both barber and customer. “Even the most bald man that I have is in here every week,” says Pauline. “Two seconds would do it, but you would stretch it out to ten or  minutes, just because he likes coming in for the company. “Sometimes its just nice to get sitting down and get it done for you. Even though I have good faithful customers, I was nervous and jittery the first day back. “The amount of people who are saying its great to see you back, it gives you that wee glow. It would be nice to see a boom in Moneymore again. “I dont think anybody is going to feel anything dferent. Were all just going with the flow and trying not to stress and worry. “I think youre just going to have to wipe this year out the same as last year.”  The indicators that marked the early, panic-stricken days of the pandemic – the empty streets, closed schools, empty supermarket shelves – have long faded into memory. Only the window dressing remains. Sanitisers at shop doors. Face masks in shops. The odd discarded rubber glove on the street. All three car dealerships on the Magherafelt Road are dotted with customers as I drive past on the way home. The petrol station forecourt is hiving with people. By next Monday, theof indoor hospitality will mark another signicant step on the road to recovery. On the way out of the town, I spot a familiar cowboy hat bobbing up and down at the road side. A man enjoying his rediscovered freedom on the fringes of the Sperrins.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Just over a year before his tragic and untimely death, Karl dragged Ballinascreen to the  title, overturning their U final defeat at the hands of Banagher two years earlier. The restructuring of the age grades, away from U, means the rescheduled  meeting of Lavey and Dungiven will be the last time a trophy will be presented in Karls honour. Fittingly, Fridays showdown will be played at Ballinascreen, but his legacy wont end there. A banner placed prominently along the new walking track at Dean McGlinchey Park will keep his memory burning brightly. googletag.cmd.push Either side of Karls photo are images of his Ballinascreen jerseys, football and hurling. His hurl and boots, as well as his distinctive helmet are also pictured. The generations that follow, those too young to remember his performances in the maroon and white, will be forever reminded of Karl. The banner to be erected at Dean McGlinchey Park. He epitomised sport. His jovial character made a team more than about training and games. On the flip-side, youd want him in your corner when the chips were down. Step back in time. With seven minutes of the  U final remaining, Gavin ONeills penalty levelled matters and it was time for someone to stand up and be counted. Ballinascreen had that somebody. His name was Karl McAuley. googletag.cmd.push After powering upfield, he laid the ball off to Carlus McWilliams and one pass later Dean Flanagan slotted the ball beyond goalkeeper Daryl McDermott for the game-defining goal. Ballinascreen captain on the day was Karls best friend Alastair Clerkin. They grew up a mile apart, were in the same class at the nearby Straw Primary School and soldiered together on the same football teams. Ironically Alastairs son was born on the anniversary of Karls death. Alastair would place flowers on Karls grave and is still a close friend of the family. Shortly after Karls death, Alastairs mother Bernie left a statue at the grave of two warriors battling for a high ball, which inspired the design of the model handed out to the dozen who followed in Karls footsteps as Man of the Match.     It helped Karls spirit stand the test of time. The Mid-Ulster Observers report described his  final midfield performance as a Tour de Force. The year after Karls death, Derry minors first trial was at Ballinascreen where had been tipped to play a starring role and nail down a place on the . There was an impeccable minute silence in the clubs hall before an army of nervous and excited trialists embarked on a morning of football. But for that minute, there wasnt a sound. And there will be a lump in every Ballinascreen throat on Friday night when the final U Man of the Match follows in Karls footsteps. He played around the middle for Ballinascreen teams, somewhere he could shape a game from. Those who knew him best, coached him and played alongside him tipped him for a long career. “Karl was brilliant that day,” Clerkin recalls of his box to box U final performance. “He was just everywhere and making things happen...he covered every blade of grass. “He wouldve been very consistent, but in that game, he was on a dferent level by his own standards. It was one of those games when he stood up and dragged the team with him.” It was fitting that Karls spadework made the dference, in the pressure cooker of the closing stages. Clerkin paid him the highest compliment, calling him a big game player. A championship man. Martin Boyle, who coached that U team with Mickey ONeill and Jerome Bradley, said how Karl, in his finest hour, simply dragged his side to victory by refusing to accept a defeat that was staring them in the face. The Mid Ulster Observer match report from the  U Final. Outside of the white heat of battle, Karl didnt take himself too serious. At training, many wouldve been on the receiving end of his jokes. Then, asflicking a switch, hed put his game face on and deliver by the bucketful, when it mattered. “He was there primarily for the craic and to enjoy himself and he was quite good at football as it happened,” Clerkin adds. “Hed still be playing with all the lads he grew up with...you miss the craic you wouldve had with him.” Martin Boyle was in no doubt hed have blossomed into a mainstay of the clubs senior team. The Kilrea team, led by James Kielt, who went through their entire club underage careers unbeaten overcame Ballinascreen in the  Feacuteile final. “He was our best player that day at corner back and he was a year young,” Boyle remembers. Boyle is now the Derry minor manager, a team that includes Matthew Downey and Dan Higgins, the last two winners of the U final Man of the Match. “I told them just how special an award it is as Karl was such a special person and sportsman.” Like Clerkin, Boyle echoed Karls off the pitch qualities. “Karl made a lasting impression on everyone fortunate enough to come into contact with him,” Boyle said. “In a team environment he was a dream, brilliant for morale and craic among lads.” At school, he played on St Colms U Derry championship winning team of , their first in many years. When asked for a memory of Karl McAuley, their coach Ciaran Meenagh looked back on their Ulster clash with St Pauls Bessbrook. St Colms were leading by two points, as the game ticked into the last  minutes in a foggy winter afternoon. After an off the ball incident, the game  boiled over. Meenagh points to it as a scary moment for a typical  year-old. But not Karl, who won the hop ball, kicked two late points and alongside Anton Kelly, the pair stemmed the tide. “It was just indicative of his character and his backbone,” Meenagh states. “He was tough and had a savage temperament...he would have gone far...I’m sure of that. “He was just a super lad altogether, what a character. He had a brilliant heart on the field of play.” The McAuley family will feel Karls loss more than anyone. Theyll miss him every day. But, tucked amongst those emotions, they can take strength from how he rubbed off o others. Those who competed with and against him on the playing fields of Derry and beyond held him in the highest regard. Its fitting the last piece of the history from the Derry U football championship will be the presentation of Karls award, the final Tour de Force. Thats his legacy. He will never be forgotten.

Parks Rio Grande, the Faughan River, flows through the centre of the village, which this afternoon sits under an angry-looking sky. A woman walks her dog down Learmount Road, her face set against the stf breeze that is swishing through the trees surrounding the village. The scene on Learmount Road leading up the hill.

A delivery driver pulls into the yard of Devine Kitchens. He s to his cab and pulls out a hammer. Things must be getting serious. As I cross the bridge, I spot the wheel from an old watermill by the river side, almost reclaimed by its surroundings. A remnant of an  flax mill known as Quigleys Mill. googletag.cmd.push Perhaps the most clear view of the mill is from the top of the hill outside Park Hardware and DIY. Greg McElhinney and Matthew Devine. Inside, owner Greg McElhinney says the last year has been busy. “With construction and everything  closing down last April, we were very busy, which was good for us because people from the local area were able to do home projects,” he tells me. “The weather was good as well, so youd a lot of painting and decorating – fences and gardens and stuff like that – going on. “People were happy there was a local business still operating, because a lot of the bigger hardware stores had closed.     “It got to the stage when it was hard to source materials because suppliers were closed until June time, but people were happy enough to occupy their time. They had nothing  to do.” The remains of Quigleys Mill, Park. Parks postal area recorded an increase in Covid cases last week, and despite the attachment to Derry city skewing the numbers, Greg admits there is still a degree of worry locally. “The majority of the population feel we still have to be serious about this. Its drilled into everybody at this stage, like putting your seatbelt on in the car,” he says. “The worry now is were straddling the Donegal border to a certain extent and case numbers are very high either side of it. “There is more positivity now than there was maybe six weeks ago though. Society is opening up again, and the vaccinations are a positive thing.” Covid has taken its toll on rural le too, and compliance with regulations has come at a social cost for village communities. “Where were based is very much a rural area, with a lot of the farming community and tradesmen and stuff,” says Greg. “You get some people who, by chance, meet up outside the shop here and have an opportunity to have a chat that maybe havent seen each other in a few months. “Those guys would have been at markets or farm meets every week, or pubs, but now you see them sitting out there for half an hour chatting to each other. “The social aspect, face to face, is the biggest thing. “The local community group have done a lot of work with the walkways there over the past number of years, which is very good.” Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty from Learmount Community Development Group. The local community group to which Greg refers is Learmount Community Development Group, which is nestled down a lane next to the entrance to Learmount Forest. Over the last year, Caroline Lynch and Catriona Doughty have noticed a big increase in people using Parks hidden gem. “We would have come down here some mornings and that car park would be full,” says Caroline. “Our secret Learmount Forest isnt a secret any more, and thats great, because everybody wants out, and weve had drop-ins coming from that.” “The forest has been fantastic for people being able to get out and safely meet their neighbours,” adds Catriona. “Theyll maybe call in at quiet times to have a socially distanced cup of tea. That social aspect has been missed, they are missing company and casual conversation.” Caroline feels the experience of the last year has sharpened focus on the issue of loneliness that had been hiding in plain sight. “We had a man who lives alone and had been sick for two or three days,” she says. “He hadnt been out and had no food in the house, so thankfully we were able to help with that. “You just know people are lonely and looking to get out again, but at the same time are a bit anxious about it. “Theyre happy to take the summer out of it and see what happens. There is certainly a lot of loneliness, isolation and depression though. “You could obviously be in the middle of a housing site and still be lonely, but when you see some of the people on their own, up a lane, they see nobody. They barely even see the postman now.” Working with both young and old people, the group have seen the effect the pandemic and its associated lockdowns have had on both generations.  “A lot of our work is with older people, and whilst theyre saying theyre fed up, some of them are getting a wee bit set in their ways,” says Caroline. “You just know by talking to them. We had a woman who always came in every week, even when it was bad, and she hasnt been in about two months. “Its highlighted how much we miss the social side of things, not being able to get out and meet friends. Even for the youth. “People always think all they need is their phone, because thats all theyre sitting on, but you can see now how the youth are crying out as much for social contact as any other generation.” There is hope though, that with the vaccines roll out and the upcoming warmer weather, that the group will be able to run some of their usual summer events. “We are looking at putting together a summer programme, but wed be a bit nervous ourselves about bringing a group of people into the room,” says Caroline.  “It would be perfectthere was good weather, because it will be planned outdoors. If the weather is bad, well take it over to Park hall, because its a bit bigger than here. “We have funding for dancing and music, which I think people would love to hear. Wed love to have tables out there on a nice evening, with a bit of a barbecue and a bit of music. “Youd like to think by September, we should be able to get going.” On the way back through the village, the shutters are half up on the Rio Grande as preparations continue inside. By the time you read this it will have reopened its doors. Hospitality has ed throughout the county, another step on the road to recovery. The farmers outside Greg McElhinneys store now have somewhere  to shoot the breeze. For the next few weeks at least, Covid fears will be drowned out by clink of glasses, the audible relief of the repressed socialite and the laughter of friends reunited. Dancing, however, is still prohibited under the regulations. It may need to be done across Parks Rio Grande, rather than inside it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Filming on The School for Good and Evil is currently continuing in Belfast. However, SDLP councillor Shauna Cusack said Derry had also been considered as a filming base for the movie. Cllr Cusack revealed details of Derrys bid as she put forward a motion at the monthly meeting yesterday of Derry City and Strabane District which called for more to be done to promote the local council region as a destination for the film and broadcast industry. Starring Charlize Theron, Laurence Fishburne and Kerry Washington, The School for Good and Evil is based on a best-selling series of young adult fantasy novels. googletag.cmd.push It is currently being filmed atBelfast Harbour Studios. It is understood the production crew will be in Northern Ireland for at least  weeks and Northern Ireland Screen estimates that it will generate investment of approximately poundm with around  crew working on the film. Speaking at yesterdays meeting, Cllr Cusack said Derry came very close to securing part of the films production. “Regrettably for a number of reasons we lost out to Belfast which as we all know is currently the go-to hub for productions that decide to come here. “Belfast is going from strength to strength and the city is currently hosting two major productions for both Netflix and Paramount along with several other high profile BBC dramas and they are employing over , crew. googletag.cmd.push “I feel that we need to improve our ambition and profile in this sector in order to compete for business. As opposed to waiting for opportunities, to actively seek them. “With the industry booming in both Ireland and the UK, many cities are seeing the benefits of being shovel-ready for companies. “Most cities and councils on these islands have already developed their own film departments to showcase their own locations. We have not.” Cllr Cusack said the success of Derry Girls in particular had shown Derrys potential as a location for TV and film production but added that the council had to be serious about building on that success.     She also asked that the council do more to support and promote young local broadcasting talent. “As a council we need to be moving forward with the times, trends and technology. Film and broadcast is an intrinsic part of every day le now and council need to embrace that. “Ultimately, we want jobs and long-term opportunities to improve lives and the economy here. “Finally, and to steal a line from a famous movie, I firmly believe thatwe build it they will come.” Cllr Cusacks motion was supported by all other parties on the council. Sinn Fein councillor Conor Heaney said the film and TV industry had great potential. “I think it definitely should be a focus for the Business and Culture committee of this council,” he said. The motion was also supported by DUP Alderman Keith Kerrigan who highlighted the impact that the filming of Game of Thrones in Northern Ireland had on the tourism industry. However, Alderman Kerrigan said it was important that the entire council region was marketed and not just the city. People Before Profit councillor Maeve ONeill praised the trailblazers in Derry who had worked in the TV and film industry for many years. She said some of these old hands could be used as part of efforts to develop the local potential. Alliance councillor Rachael Ferguson also highlighted the potential for local colleges to get involved in the initiative. Ulster Unionist councillor Derek Hussey said the motion was a no brainer and he was fully in support of it. Alderman Hussey said he could not understand why a film had never been made about the  Siege of Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Filming on The School for Good and Evil is currently continuing in Belfast. However, SDLP councillor Shauna Cusack said Derry had also been considered as a filming base for the movie. Cllr Cusack revealed details of Derrys bid as she put forward a motion at the monthly meeting yesterday of Derry City and Strabane District which called for more to be done to promote the local council region as a destination for the film and broadcast industry. Starring Charlize Theron, Laurence Fishburne and Kerry Washington, The School for Good and Evil is based on a best-selling series of young adult fantasy novels. googletag.cmd.push It is currently being filmed atBelfast Harbour Studios. It is understood the production crew will be in Northern Ireland for at least  weeks and Northern Ireland Screen estimates that it will generate investment of approximately poundm with around  crew working on the film. Speaking at yesterdays meeting, Cllr Cusack said Derry came very close to securing part of the films production. “Regrettably for a number of reasons we lost out to Belfast which as we all know is currently the go-to hub for productions that decide to come here. “Belfast is going from strength to strength and the city is currently hosting two major productions for both Netflix and Paramount along with several other high profile BBC dramas and they are employing over , crew. googletag.cmd.push “I feel that we need to improve our ambition and profile in this sector in order to compete for business. As opposed to waiting for opportunities, to actively seek them. “With the industry booming in both Ireland and the UK, many cities are seeing the benefits of being shovel-ready for companies. “Most cities and councils on these islands have already developed their own film departments to showcase their own locations. We have not.” Cllr Cusack said the success of Derry Girls in particular had shown Derrys potential as a location for TV and film production but added that the council had to be serious about building on that success.     She also asked that the council do more to support and promote young local broadcasting talent. “As a council we need to be moving forward with the times, trends and technology. Film and broadcast is an intrinsic part of every day le now and council need to embrace that. “Ultimately, we want jobs and long-term opportunities to improve lives and the economy here. “Finally, and to steal a line from a famous movie, I firmly believe thatwe build it they will come.” Cllr Cusacks motion was supported by all other parties on the council. Sinn Fein councillor Conor Heaney said the film and TV industry had great potential. “I think it definitely should be a focus for the Business and Culture committee of this council,” he said. The motion was also supported by DUP Alderman Keith Kerrigan who highlighted the impact that the filming of Game of Thrones in Northern Ireland had on the tourism industry. However, Alderman Kerrigan said it was important that the entire council region was marketed and not just the city. People Before Profit councillor Maeve ONeill praised the trailblazers in Derry who had worked in the TV and film industry for many years. She said some of these old hands could be used as part of efforts to develop the local potential. Alliance councillor Rachael Ferguson also highlighted the potential for local colleges to get involved in the initiative. Ulster Unionist councillor Derek Hussey said the motion was a no brainer and he was fully in support of it. Alderman Hussey said he could not understand why a film had never been made about the  Siege of Derry.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Candystripes are the only team in the Premier Division without a home win so far, but since the arrival of new manager Ruaidhri Higgins, they have been superb on the road, winning at Sligo Rovers, Bohemians and Waterford and drawing with champions Shamrock Rovers. That elusive home win was just minutes away against St. Patrick’s Athletic on Monday evening, only for a late equaliser to deny the hosts the three points. It was not from lack of effort however against one of the Premier Division’s most improved teams. googletag.cmd.push “We had to dig in,” midfielder Ciaron Harkin said. “It was a scrap all over the pitch and it was hard at times to get the ball down and get it moving as both teams got in each other’s faces trying to cancel each other out. I thought we dug in well and we had the chance to win it, but we conceded a goal at the end. “We don’t really look at that home record. Be it home games or away games, you get the same points. It’s about working on our performances and trying to get as many points on the board and as many wins as possible. It wasn’t our day , we thought it was when Joe put us into the lead, but we’ll just have to keep digging in and go to Friday and push even harder for another win.” googletag.cmd.push Those three away wins have made City one of the most consistent teams in the ision away from home. Bohemians’ - win over Dundalk on Monday night shows just how dficult away games can be, making that recent away record all the more impressive according to Harkin. “The away form has been good so hopefully we can keep the confidence and the consistency up,” he continued. “Obviously it is tough playing away from home but everyone is working hard together so hopefully we can get the three points. “It’s about consistency. You see Dundalk go and get a good win against Rovers, the league leaders. But then they get beaten by Bohs this week, so anything can happen and it’s about making sure you’re on the right end of it and you can push up that table, which is the main thing.”     Midfielder Marc Walsh is the only injury doubt for Higgins as City chase the win which could see them leapfrog Dundalk into seventh.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It was a night of drama from first whistle to the last as City were very nearly embarrassed by a Drogheda team which finished the game with  men. The quarterfinal game took place on September , with City hoping to reach their second FAI Cup final in three years. Things looked to be going to plan for Derry boss Peter Hutton and his players when Ryan McBride scored to give the visitors an early lead. googletag.cmd.push Drogheda’s joy at equalising through Alan McNally ten minutes later was tempered by a red card to Peter McGlynn, with the hosts facing the prospect of playing with ten men for over an hour. It got worse for Drogheda as they were then reduced to nine men, with Shane Grimes bring red carded early in the second half. Incredibly though, the hosts then took the lead with another goal from McNally, and Derry were on their way out of the cup. Relentless The Candy Stripes knocked relentlessly at the Drogheda door but the goal just would not come. It was sheer desperation for City who completely dominated with their numerical advantage. googletag.cmd.push It was all or nothing and with just five minutes remaining, midfielder Philip Lowry was in the right place at the right time to volley Derry level. The drama was far from finished however as Drogheda were then reduced to eight men with Gavin Holohan receiving his marching orders. It seemed certain that Derry would find a winner in the time remaining, but the hosts held on to set up a replay at the Brandywell just four days later. City won the replay -, with Rory Patterson scoring a hat trick and Michael Duffy and Patrick McEleney also scoring. They beat Shamrock Rovers in the semi-final before losing - to St. Patrick’s Athletic in the final.       --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

His -year playing career ended on the Evergreens in the early s.Joersquos role as match secretary for twenty years was absolutely crucial given his unique ability to dig out players when all seemed lost, recruiting players at Down High on Saturday mornings to fulfil fixtures later that day.Complete strangers would often turn up for second  matches in the early days saying that Joe had instructed them to turn up and play.Despite his tireless work on behalf of the club, Joersquos greatest pleasure throughout his rugby le has been the friends he has made along the way.A keen tourist, he has travelled the world to follow rugby and even took in some of the Lions fixtures in South Africa in .He was tour manager on the legendary  Ballynahinch tour of Canada, as well as partaking in a few trips away with the Evergreens.When promotion to the All-Ireland League was secured in , Joe was a regular spectator at games all over the country and could be seen at every first XV home fixture in his familiar spot on the m line until very recently.The flat cap, long navy Adidas coat, familiar cough and half pint of Harp should conjure up an image of Joe to everyone who knows him, and to countless others who have passed through the Ballynahinch club in recent years not knowing the huge influence he has had on their rugby.Joe is the recipient of the coveted Spence Cup this season. He is truly deserving of this award and it is le-affirming to see that friendships gained through team sports run deep as Sam Robinson, himself a Spence Cup winner, acts as carer for Joe as his health deteriorates.Rugby it seems, is giving something back to one of itrsquos finest local servants.On behalf of the Spence family, Emma Rice commened: ldquoThe Spence Cup is given to a member who shows an example of commitment to the rugby club. Joe Carlislersquos service to the club in time and deed epitomises this.ldquoA society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they will never sit in. We are often guilty of not noticing a tree that gives the shade we sit under, she continued.ldquoPlayers of today may no longer see as much of that familiar face on the m line at Ballymacarn Park, but they will see the roots, the structure, the shade and benefit from what wee Joe once planted. Thank you and congratulations, Joe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Business.jpg","title":"Business owners join forces in their love of baking  ","story":"THEY became virtual supporters of each otherrsquos business during lockdown mdash now two women bakers are working together to raise money for dementia research.Ciara Van Vogt, the owner of Margaretrsquos Cottage BB in Ardglass and Sharon Campbell from Mrs Crsquos Home Kitchen in Dundrum, have raised pound, so far for the Alzheimerrsquos Society from an online bake sale.They supported each otherrsquos business efforts through lockdown last year by connecting on social media but did not meet in person until March.When they did, the two ladies struck up an immediate friendship and decided to put their skills together and collaborate on a project.Sharon said: ldquoDuring lockdown charities have really suffered and there are many worthy causes out there, we both agreed it was hard to support just one.ldquoBoth businesses support their own inidual local charities and will continue to do, but we chose to support an Alzheimerrsquos charity because we both know many people affected by this awful disease.Ciara is a carer for her elderly mother, Mrs Eithne Fitzsimons, who was diagnosed with Alzheimerrsquos disease four years ago.ldquoI lose a bit of Mum every week, and sometimes Mum doesnrsquot know who I am, said Ciara.ldquoLockdown has stopped support groups and activities for people with dementia. Itrsquos been very challenging for carers and their loved ones, and people often forget that carersrsquo lives are adversely affected too.ldquoImagine having a spouse or parent who no longer recognises you and who due to this awful disease you no longer recognise.One of the things that resonates with both women is the thought of any loved one losing all our precious memories.Ciara continued: ldquoResearch into the causes of, and treatment for dementia is critically important but not a priority for UK governments.ldquoWe would love to see this dreadful disease eradicated for future generations. We both have strong ties to Northern Ireland, being from here, although we both spent time living and working in England and Scotland before moving home to settle back in Co Down. Our mutual love of baking and cooking was how we met and became friends.The two bakers organised a virtual bake sale to raise money for dementia research.However they soon realised that due to geography not everyone could buy their fabulous baking, so they set up a JustGiving page to run alongside the bake sale.ldquoPlanning the challenges of a bake sale during lockdown was fun, so too was choosing some of our most popular products to sell to raise money, said Sharon.ldquoThe menu proved so popular. Within ten days we both realised we wouldnrsquot get much sleep as baking for Alzheimerrsquos became a top priority.Early mornings and late nights meant that customers received their sweet treats and funds are still being raised by the pair.If you want to check out their Just Giving page, details are: https:www.justgiving fundraising sharonandciarasbakesale and both ladies can be found on Facebook and Instagram..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Campbell.jpg","title":"Campbell on form as Duns claim derby win  ","story":"DUNDRUM firsts defeated derby rivals Downpatrick by  runs on Friday evening to continue their push for a semi-final spot in the T Shield.Dundrum travelled to the Strangford Road after their pitch was deemed unplayable after heavy rain with the home side winning the toss and, on a cold damp evening, chose to field first.Dundrum opened with Greg Hutley and Stuart Campbell while Downpatrick opened the bowling with Justin Rea and Marty Gartland.Dundrum got off to a fast start adding  for the first wicket inside the first six overs before Hutley was dismissed for  off the bowling of Gartland.Dundrumrsquos run rate began to halt as a result of the combination of good Downpatrick bowling and a slow outfield.Terry Hutley and Campbell added  for the next wicket before Dundrum lost four quick wickets in the form of Campbell , Hutley , James Martinand Joel Maguire .This left Dundrum  for five with Downpatrick on top as Ian Wright and Gavin McNerlin added  for the next wicket before another clump of wickets fell to leave Dundrum  for nine after  overs.McNerlin managed to get Dundrum to  for nine from their  overs as he finished on  not out.The pick of the Downpatrick bowlers was James Ferguson who finished with figures of  for  from his four overs and the game was very much in the balance heading into the second innings.Downpatrick opened with brothers Michael and Daniel Carson whilst Dundrum elected to open the bowling with Davy Glover and Daniel Kearsley.Similar to Dundrumrsquos innings, Downpatrick got off to a fast start, putting on  for the first wicket inside the first six overs.The Downpatrick men combined well and began running fluently between the wickets to put the pressure on the Dundrum bowlers.Daniel Carsonwas dismissed off the bowling of Davy Glover after a good catch by Andrew Foster in the dee, with Paul Linehan next to the crease to join Michael Carson.Linehan looked to be aggressive, hitting a big six to keep the pressure on Dundrum as the two batsmen took the score to  for  inside nine overs.However, Dundrum began to fight back through Campbell and McNerlin. The former dismissed both Carson and Linehan in the same over to swing the match back in favour for Dundrum.This started a Downpatrick collapse with the last eight wickets falling for only  runs. McNerlin finished with figures of  for  from four overs while Campbell finished with  for  from his four overs, completing a -run win for Dundrum.It was a fantastic fight back for Dundrum and Downpatrick will know they let the game get away from them.Dundrum would like to thank Downpatrick Cricket Club for hosting the game with the match ball sponsored by Aiden McCabe from AMC building.Dundrum -Downpatrick  all outT SHIELD.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Despair.jpg","title":"Despair for Down in second defeat  ","story":"DOWN were second best to a Meath side who ran out comfortable winners by a margin of seven points at Armaghrsquos Athletic Grounds on Sunday.Down were forfeiting their home advantage as a result of breaching the GAArsquos Covid- regulations during lockdown and perhaps that, coupled with the torrid weather conditions, attributed to their performance.Paddy Tally signicantly reshuffled his starting line-up following their opening day defeat against Mayo in Castlebar.The Down manager made a total of five changes, with goalkeeper Marc Reid and captain Darren OrsquoHagan the most notable of them all.Meath began the sharper of the two sides, but Down could not fault lady luck as their opponents were reduced to  men following a Eoin Harkey black card.The red and black outfit failed to take advantage of their additional man as Meath began scoring points through Cathal Hickey, Mathew Costello and Andrew Colgan.Corey Quinn did manage to score two points before the quarter for the Mourne county, but he also failed to convert a goal scoring chance which set the tone for the afternoon.The game was not away from Down at this stage as Quinn added to his tally alongside scores from Paul Devlin and Ryan McElroy to trail by only two points at half-time.It was a reverse in roles for the second half, as this time it was Down player Jonny Flynn who was shown the black card, leaving his side down a man.Unlike Down, Meath took full advantage of the extra shirt on the pitch and Cillian OrsquoSullivan buried two goals just before and after the third quarter to put the contest out of sight.Referee Niall Cullen was kept busy with his cards, this time displaying a red to Downrsquos Gerard McGovern to close out a miserable afternoon for Tallyrsquos men.Down now travel to Mullingar this Sunday, where they face off against Westmeath at Cusack Park.Down: M Reid P Fegan, G McGovern, P Murdock, P Laverty, D OrsquoHagan, C Mooney, R McEvoy , J Flynn, J Guinness, B OrsquoHagan , L Kerr, D Guinness, C Quinn , P Devlin .Subs: C Doherty for J Guinness , P Branagan for Mooney , S McConville for Kerr , G Collins for D OrsquoHagan , C Gough for Flynn , C McCrickardfor B OrsquoHagan , D Savage for Quinn Meath: A Colgan , S Lavin, C McGill, C Hickey , E Harkin, S McEntee, D Keogan, B Menton, P Harnan, E Devine , B McMahon , M Costello , J Morris , T OrsquoReilly , C OrsquoSullivan .Subs: R Ryan for Harkin , J Wallace for OrsquoReilly , E Wallacefor Hickey , J Scully for McMahon , J Conlon for Morris , D Campion for OrsquoSullivan , G McCoy for McEntee Referee: Niall Cullen Down -Meath -NFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Dozens.jpg","title":"Dozens walk in memory of Seaforde Special Olympian  ","story":"UPWARDS of  people took part in a charity walk around Castlewellan Lake on Saturday in memory of Seaforde man Glenn McBride, who died  weeks ago.Glennwas a medalled Special Olympics competitor who enjoyed soccer and basketball, playing both to a high standard.He was a popular member of of Down Special Olympics Club in Downpatrick and Shimna Stars Special Olympics Club in Newcastle.Glenn won a soccer gold medal with Team Down at the Area Games in Belfast in  and was a member of the Ulster soccer team at the Ireland Games the following year.

But also to strengthen school community and pride in our fantastic school.Mr Austin paid tribute to the schools PTFA for its fundraising, to the board of governors for support and a group of volunteers who worked on the welcome garden.ldquoThe team spirit that has been displayed throughout this project has been uplting and a reflection of the strong school community that exists within St Colmcilles Primary School, he said.ldquoThe board of governors have supported this project throughout and are committed to a cycle of continuous improvement of all aspects of the school, especially its facilities and resourcesHe continued: ldquoThe PTFA have fundraised relentlessly through organising ious raffles, draws, bingos and hampers.

We wanted the money we raised to benefit every child in the school and therefore the school have all the children timetabled for outdoor learning everyday.ldquoThis makes our fundraising all worthwhile when you see happy children playing daily outdoors.The PTFA organised fundraising initiatives like bingo, raffles, hampers and draws which have allowed the school to further develop the footprint of the planned facilities for the children.The schoolrsquos Rainbow garden includes a tepee, a water wall for directing and controlling the flow of water, an activity table, a water and sand tray, outdoor shelter, sensory plants with a vivid colour or smell and plastic coated activity table where children can paint use sand and textiles to show their learning.Therersquos also an outdoor classroom which can hold up to  pupils and adults with bespoke seating and a blackboard with outdoor musical equipment.Itrsquos contained within ranch style fencing and is very popular with all the schoolrsquos pupils, particularly those within its learning support centres, many of whom have complex sensory needs.The new play park contains swings, slide, climbing tower, monkey bars, balance equipment, ropes, seesaws seating and planting areas.Children are timetabled at break and lunch times and for certain lessons throughout the day.An eye-catching circular stone planter has been filled with a iety of shrubs and trees in the new Welcome garden.Therersquos also a bespoke reading area overlooking four large rectangular sleeper planter boxes filled with beautul summer flowers, a solar powered water fountain, a bird bath and bird tables..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Politicians.jpg","title":"Politicians gather to mark Northern Ireland centenary  ","story":"CROSSGAR marked Northern Irelandrsquos centenary on Monday with a special event.A number of local politicians including South Down MLA Harry Harvey and Rowallane councillors Billy Walker, Terry Andrews, Robert Burgess and Kathryn Owen met in the village square with each holding a torch which symbolised what happened in Crossgar a century ago when the province was formed.On that occasion, a bonfire was lit in the square by local residents to celebrate the creation of Northern Ireland on election night of the new parliament.The local MP was Sir James Craig, the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who had personal ties to Crossgar and had been its Westminster MP since .To mark the national and local event, local politicians from all parties were invited to hold a flame in a triangular shape on Monday symbolising the fire that was lit on the birth of the country in .Cllr Walker said he was delighted to have been invited to Crossgar to take part in the special event to mark Northern Irelandrsquos th birthday..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26May2021-Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to Down Rec soccer legend Jim Connolly  ","story":"JIM Connolly died on April  after a hard fought two year battle with illness.His passing was marked by a phenomenal level of tributes.Social media,work colleagues, team-mates and opponents alike expressed how well liked and respected he was in all walks of le.He was first and last a family man whether it was his brothers and sisters, Angie and his children or his beloved grandchildren.However Coot, as he was known, had another family which he held dear. He had been a vital cog in the Down Rec team which enjoyed great success in the late Seventies.But it was and remains the case that the Down Rec experience is defined by the enduring friendships which have stood the test of time.Coot grew up in Stream Street and the reason he knocked back opportunities to perform at levels his talent merited may well lie there.That part of Downpatrick had three working class housing developments, Ardpatrick and Russell Park with Stream Street and Ibrox Park in the middle.Ibrox was their playground, the place where Coot first kicked a football.He was a Stream Street kid and it seems he never wanted to be anything .When Jim Prior took him to Down Rec, it was a marriage made in heaven.In that dressing room you had another more senior Stream Street kid. Coot would have idolized Tony lsquoDartrsquo Curran in those days as he was the leader of the pack.Russell Park resident Barney Fitzsimmons was there too, a swashbuckling goalscorer who enjoyed something akin to Roy of the Rovers status at the time.Then you had the late great Paddy lsquoGeordyrsquo Galbraith, who combined a hard man reputation with a heart of gold.Peter Mulhall was another player he would have admired, a winner who proved the perfect centre back partner for the laid-back Coot.The total respect he had for them was accorded to all of us even though he was a better player than any of us. That was Coot Connolly.Prior realized that he needed to recruit from outside Downpatrick to fulfill his ambitions for the club and over a period of time he recruited players from Portaferry, Strangford, Ardglass, Dundrum, Crossgar, Saintfield, Killyleagh and Ballygowan.They were brought in for their ability but Jim couldnrsquot have known that the erse personalities therein would create the perfect storm in the dressing room.Neither could he have anticipated the level of support which flowed from those villages in the seasons to come.Dressing rooms are bastions of banter and slagging and with Dart jester-in chief, the group relished every minute they spent together.The five strong Portaferry contingent proved to be a vital ingredient, their earthy Ards humour and the opportunities their accents provided for slagging sealing their popularity.Jackie Leckey and Barney Ross brought another dimension willing as they were to join in the shenanigans on and off the pitch. Coot loved the craic and happily joined in the banter.However, he left the slagging to other less sensitive creatures of which there were plenty.A good example was the time I decided to get the footballers perm which was in vogue at the time. I should have known better.I got slaughtered, Dart declaring that I looked more like Shirley Temple than Kevin Keegan.Those were the days, as the saying goes, but happily there were plenty of good days ahead of us.We have had many reunions with Coot, an ever present and every one of them underlined the strength of the bond we enjoy so much.Sadly those reunions tend to be confined to wakes and funerals nowadays and the baby of our team has now joined Shane Breen, Paddy Galbraith and Marty Ross on the sidelines.Coot would have been the first to remind me that the Rec wasnrsquot only about the players.The one and only Charlie Oakes was highly influential in his role as assistant manager, while Austy Keating doubled as chairman and groundsman for many years.Joe Lyttle was our physio and his son Joea loyal player for years while my sister Tina was a committee member and a fanatical fan.They were all fully paid up members of the Rec family and we continue to mourn their loss.I would love to have name checked every single member of the Rec family in this piece but time and space didnrsquot allow. My apologies.The laughter which rang through Cootrsquos house during his wake was a fitting farewell for someone who loved to laugh.He was a very special human being. We will miss him forever.

Alban seems to think that it’s all right to weaken Israel’s defence capability relative to neighbouring Muslim states. Because I found Mr Maginness’ article to be objectionable, in the antipathic attitude it expresses towards Israel, I wrote to the editor of the Belfastand which letter may bear repeating. My letter reads: “Alban Maginness gives a rather one-sidedview of the ongoing conflict in the Holy Land. The Belfast , May . “Alban views the conflict from a narrow Northern Ireland perspective: he appears to be blind to the geographic and political realities of the Middle East and Israel’s precarious security situation there. “In the ongoing conflict, it is Israel that is the beleaguered state and Israel is, and has always been, facing an existential threat from the neighbouring States. By comparison with these states, Israel is a tiny Jewish state with little by way of natural geographical defences for its protection against the much larger surrounding Muslim states and hostile forceswith their huge land mass, oil and other resources and populations amounting to hundreds of millions. “To look at the Holy Land conflict exclusively as a Jewish Palestinian problem without reference to this much bigger political, geographical and military landscape, seems to be poor,not threadbare, analysis.”Micheal O’Cathail, By email• Jackie Goodall: Ireland shows itself to be Europe’s most anti-Israel nation——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It is hard to see how a three-way split can be sustained, yet there is a case for two main unionist blocs — a moderate one and a conservative one.There is an increasing view that a single unionist party would just drive more voters to the neutral political centre.The biggest issue by far facing unionism is the NI Protocol Boris Johnson betrayal. Senior DUP politicians have seemed far too willing to accept tough talk from Tories such as Lord Frost. Yet London keeps reiterating its commitment to the protocol, about which Brussels is so uncompromising. The UK says the Act of Union has been partially repealed and we must assume that is the situation . It is an outrage, yet Edwin Poots has to date been pragmatic about this Irish Sea border. Doug Beattie yesterday seemed to say on radio that the protocol was less important than the NHS, but the comparison is misleading because it is an utterly dferent policy area. It is possible both to think that health is the single most important non constitutional matter, but that the constitutional question is the single most important political issue.That is what republicans think, yet they do not allow themselves to be talked into saying the NHS is more important.A united unionist rejection of the repeal of the Act of Union can, and should, exist alongside a wide range of views among unionists on non constitutional matters.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

It’s about ing the DUP to its roots.”However, a source on Mr Poots’s side of the party said that it had been a power struggle and that those who until now had been the party establishment “just can’t come to terms with the fact that they’ve lost power”.Sir Jeffrey, outgoing leader Arlene Foster, Economy Minister Diane Dodds, East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson, East Londonderry MP Gregory Campbell and others then walked out during an interval in the meeting, pointedly not staying to listen to the new leader’s acceptance speech.Former Fermanagh and South Tyrone DUP constituency association chairman Paul Bell resigned on the steps of the Crowne Plaza hotel where the meeting was happening, telling reporters that senior party figures acted to “assassinate our leader”.However, he inadvertently confirmed something which earlier in the week Mrs Foster has questioned — the existence of the letter of no confidence which persuaded her to walk away.Mrs Foster had said that she had not seen the letter and suggested it might not exist, but Mr Bell said: “I think that those  members have a lot to think about — that signed that letter [sic]”.Veteran BBC political corespondent Gareth Gordon, who spent Thursday night at the hotel reporting on the drama, said yesterday: “The poison that’s pouring out is just incredible. It’s almost asit’s been kept bottled up for years ... nobody is trying to hide it.”Yesterday did not see a slew of public resignations from the party, but there was a mutinous atmosphere among many of those who opposed Mr Poots for the leadership.Some senior figures on Sir Jeffrey Donaldson’s side of the party are considering radical options.Last night one such inidual did not dismiss the idea of a string of unionist independents banding together in an alliance — although they accepted that there is not space for a fourth major unionist party.When askedthe imperative to unite for next year’s crucial assembly election will bring the party together behind the new leader or whether the isions are too deep to be bridged, he said: “I think it’s the latter more than the former. “We will lose people.”He added that it was “a huge mistake on Edwin’s part” to deny the party executive a secret vote on whether to raty him as leader.As the party spin about being a “family” was exposed, last night the PSNI confirmed they were investigatinga complaint that members of the party had been threatened during the leadership contestJournalist Rodney Edwards reported that Sir Jeffrey told Thursday night’s meeting that the UDA had “threatened” some of his team during the contest.The DUP said in a statement: “There was no intimidation or bullying. Any suggestions are baseless and without foundation. “Executive members freely expressed their opinions without fear or favour.”Mr Poots yesterday condemned the allegation and said that the police should deal with it.Yesterday Mrs Foster confirmed that she plans to leave the DUP and local politics entirely when she resigns as first minister. And the DUP leader threatened to quit that post next weekMr Poots decides to carry a reshuffle of the party’s ministerial team.When askedshe had any regrets, she said: “All of us are going to look back and wish we had done some things dferently. But it’s important to learn from that – everyone makes mistakes, but we should use the lessons from this to move forward.”Yesterday former DUP councillor Guy Spence, who quit the party last year in circumstance which have not been publicly explained, said on Twitter: “When I felt the wrath of the twisted, bitter, hateful culture of the DUP over a year ago I asked the leadership for an investigation.“They washed their hands and looked the other way without responding, instead focusing on spin and deflection.“A year on, they now know what it feels like as the stench brewing on their watch has erupted all over themselves.”Reflecting on the public stre, former DUP MLA David McIlveen said that “the ramications for the unionist family are potentially catastrophic”.He told the Nolan Show that  was “a year in which unionism should have been rejuvenating itself” as it marked the centenary but instead the DUP was tearing itself apart.The former North Antrim MLA said that “the only losers in this are unionism” and that for those losing positions at the top of the DUP “le will go on for them”, but unionism will suffer.Mr McIlveen, the son of Free Presbyterian minister the Rev David McIlveen, said that “there is a culture of fear within the party” and that “no lessons have been learned” by the party since the RHI scandal.New Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie, whose ratication as leader on Thursday was as smooth as the DUP’s was messy, said that his party was talking to at least five DUP councillors but they must “share our vision” before joining.:Sam McBride: A curious episode shows that the NI protocol is now too confusing for even the EU to understandSam McBride: After four years at the top of Sinn Féin, Michelle O’Neill has good reason to be nervousSam McBride: Rather than a DUP lurch to the right, this is about toppling the old orderSam McBride: Is stolen Northern Bank cash in politics  Alarmingly, no one seems botheredSam McBride: How Arlene Foster fell: Even as she dismissed the threat, the knives were being plungedAs Edwin Poots steps forward to contest DUP leadership, Peter Robinson urges cautionSam McBride: The most important firm in Northern Ireland you’ve probably never heard of – but are paying forSam McBride: On the streets and in Stormont, the next few months look bleak for Northern IrelandAnarchy on the Shankill as men and women urge children to riot, with no hint of political protestLeaked internal DUP minutes show fear of looming electoral collapse, and dismay at party’s directionBrandon Lewis interview: Denial of the Irish Sea border is gone as SoS says parts of frontier are being ditched for good——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt was girl power when ten female walkers joined Joy and sheepdog Bracken from Penarth and District Ramblers at Penarth clftop for an . mile walk, with no stiles only gates and which would see them experiencing the weather of all four seasons in one day. They set off on a socially distanced walk in lovely spring sunshine across the old pitch and putt course before joining part of the old railway line, now a walk and cycle way, and heading through a built up area Lavernock Road led them into Cosmeston Country Park.Past the eastern lake with its floating jetty where canoes can be safely launched and making their way through the eastern paddock with its carpet of pretty cowslips, open meadows led them towards Old Cogan Hall Farm, where they deviated into the churchyard of St Peterrsquos for morning break in glorious warm sunshine reminiscent of summer. Admiring the herring bone masonry which dates to Celtic and Saxon times and the ancient yew trees that could even pre-date this lovely old church, which allegedly is the oldest building in Penarth and hearing some of its long and interesting history, it fell into disrepair in the th century. By the th century the ruinous building was a cattle shelter until the latter part of the rsquos when the rd Marquis of Bute was persuaded to pay for its renovation.Mile Road built by the Bute family led them to the western paddock and through the sun-dappled Cogan Wood to re-enter fields where a footbridge led them across the Sully Brook for the short climb up to Home Farm, with its glorious views towards the eastern end of Barry and the surrounding farmland. Exiting through a gate, some road walking in a southerly direction brought them into Sully village and pounding pavements to reach the Jubilee Hall and the cricket field, the full beauty of Sully Bay with its views across the Bristol Channel towards the Somerset coastline and Hayes Point to the west confronted them.     With the wind beginning to pick up they tramped by track and field to the public slipway at Sully beach and stopped for lunch utilising rocks for seating whilst gazing eastwards towards Sully Island and Flat and Steep Holm beyond, as clouds thickened overhead and the temperature dropped making it feel more like autumn.Time to move on along part of the long distance Wales Coast Path, through the playing fields to exit onto Beach Road, following it to the car park of the Captainrsquos We where there were only a few people sitting at outdoor tables for food and drink, not really enjoyable in the cool breeze.The fairly quiet St Maryrsquos Well Bay Road brought them up past The Bay Caravan Park and into fields with growing crops where, without any warning a sudden short sharp shower of rain engulfed the group forcing coats to be swtly donned.Crossing a wooden footbridge into the delightful Lavernock Nature Reserve the grassy path led them into the remains of the WW gun emplacements. Initially in the late rsquos the original Lavernock Gun Battery was built to protect the Bristol and Cardf shipyards and the Bristol Channel, but unfortunately most of the original buildings now lie underneath the caravan park.Being bombarded by a short hail storm whilst moving on through the nature reserve, lovingly cared for by volunteers and passing the man-made pond with its surrounding carpet of bluish violet bugle, a plant which attracts moths, butterflies and bees, before exiting onto Fort Road their route led them past the Marconi Holiday Village and the Church of St Lawrence before heading along the clftop. With thick black clouds heading up the English side of the Bristol Channel, the race was on to get back before the rain hit. As the weather turned wintry and the wind increased, a huge shower of hailstones and heavy rain struck them on the open Penarth clftop soaking them as they made their way back to their start point.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits before, during and after lockdown on Facebook. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityMore than  local people are urging the Cardf and Vale University Health Boardto build a health centre on Eagleswell Road, where a former primary school closed in .The disused plot of land is currently owned by Vale of Glamorgan council, and is allocated for  potential houses in the local development plan.But campaigners want the council to allow the health board to build a new health centre there, complaining the townrsquos current surgeries arenrsquot up to scratch.Councillor Gwyn John, of the Llantwit First Independent party, is organising the petition. He raised concerns that the hundreds of new houses in and around Llantwit Major arenrsquot seeing the increased investment in local public services needed to cater for the growing population.He said: ldquoThere are more and more houses in the town. Therersquos hardly any green space left and our services are really struggling.Two doctors surgeries currently cater for the town: Coastal Vale and Western Vale. Cllr John claimed Coastal Vale is ldquoat capacity and the Western Vale building is ldquoover  years old.He said: ldquoThe actual building needs replacing, itrsquos not in a great condition. It needs replacing and modernising.Cardf and Vale UHB is drawing up plans for major changes on how clinical services are delivered. This will likely see three lsquohealth and wellbeing centresrsquo with services like x-rays, out-of-hours GPs, community mental health teams, and ambulatory care.MORE NEWS:The health board is also planning nine lsquowellbeing hubsrsquo, either developing existing places like health centres, leisure centres or libraries or in new buildings such as Maelfa in Cardf. These wellbeing hubs will include GP services, midwery, and primary mental health care.     The idea is to move clinical services away from large hospitals like the University Hospital of Wales, at the Heath in Cardf, avoiding the need for people to travel long distances for care.Cllr John supports this move but says residents in the western part of the Vale of Glamorgan are currently undeserved with health services mdash and with the hundreds of new houses being built in the area, Llantwit would be ideal for a new health centre.He is hoping to get many more signatures for his petition to build the new health centre in Llantwit Major, with a table set up on the precinct in the town on Saturday, for residents who arenrsquot on the internet or havenrsquot seen the campaign online yet.He said: ldquoItrsquos all very well building homes, thatrsquos fine. But we have to have the infrastructure.The health board said any investment in new health and wellbeing centres or wellbeing hubs is some time away.A Cardf and Vale UHB spokesperson said: ldquoThe intention is for a wellbeing hub to be placed in the western Vale, but this may be some years away as part of our overall plan. In terms of where the site will be based, this will be subject to an engagement process.ldquoThere will be a health and wellbeing centre in the Vale work will be commencing in terms of engagement in relation to this within the next few months.A Vale of Glamorgan council spokesperson said: ldquoAny need for a new medical centre would be a matter for the Cardf and Vale University Health Board.ldquoNo planning application for such a building has been submitted and currently the land in question has been allocated as a signicant strategic development site for the councilrsquos house building programme.
