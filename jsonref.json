Abraham-Joseph, 26, has three children who are American citizensLaw firm Kuck Baxter Immigration released a statement earlier this week saying US officials have known about Abraham-Joseph\u0027s immigration status since at least 2017 when he sought a new visa, and while that application is pending the rapper should not be subject to detainment. Spiro, the New York attorney who at one time represented rap mogul Jay-Z, has taken on Abraham-Joseph\u0027s case at his famous client\u0027s request this week. \u0027The arrest and detention of 21 Savage is an absolute travesty, his U visa petition has been pending for 4 years,\u0027 Jay-Z posted on Facebook.The U visa is for victims of crimes who have faced mental or physical abuse. His team earlier had said it was filed due to his experience as a \u0027victim of a deadly shooting in 2013.\u0027ICE has said the artist was convicted of felony drug charges in October 2014, but Spiro said it was a marijuana conviction that was vacated.The rapper\u0027s legal team said earlier that he arrived in the US at age seven, staying there continually for almost 20 years except for a brief trip to Britain in 2005. Abraham-Joseph has three children who are American citizens, which his lawyers say make him eligible for deportation relief.\u0027In addition to being a successful recording artist, 21 deserves to be reunited with his children immediately,\u0027 Jay-Z said.    The Grammy-nominated artist was put in deportation proceedings because he has been living in the US illegally since 2006 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2019/02/07/22/06705A25000007D0-0-image-m-3_1549578038636.jpg","title":"Parents told turn phones set example youngsters","story":"    Damian Hinds (pictured) urged mothers and fathers to ‘put their phones away’ to show their offspring that ‘restricting screen time is a good thing’          Mr Hinds said families need to spend more time together without constant ‘distractions’ from Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat – breaking the cycle of ‘always being contactable’And he also revealed his own children, aged nine, seven and five, do not have mobile phones but do have access to two e-readers in the home so they can read digital books.Experts have stressed that it is hard for parents to enforce strict rules on social media for children when they are always on it themselves.Speaking at the Church of England’s annual schools leadership conference yesterday, Mr Hinds highlighted the issue of cyberbullying. He said: ‘It is quite easy to say, “limit children’s screen time”. Actually it’s our screen time that we need to limit first.‘We are saying spend time together – that does also involve grown-ups putting their phones away.

And he is now effectively trying to acquiesce in Brexit, because ultimately he believes that Brexit will be good for our country. I think he’s wrong about that.’ Chuka Umunna, another former Labour frontbencher, reacted angrily to Mr Corbyn’s intervention, describing it as ‘totally demoralising’. He added: ‘This is not opposition, it is the facilitation of a deal which will make this country poorer. A strong, coherent Labour alternative to this shabby, Tory Brexit is absent - it has been since this Parliament began.’ Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, who is pushing for a second referendum, accused Mr Corbyn of ‘offering to help a Tory government enable Brexit.’ Senior EU figures also seized on Mr Corbyn’s intervention as evidence that the UK could be pushed into accepting a soft Brexit. EU president Donald Tusk twisted the knife yesterday by telling Mrs May that Jeremy Corbyn’s plan for a soft Brexit could be a ‘promising way out of the current impasse’.During tense talks in Brussels, Mr Tusk is said to have urged her to consider a cross-party compromise based around permanent membership of the customs union.An EU source confirmed Mr Tusk had suggested Mr Corbyn’s plan was a ‘promising way out of the impasse.’ Joining a customs union would breach one of Mrs May’s negotiating red lines and end the dream of striking post-Brexit trade deals. Conservative chairman Brandon lewis has also warned Mrs May that siding with Labour on the issue would split the party.

A. Milne\u0027s poem Now We Are Six ends: \u0027But now I am six, I\u0027m as clever as clever. So I think I\u0027ll be six now for ever and ever.\u0027 That\u0027s how I felt that day. Over subsequent decades my \u0027spirit age\u0027 was mostly far older than my real vintage.The first LP I bought, aged 12, from the Cirencester branch of FW Woolworth, was Bach\u0027s Brandenburg Concertos. As a teenager I ached to wear baggy corduroys and smoke a pipe. I have owned only one pair of jeans and they were not a success.          Quentin Letts says his spirit age is around one year older than his actual age At university in Ireland I hated the pressure to be \u0027with it\u0027 and dated a beautiful Belfast artist who was ten years my senior. As a 30-year-old reporter, I envied older journalists who had seen the world and mastered their craft.When I married Lois in 1996, I knew she was a cracker yet felt itchy when grannies cooed over us as \u0027love\u0027s young dream\u0027 and told us: \u0027It\u0027s all in front of you.\u0027 I didn\u0027t want to be young. I wanted to be established, successful, my own man, with a lawnmower and a drinks cabinet and shoe-trees.Now I\u0027ve got them and it feels right.In The Idiot, Dostoyevsky writes that 56 is the age at which real life can begin: a \u0027fine complexion, sound though discoloured teeth, a stocky, solid figure, a preoccupied air in the morning, a gay face in the evening\u0027.There is also, though this he omitted, a disposition to pity anyone younger, and a sense of relief to have left behind youth\u0027s gulping gawkishness. Thank heavens for middle age.EVEN AT 56 I STILL GET SCHOOLGIRL CRUSHESSusannah ConstantineReal age: 56. Spirit age: 16.          Susannah Constantine \u0027still get schoolgirl crushes\u0027So, Christie Brinkley jokes that she\u0027s turning 50 for the 15th time, declaring her spirit age is far younger than her 65 years. Why has she chosen an age that is ten years older than she looks?When it comes to how I feel, I\u0027d put it at somewhere around 16. I still get schoolgirl crushes and it would be wonderful to have no responsibilities. Often, I see myself in my children and it makes me laugh when I tell them to behave or grow up, when inside I\u0027m wanting to do exactly the same as them, despite the statins, hot flushes and insomnia.I yearn to eat rubbish as often as I like without pumping up the cholesterol levels. I\u0027d love to be able to sleep until noon. It would be heaven to have a night on the tiles and not look like stale bread the next morning.Sadly, at the ripe old age of 56, it would be unwise to live my spiritual age because it could take me to an early grave.    Henry Deedes\u0027s spirit age is the age he got married My spirit age — 28 — is the age I got married. That\u0027s not a dig at my ex-wife, we had many wonderful times. Still do. But I feel younger now than I did then.Midlife complacency set in prematurely after marrying. The burden of responsibility meant I neglected myself.Week nights covering the canape-and-Krug party circuit had left my skin sallow, my belly blubberous. Home life was often a whir of bills and builders as I tottered under the weight of a mortgage bigger than the Brexit orce fee.These days, I eat better, drink less and am mildly more solvent. Frequent exercise means I can wear T-shirts again without feeling like a lager-tummied extra from Benidorm. That feeling of youthful spontaneity is wonderful. I have a sense of adventure again.Every now and again I get a quick reality check. Hangovers get harder. Hair gets greyer. And yesterday I ordered a hip support from Amazon to wear in the gym — but let\u0027s not dwell on that.CHILDREN CAN TELL I\u0027M NOT A GROWN-UPRowan PellingReal age: 51. Spirit age: 15.I have never lied about my age and told everyone when I turned 50 last year. But that might be because I am certain, deep down, that the largest part of me remains resolutely 15.          Rowan Pelling never lied about her age I have spent my life avoiding certain adult responsibilities (tax returns, form-filling, housework, the duller side of childrearing) and veering off into my own vivid, imaginary world.I still make the kind of intense friendships I made at school and like sloping away from chores like a naughty schoolgirl having a ciggie behind the bike sheds.My life would have fallen apart, I suspect, if I hadn\u0027t married a proper grown-up who provides the necessary domestic balance. I happily wear clothes many peers would judge to be age-inappropriate, such as skinny jeans, short skirts and bikinis, and only yesterday I received a Sex Pistols T-shirt in the post.Children (little girls in particular) often recognise I\u0027m not a real grown-up and are happy to talk to me about unicorns, imaginary friends and dragons. If there\u0027s a trampoline or a game of \u0027It\u0027, I\u0027m first in the queue.My chief guilty pleasure is nestling in an armchair with a clutch of favourite children\u0027s books.I don\u0027t think I chase youth: I\u0027ve never had Botox or filler and I\u0027m happy with my wrinkles. But I suspect feeling young is what makes a person buzz, not looking it. If I were ever to have a tattoo, then it would say simply: \u0027There are no rules.\u0027IN MY DREAMS I\u0027M 17 AND A RUGBY HEROStanley JohnsonReal age: 78. Spirit age: 17.          Stanley Johnson dreams of being a rugby hero Even now, I dream about my schooldays when I played prop in rugby for Sherborne, aged 17.The other side (Marlborough? Clifton?) kicks off. I catch the ball full-toss and charge straight for the line, looking neither right nor left, to score under the posts.Of course, I\u0027m not arguing that the grit and determination you acquire on the rugger field as a schoolboy is the end of the story. Yes, I wanted to gain a rugger blue at Oxford after I left school, but I also wanted to get a First and be President of the Union.As it happened, I flunked all three goals, but there was one great consolation prize which I have cherished all my life: I won the Newdigate Prize for poetry with a 98-line poem called May Morning. I had to recite it at the university\u0027s summer prize-giving ceremony, Encaenia.Charlie Chaplin was one of those honoured that year. He signed my programme and, 56 years later, I still have it.In a nutshell, my spirit age still hovers around 17. I have the sense that even though I hung up my boots years ago, it\u0027s worth charging full-tilt towards the goal.BEING A YOUNG DAD WAS THE BEST TIMERay ConnollyReal age: 78. Spirit age: 29.Emotionally frozen at the age of 29, that\u0027s what I was. That\u0027s how I still think of myself.It was the age when I became confident that I knew how to do what I was good at.We bought a big, run-down house on my 29th birthday in 1970 and it felt like a new beginning, setting off on a new adventure with a future rich in hope and possibilities.          Ray Connolly is \u0027frozen at the age of 29\u0027That was also the time when I was a young father. I liked the role of being a dad — I still do. Not the sort of dad who helped much around the house, more the type who saw children as people to amuse and who enjoyed being amused by them.I expect lots of men identify with being in their late teens — which suggests to me they must have had more success with girls at that age than I did. Marrying Plum when I was 25 was the best thing I ever did. We\u0027ve grown old together, but still reckon the years when the children were small were the best.It was hard, of course. Not much money, two children and soon another on the way, redecorating all four floors of our home in the evenings — Wedgwood blue and white panels nearly everywhere.Not everything has turned out as I hoped. There have been some mistakes — like selling that perfect house — and setbacks. But I\u0027m still happily working seven days a week, still getting new ideas and beginning new projects. Still feeling all of 29.WE GRANNIES ARE FULL OF ENERGYLynne FranksReal age: 70. Spirit age: 30.I have been in my early 30s for almost 40 years. Although clearly my body is older, my enthusiasm for new projects and my energy are the same, and my creativity is as full-on.          Lynne Franks has \u0027been in my early 30s for almost 40 years\u0027At 70, I am opening three new businesses, have moved to a new home in Somerset where I\u0027ve never lived before, and am still optimistic about love and romance.I know good health is vital to keeping up my energy and I eat well, take the best natural supplements and stay as physically active as I have time for, with regular boxing sessions, daily dog walks, tennis lessons and dancing.But I think it\u0027s my love of life and excitement for what each day will bring that keep me feeling less than half my biological age.I meet so many women in my work as a coach and mentor who are my age and planning their next career. It\u0027s as if being grandmothers and well past the menopause has given us a new lease of life.Laughter, love, creative ideas, hugs and a belief that we can work together to create a new and better kind of world is what keeps me and my friends spiritually 30.IS IT TIME I FOUND A PROPER JOB?Libby PurvesReal age: 69. Spirit age: 27.If you\u0027re a freelance, your spirit age stays shamefully young. Actors and musicians know the feeling, too, and I suspect a lot of us still unconsciously feel about 27.It\u0027s understandable: you have never been a serious employee, corporate executive or brisk office manager never been eligible for a company pension, sick pay, maternity leave or an unfair-dismissal tribunal. So you roam the landscape as bright-eyed and wary as a weasel.          Libby Purves says freelancing keeps you \u0027shamefully young\u0027You always wonder about the next contract or the next gig, and never mind being busy you remember how the young Roy Hudd, complaining of overwork, was told by a grand, old, end-of-the-pier agent: \u0027Roy, a full date-book is a happy pro!\u0027You rather relish the sense of adventure involved in professional insecurity, wondering who might try to hire you next and if you would match up to their style, or be able to tolerate the management\u0027s notorious attitude problem.Like a twentysomething between boyfriends, you have a giddy sense that something intriguing and wonderful might be just around the corner. And when it isn\u0027t, you learn to laugh it off and scrounge around for anything that\u0027s going.Yet you\u0027re not a callow teenager: by the mid-20s you had learned to accept nasty rejection without falling into a furious depression.At the same time, you have started to know your value and your price and nerve yourself occasionally to say: \u0027No.\u0027But always there\u0027s that roving eye for a new chance, and a faint sense that maybe you ought to be looking for a \u0027proper job\u0027.Even when I had two small children and lived in a Suffolk field, it was impossible not to read the situations vacant column and go into some mad fantasy of retraining as a psychiatric nurse, PE teacher or automotive bodyshop manager.And, shame to say, I still do.Royalty, presidents and \u0027the most famous elevator ride in...Michael Avenatti\u0027s estranged wife says she wishes he would...\u0027She is super smart and has great energy\u0027: Stormy Daniels\u0027...Firing up viewers: Today scores best ratings in two years...Share this article    Roger Alton says his body feels 171My passport says I\u0027m 71, but most of the time my body feels 171.Especially in the morning (come on knees, do your stuff and get out of bed) or the afternoon (try not to snooze with your mouth open), not to mention the evening (have a shower, not a bath, or you\u0027ll never get out). Then there\u0027s the nights (not the bloody loo again).All a bit embarrassing for a chap who still thinks he\u0027s 34 — physically, socially and professionally in the prime of life, with a rich circle of sporting and friendship associates.

John Sergeant feels his exact age I get worried when a young person says: \u0027I\u0027m going to go round the world and try to find myself.\u0027This attempt is unlikely to succeed — for we have many selves, from diligent child to grumpy old man, via many other characters on the way.One of my great joys has been being able to take part in a contrasting range of activities, be it Strictly Come Dancing or reporting Parliament and, somehow, making each one my own.To thine own self be true — but I have preferred to be true to mine own selves.My spirit age is highly variable. Sometimes I feel like a teenager, reluctant to get out of bed in the morning. Running up stairs is now a fairly rare pleasure — I am more likely to imagine that my 90th birthday looms.My spirit age also changes as the year progresses. At the moment I have adapted well to being 74.I feel plenty of adventures still lie ahead. But in just over two months I will be 75, and that is a source of unease.I think the best plan is to set my spirit age at 74 until I am ready to take stock."},{"url":null,"title":"Sarah Silverman describes uncomfortable breast ultrasound arrogant male doctor","story":"Sarah Silverman described her uncomfortable visit to the doctor Wednesday          In a lengthy Instagram post, she said the male radiologist began conversing with her while her breasts were exposedSilverman starts by explaining that she had to get an ultrasound after a mammogram Wednesday because she has \u0027dense breasts\u0027. She says the radiologist is the same man she had last year and goes on to explain why she dislikes him.  \u0027He started talking to me about my chest X-ray (I also got a chest X-Ray) and was pontificating with my boobs just out and covered in gel and cold and finally I said \u0027\u0027Hey-can we either talk about this when I’m dressed or WHILE your doing the ultrasound?

I tried to ring Kelly and said I would be off this week, and Kelly said I could not see them at the drop of a hat. \u0027Every time I phoned her it would be inconvenient. There would be \u0027family business\u0027 to see to, or \u0027we are taking them here, or there\u0027\u0027.\u0027The last time was a heated discussion. It was getting to the point where you are beaten down by it. I wanted to see the children.\u0027          Her mother Kelly Peat (pictured) didn\u0027t report her missing for almost eight hours after going to the supermarket and having supperMr Cook said that during their last conversation, Kelly told him: \u0027You just can\u0027t see them when you want to.\u0027The inquest heard he considered talking to a solicitor, but didn\u0027t feel he \u0027had a leg to stand on\u0027.At some point around March 2013, he went to their home – but found it was empty.Mr Cook said: \u0027I went to a friends\u0027 house on the estate, but they said that one morning they woke up and they had upped and gone. I had no idea where they\u0027d gone.\u0027He added the next contact he had with the Peats was on the day after Amber disappeared. Mr Cook told the hearing: \u0027I found out in Facebook so I tried to contact Kelly with the number off the missing person posters.\u0027I got vile abuse off Danny – \u0027she is not your f****** daughter, she wants nothing to do with you, you are nothing but a sperm donor.\u0027I phoned back again and spoke to Danny\u0027s mum. I didn\u0027t get much information. I was in deep shock about it.\u0027He added he didn\u0027t know about any issues surrounding his daughter that the inquest had heard about, including her running away from home previously and problems at school.Mr Cook\u0027s mother Jennifer Lancaster – Amber\u0027s grandmother – then gave evidence.She described her granddaughter as a \u0027lovely, sweet, lovable child\u0027 who \u0027liked to cuddle and play silly girly things like dressing up, and with her make-up bag\u0027.Mrs Lancaster said she saw Amber \u0027quite frequently\u0027 when she was young – but when her son and Kelly split up she only saw her \u0027two or three\u0027 times before her death.One of the occasions was Valentines\u0027 Day in 2013, when Danny wanted to cook Kelly a \u0027romantic meal\u0027 and the children went to stay with her for the weekend.           Danny Peat walks to the Nottingham inquest today alongside an unknown woman   Amber Peat\u0027s biological father Adrian Cook (left) arrived at the inquest of his daughter\u0027s death for the first time today, as the 13-year-old tragic schoolgirl\u0027s grandparents prepared to give evidence But Mrs Lancaster said Amber was \u0027weepy\u0027 because she had overheard a conversation between Kelly and her mother, Dianne Gillibrand, in which they had said she \u0027wouldn\u0027t want them.\u0027Mrs Lancaster said: \u0027I told them I would always want them. How can you not want two little children like that, that give you so much pleasure? It struck me as odd.\u0027Mrs Lancaster next saw the young siblings on Mother\u0027s Day 2013, but they couldn\u0027t stop for long because Kelly was waiting in her car outside. She gave them a pair of charm bracelets, and expected to see them again before she went into hospital that April for a knee operation – but never did.She told the hearing: \u0027I got a message from Kelly to say they loved the bracelets, and that was it. I bought them Easter eggs and sent a message to see if they would be coming for them. \u0027And I wanted to get Amber a birthday present because I was going in hospital. But the message (back) was, \u0027don\u0027t know, not sure\u0027.

She said she had no concerns about her granddaughter\u0027s behaviour, and what had happened \u0027came as a shock\u0027.Referring to the Peats, she said: \u0027They trust you with their kids and then stop you seeing them, and the next thing you know she is missing.\u0027It\u0027s horrible, it really is horrible.\u0027I phoned Kelly\u0027s number and Danny answered, and I said, \u0027where is my granddaughter?\u0027 I said I need to speak to Kelly. He said, \u0027she does not want anything to do with that side of the family. So what do you do?\u0027Pausing to wipe away tears, Mrs Lancaster added: \u0027When she (Amber) passed away, I did not even get to see her at the undertakers. They had to contact Kelly.\u0027I did not realise until that point just how cruel she could be. And it is cruel. That is how it is.\u0027The inquest also heard from Kelly\u0027s mother, Dianne Gillibrand.She described Amber as having a \u0027distinctive laugh\u0027 with a \u0027vibration\u0027, adding: \u0027You would hear her before she entered the room.\u0027You would see this long black hair flying around the corner, then these beautiful eyes. She had beautiful bone structure.\u0027Asked by Ms Bower what Amber enjoyed, Mrs Gillibrand said: \u0027She liked anything adrenalin-filled. She hated sitting still.\u0027Referring to Danny, Mrs Gillibrand said: \u0027Amber met him, she found him good enough. She enjoyed his company. \u0027She chose to call him \u0027dad\u0027 and the children chose to name themselves \u0027Peat\u0027.\u0027She said, \u0027he has been more of a dad to me than my own dad, and we want to become Peats\u0027. As the inquest into Peat\u0027s death in 2015 continued into it\u0027s second week, a coroner heard she stormed out of the family home after being told to \u0027wash every pot in the house\u0027.On one occasion, Peat had been woken at 1.30am and told to mop the floors, the inquest in Nottingham was told.           Kelly Peat, and step father Danny Peat appeal for missing Amber to come home - but by that time she was already deadIn yesterday\u0027s hearing, Kelly Peat showed \u0027no emotion\u0027 after the 13-year-old fled and gave \u0027rehearsed\u0027 information to police before putting Amber\u0027s disappearance down to \u0027attention-seeking\u0027, a police officer who was called to the incident said.Amber\u0027s mother and step-father Danny Peat didn\u0027t report her missing for almost eight hours after going to the supermarket and having supper. It came as the last man to see her alive told the Nottingham inquest into her death that detectives turned up at his door two days after he reported it to them.Adam Lamb said the police asked if they could walk to where he last spotted Amber at 5.20pm on May 30 2015 and she was found hanging in the hedgerow nearby.The coroner has been told the vulnerable teenager was being \u0027emotionally abused\u0027 at home and subjected to a series of draconian punishments for \u0027undesirable behaviour\u0027.On one occasion, she claimed she had been been awoken by her stepfather at 1.30am and told to mop floors as a punishment for failing to fulfil domestic chores. Amber vanished at around 5.10pm – but wasn\u0027t reported missing until 12.56am the following day, after her parents had their dinner and went shopping.Tragically  she was already dead by that point.The eighth day of the four-week inquest heard from PC Nicola Roe, who was one of the first officers to respond to the missing persons call from Kelly.She went to the family home with a colleague and was told by the 37-year-old that Amber had stormed out of the house after being asked to clean out a cool box.Asked by coroner Laurinda Bower for her observations about Kelly, PC Roe replied: \u0027She was quite matter-of-fact about how she was describing the situation.\u0027The officer said she \u0027wasn\u0027t really surprised\u0027 because \u0027people present differently\u0027, adding: \u0027She seemed tired but not particularly emotional. Not upset, maybe frustrated.\u0027She explained the background that she had gone missing previously in similar circumstances, and referred to her throwing temper tantrums and attention-seeking behaviour.\u0027PC Roe said the family \u0027seemed quite well rehearsed in giving information to the police\u0027, and \u0027the general consensus was they expected her back the next morning\u0027.She added: \u0027They said she normally came back at night and that is why they left it quite late to report it.\u0027The inquest also heard from PC Kay Yelland, who visited the family home more than 24 hours after Amber walked out in order to \u0027gain more information\u0027, and found a \u0027group of people\u0027 gathered there.          The family did not report Amber missing until they had \u0027been to Tesco and had their tea\u0027. Pictured above the missing poster which was put up once it had been reported that Amber was missing Asked by Ms Bower if the atmosphere was \u0027emotionally charged\u0027 and \u0027people were upset\u0027, PC Yelland replied: \u0027No, not really.\u0027She added the response at the property was \u0027just matter-of-fact\u0027 when quizzed by the coroner about how she\u0027d describe it.PC Yelland went on to tell the hearing about a comment Amber\u0027s stepfather, Danny Peat, made about her.She said: \u0027He told me her only hobby was reading and she had no real friends.\u0027The inquest heard Amber\u0027s disappearance was initially classed as \u0027medium\u0027 risk before later being upgraded to \u0027high\u0027 – although this wouldn\u0027t have made a \u0027material difference\u0027 to the response.Chief Inspector Christopher Sullivan said: \u0027It felt very much to me this was a teenager, albeit only just a teenager, who had pushed the boundaries beyond what they normally had, and although there was concern, medium risk was appropriate.\u0027Ms Bower then read a statement from Mansfield resident Adam Lamb who told how he saw a girl, thought to be Amber, at around 5.50pm on the day she went missing.He described how he and his wife were cleaning their cars when he spotted a young girl approach.Mr Lamb said: \u0027She was walking towards me. I was blocking the pavement and I began to move out of the way.\u0027She looked at me and smiled as if to say thanks. She was chewing on her left sleeve.\u0027I watched her approach the junction. She then walked across the junction and onto a green area. She then began hanging around the leafy area.\u0027I thought it was odd she was hanging around there on her own. I spoke to my wife briefly and moments later she was no longer there.\u0027 Mr Lamb added he thought the girl had \u0027walked off\u0027.He contacted police with the sighting the following day after his wife saw a news story about Amber\u0027s disappearance on Facebook.The inquest heard two officers went to the area – but they didn\u0027t speak to Mr Lamb and failed to spot Amber.Two days later Mr Lamb was visited by a detective, who asked him to show where he had last seen the girl.Detective Constable Karl Aram told the court how they \u0027stumbled across\u0027 a tiny gap in the \u0027very dense\u0027 hedgerow – and when he leant inside he immediately saw a girl\u0027s body.He added: \u0027She was facing me. It was immediately clear to me she was dead. She was completely motionless.\u0027The officer added he could sign no sign that a note had been left.

Following a comprehensive review with global experts, we’re announcing further changes to our approach on self-harm content.

Meghan seems to have one objective as she awaits the arrival of the latest member of the Royal family in April - a determination to correct the rumours and false stories surfacing about everything from her alleged ability to keep key staff, her ‘feud’ with the Duchess of Cambridge to her penchant for 5am emails to Palace underlings.With hormones going haywire, it’s not surprising that pregnant women can get obsessive. Meghan has the added burden of living a pretty solitary existence - its can’t be easy to be on constant show, to be shacked in a relatively small cottage waiting for your first real home together to be completed. One that will be out of London and afford a greater degree of privacy.Meghan can’t pop out for a coffee or a jog without being monitored. It’s something she hasn’t found easy, and who can blame her?Her determination to be ‘normal’- a ‘people’s princess’ if you like, is really just a fantasy which will never be a reality. When the Duchess dared to shut her own car door, security staff weren’t happy - then, we were told the reason why. At every public engagement, if there’s any kind of threat, they have to be ready to throw her swiftly into the back of her vehicle. Armed guards have a pre-determined plan for all her public appearances. Her tactic of wandering into the crowds and getting up close and personal with the public might be great for fans and good for her image, but all it needs is one stray nutter and Meghan could be in serious danger.That’s just one of the reasons why her security staff have been leaving. As for the 5am emails - why can’t she just keep them as drafts and press send at 8am? It’s less passive-aggressive.In her latest bid to convince us all that she’s normal, just like the rest of us, Meghan has apparently allowed five of her closest female friends to talk to People magazine.

I almost expected to hear the Duchess is a dab hand with a needle and takes up her own hems! She’s described as ‘very self-service’.Apparently, this paragon of modern feminism cooks for Harry every day (not too hard if you’re only eating vegetables, drinking mineral water and making vegan smoothies from kale).Samantha Markle calls out sister Meghan for \u0027bulls***\u0027 story...\u0027Please stop victimizing me, Dad\u0027: Meghan sent her estranged...The Royal pardon me! Teenager stuns Harry and Meghan as he...Share this articleThe couple do not have a butler or a chef and their cottage is described as ‘cosy’. When a friend came to stay, Meghan lit a candle in her bedroom, provided slippers and a bathrobe. When her dogs get dirty, she wipes them down herself with towels. All of the above is pretty normal behaviour, but the fact that the Duchess wants to share these intimate details of her day to day life with us is charming, but irrelevant.Fact - she wears thousands of pounds-worth of designer clothes and shoes that cost £500 a pair, teamed with handbags that are equally chic. For all the talk about ‘normality’ she is married to a member of the aristocracy, a multimillionaire, a chap who doesn’t have to get up in the morning and go to an office - and shows no sign of doing so out of choice.I applaud the couple’s determination to give something back to society, to help the under privileged, but to push their lifestyle as humdrum and normal is rather nauseating. The public are not that gullible!As for her troubled relationship with her father letting us know that she wrote him a letter asking him to stop ‘victimising’ her and revealing that he even asked her to pose for pictures with him is far too much detail.          Janet Street-Porter: \u0027Her determination to be ‘normal’- a ‘people’s princess’ if you like, is really just a fantasy which will never be a reality\u0027Even the most hardened republican surely feels sympathy for this poor young woman with such ghastly relatives. Her horrible half-sister and half brother are total idiots. He was in court this week, charged with driving under the influence and snotty half-sister Samantha was telling the press Meghan was a ‘wealthy narcissist’ suffering from ‘lie-abetes’.The final proof that Megan is determined to follow poor Diana down the path of saintly martyrdom, is the hot news that she’s become close friends with the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. According to her female pals, she has ‘a huge loving fondness’ for the leader of the Church of England. A friend says ‘we can be modern women…strong moms and strong wives, but understand that (our) relationship with God is so critical’. Pass the sickbag, I don’t think I can stomach any more of this faux-perfection.All these revelations make me feel inadequate. I just can’t measure up to this perfect example of a modern feminist. At the back of my mind, though, there lurks a big question - clearly, Meghan has dispensed with the services of a Press Officer on this occasion - and that is clear a sign of insecurity.There’s a good reason why the palace hire highly skilled PR people - it’s to say less, not more. To retain an air of mystique, not a warts and all running commentary on their lives of privilege.I imagine the Queen is appalled by the twaddle in People magazine, it runs counter to everything she believes in.Couldn’t Meghan learn to act a little bit more (dare I say it?) REGAL? Keep her mouth shut, rise above common gossip, ignore her ghastly family. Blabbing is what we expect from reality stars, not members of the poshest family in Britain. "},{"url":null,"title":"Project Runway host Nina Garcia reveals underwent double mastectomy","story":"    Announcement: Nina Garcia (above in Los Angeles last week) posted a letter on the Elle website on Thursday revealing she recently had a preventative double mastectomy          Veteran: The fashion editor will be making her return to Project Runway this month as the show is back on Bravo with Karlie Kloss and former winner Christian Siriano (l to r: Brandon Maxwell, Karlie Kloss, Christian Siriano, Garcia and Elaine Welteroth)Garcia revealed that this decision was four years in the making, beginning back in 2015 when she had genetic testing to determination if she had mutations to the BRCA genes, which increase the risks of some cancers including breast and ovarian.\u0027To my surprise, I received an envelope containing the results, stating that I did in fact have a mutation and was at high risk for breast cancer,\u0027 said Garcia.In the years since, Garcia said she stayed on top of the situation, which required her to endure a litany of tests and procedures.\u0027Throughout this time, I’ve had numerous biopsies, two lumpectomies, and countless follow-ups. I’ve been marked up, poked, pricked, and turned upside down (literally!),\u0027 said Garcia.\u0027None of the results were terrible, but there were signs—radial scars, a cluster of microcalcifications, the presence of precancerous cells—which could serve as premonitions for what might happen.\u0027Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon make no mention of the...Nxivm leader ignores his harem of sex cult acolytes in...Share this articleThere were new challenges once she decided to have the operation.\u0027One of the hardest parts of the journey leading up to the surgery has been putting on a brave face and staying present, pretending that everything is totally normal,\u0027 explained Garcia.\u0027I don’t want my boys to be afraid or my husband to be more worried than he already is. I’ve been suiting up every day, heading to the Hearst Tower—business as usual.\u0027 Garcia elected to tell only handful of people that she was having the operation, but revealed those she did share the news with provided her with an immense amount of support.One friend, who she identified as a well-respected writer who also went public when she had a preventative double mastectomy, texted: \u0027So sorry you have to endure this upcoming TEMPORARY Hades, but I will be your t*ts fairy! You WILL get through this and you’ll actually discover lots of new things—new shows, books, and people who demonstrate they are your truest friends.\u0027That same friend went on to note: \u0027I had the same instinct to be private but ultimately needed to lean on my friends and am so glad I told people because they want to help.\u0027Garcia said she then found herself reaching out to more and more people who had undergone the procedure, and as a result found herself surrounded by a supportive community of women. A number of people also voiced their support for Garcia on social media after her letter was published online.\u0027Wishing my friend and colleague @NinaGarcia the speediest of recoveries- Despite being such a shining star, she is also very private and this was hard for her to write, but she wanted to give hope to others getting a preventive double mastectomy,\u0027 wrote Joanna Coles.\u0027I ultimately decided to write this in hopes that my story might serve as comfort to at least one woman out there who is going through something similar. For that woman, I want you to know that you are not alone,\u0027 wrote Garcia to close out her letter.\u0027And while I may be having a hard time feeling brave at this very minute, I know that my sisters will be waiting for me on the other side, ready to put me back together again.\u0027Garcia had been working right up until the operation, with Elle releasing their latest issue with cover star Gigi Hadid on Wednesday.   In addition to her duties at Hearst, Garcia will also be making a return to Project Runway this season. Garcia appeared alongside the rest of the cast at the TCA Winter Press Tour in Los Angeles last week in her last public appearance before her operation.Project Runway\u0027s new season will premiere on March 14. Nina Garcia on Getting a Preventive Double Mastectomy"},{"url":null,"title":"Irishwoman sent thank card EUs Juncker explains motivation","story":"    Jean-Claude Juncker shows Leo Varadkar a card he had received - apparently from a family in Ireland thanking himJuncker and Varadkar show off ‘thank you card from Irish...Pressure mounts for EU President Donald Tusk to apologise...Why IS Theresa bothering?

Meanwhile, Roberts Bakery\u0027s packaging is recyclableThe Hovis packaging states: ‘This bag is 100 per cent recyclable.’ But the small print makes it clear what that means: ‘Recycle with bags at larger stores. Check locally.’ As Mr Ellin explains, there’s very little demand for this sort of plastic: ‘Even if the council collected them, it is unlikely they would find a market and they’d end up in waste-to-energy because the market is that bad.’ In others words, they’d be incinerated.While most loaves are plastic wrapped, Roberts Bakery’s packaging is 85 per cent recyclable paper with a transparent window made from 15 per cent recyclable film.WHISKY:NO: Laphroaig Islay Single Malt Scotch Whisky (10 Years)YES: Glemorangie Highland Single Malt Scotch Whisky  The Laphroaig comes in a cardboard tube with a metal seal, with the lid contaminating the paper. The alternative is to go for a cardboard box, as used to pack the bottle of GlenmorangieThe problem isn’t with the bottle — but its packaging.

The steak that comes in the clear pack has a tray that is ‘widely recycled’.EASTER EGGSNO: Galaxy Golden EggsYES: Maltesers  Mr Ellin says the Galaxy egg highlights the problems of mixing materials: ‘If something is made from one material that makes everything easier.’ The Maltesers packaging, on the other hand, is made of just cardboardThe Galaxy egg comes in a cardboard box inside which is a clear plastic casing to house the foil-wrapped chocolate orb. The packaging states: ‘This carton is fully recyclable and can be disposed of at your local recycling centre or placed in your domestic recycling box. To recycle the foil and the plastic insert, please ask your local recycling centre for details.’ By contrast, all the packaging for the Maltesers egg is made of cardboard and can be recycled.Mr Ellin says this highlights the problems of mixing materials: ‘If something is made from one material that makes everything easier.’DOG FOODNO: Cesar Deliciously Fresh 8 x 100g pouchesYES: Pedigree Chum 6 x cans  The problem with pouches is that they are made from multiple layers of different plastic, sometimes also with an aluminium layer. If you want to recycle, buy a canThe little white pooch on the front of the Cesar pouch looks very happy but Mr Ellin most certainly is not. ‘Pouches are horrendous,’ he says.The problem is they are made from multiple layers of different plastic, sometimes also with an aluminium layer.

On the back of the pack there’s an image of someone dropping the tube in a bin, which is where most are likely to end up. This is despite the fact that at the end of last year, Kellogg’s, which owns Pringles, announced a scheme whereby consumers can send empty ones back to a Freepost address for recycling.Mr Ellin is unimpressed, questioning how many people will do this. He believes it would be better if the company redesigned the packaging.An alternative is Walkers Stax, which come in a recyclable cardboard tube, with tear-off cardboard lid. While the tube is lined with a metallic foil, Mr Ellin says that’s a small price to pay. ‘You have to have that for food safety, but you can get rid of it in the recycling process,’ he says.READY MEALNO: Sainsbury’s Chicken KormaYES: Iceland Mumbai Street Co Angry Bird Chicken  The Sainsbury’s curry comes in a black plastic tray, which is an issue. The Iceland curry comes in a cardboard tray, though, so if that’s cleaned of residual food wasteThe Sainsbury’s curry comes in a black plastic tray.

A strong, coherent Labour alternative to this shabby, Tory Brexit is absent - it has been since this Parliament began.’ Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie, who is pushing for a second referendum, accused Mr Corbyn of ‘offering to help a Tory government enable Brexit.’ Senior EU figures also seized on Mr Corbyn’s intervention as evidence that the UK could be pushed into accepting a soft Brexit. EU president Donald Tusk twisted the knife yesterday by telling Mrs May that Jeremy Corbyn’s plan for a soft Brexit could be a ‘promising way out of the current impasse’.During tense talks in Brussels, Mr Tusk is said to have urged her to consider a cross-party compromise based around permanent membership of the customs union.An EU source confirmed Mr Tusk had suggested Mr Corbyn’s plan was a ‘promising way out of the impasse.’ Joining a customs union would breach one of Mrs May’s negotiating red lines and end the dream of striking post-Brexit trade deals.

I think that what you both found yourselves in the middle of at Davos, and what I found myself in on my book tour over the last few months, and what politicians such as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have found themselves in the middle of, is the growing challenge to a kind of bullshit narrative around wealth and poverty, access and power it’s completely wrong and fraudulent, and it’s now crashing down. There is a second narrative about how the world is getting better and better: people in India and China and elsewhere have been coming out of poverty, and the world is the best it’s ever been. Never mind the fact that we’re perhaps 50 years away from catastrophic climate change fuelled by greed. That narrative, too, has had a free ride in the press and culture, including on the left, until now. And then there is a final narrative of companies and billionaires – as long as they are doing good things, we don’t ask what else they do as long as they are giving back, we don’t ask how they made their money. It’s like a mafia deal: no questions asked.R: I agree. I think that for a very long time, politicians on both the left and the right have believed that most wealth is created at the top. The brilliant entrepreneurs, the visionaries, they are the job creators. The right says we need to give them all the freedom in the world, wealth will trickle down and everything will be all right. What Winnie pointed out very well in Davos is that most real wealth is actually created at the bottom, by the working and middle classes and at the top there is a huge amount of wealth destruction and exploitation. Entrepreneurs might use the language of entrepreneurialism and hard work, but if you really delve into their business models, you’ll find that they’re not contributing to the common good. They are destroying more than they create. Davos is a Swiss ski resort now more famous for hosting the annual four-day conference for the World Economic Forum. For participants it is a festival of networking. Getting an invitation is a sign you have made it – and\u0026nbspthe elaborate system of badges\u0026nbspreveals your place in the Davos hierarchy.For critics, “Davos man” is shorthand for the globe-trotting elite, disconnected from their home countries after spending too much time in the club-class lounge. Others just wonder if it is all\u0026nbspa big waste of time.Who is there?More than 2,500 people – business leaders, world leaders, diplomats and the odd celebrity, such as Matt Damon – will fly in for the 49th annual Davos meeting. Most delegates are men, and although the forum boasts delegates from more than 100 countries, most hail from western\u0026nbspEurope, followed by the US. Sir David Attenborough is one of the most notable attendees in 2019, while Donald Trump, Theresa May and Emmanuel Macron all pulled out at short notice to focus on more pressing issues at home.A: How did the billionaires pull this off? How is it that they conquered the realm of ideas so successfully and what do you think we need to do to win the battle of ideas in the coming years?W: I was a student in the UK when Margaret Thatcher set out to crush the unions. There was a new language at that time: the message was that if you are poor you are not working hard enough. You had to be a winner and if you were not, it was your fault. Ordinary working people were put on the defensive. But there are hardly any people now who see themselves reaching the top. The top involves a tiny number of such very rich people it’s unreal. So ordinary people are saying: “Wait a moment, we are in the majority, down here, and our lives are not like that.”R: There is a depressing finding by researchers at the LSE: in a survey of 23 western countries since the 1980s, it was discovered that, as they became more unequal, their populations actually believed more strongly that people at the top were there because they worked the hardest.A: I think in many ways the forces of plutocracy and of conservatism have been better than progressives at understanding the importance of cultivating ideas. And a big part of ideas is language. I want to give some examples of the conquest of language – words that everybody uses, not just plutocrats, but that end up doing the plutocrats’ bidding. One is “win-win”. That phrase sounds great. Who could be against win-win? But, in fact, win-win is a darkly powerful way of suggesting that the only kind of progress worth having is the kind that lets the winners win – in tandem, supposedly, with empowering others.W: Yes, we were told that globalisation was a win-win. It’s a situation where everyone is a winner and no one is a loser. In America no one even wants to say they are working class. They want to be called middle class. People feel that the right thing is to identify with the winners and that has masked many problems.A: A couple more examples. Take “thought leader”. When you were both in Davos, you were surrounded by thought leaders, who are actually people who don’t say what they truly think: they are the ones who say nice things about the powerful and keep getting invited back. Why you two made such a splash is that you refused to be thought leaders, you behaved like thinkers, which is something those people don’t expect. Another instance is “doing well by doing good”: it sounds positive but it really is about putting the people who are trying to make money in charge of changing a status quo they have no interest in changing. And then there are terms such as “social impact” and “social venture capital” and “impact investing”. They are ways of encouraging us not to use words like “power” and “justice” and “dignity”. They are an attempt to make us not speak about unions and taxes.W: I have been attending climate change negotiations since 2007 or 2008, and am always frustrated that you can not use the term “climate justice”. You can talk about “climate change”, but you cannot say it is an injustice, even though the people who are facing the worst consequences are poor people. And they are not the ones who caused it. The negotiators prefer “climate action”, and the idea that we all have to do it together, that kind of happy happy language. We don’t place the responsibility where it lies.R: I really like your point about the importance of ideas, especially on the right. People often focus on Thatcher or Ronald Reagan, but what we often forget is that this thing called neoliberalism actually started in the 1950s. Figures such as Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek gathered as part of the influential think tank the Mont Pelerin Society and, back then, these were the real radicals almost everyone else was a socialist or a social democrat. So they said to themselves we have to start developing ideas. We are the resistance now, we need to start building institutions, develop a new narrative, and wait for a moment when the current system crashes – or at least doesn’t work as well any more. This is exactly what happened during the 1970s with the oil crisis, with inflation, with strikes by workers in the west. More and more people began to think that the economic system wasn’t working. And that’s when Thatcher and Reagan came on stage with these supposedly new ideas that had in fact been developed over 30 years. When, after the financial crash of 2008, it became obvious that neoliberalism was founded on a huge amount of bullshit, the problem was that there seemed to be no alternative. The left was against a lot of things: austerity homophobia racism the establishment. But you also need to know what you are for. A few years ago I argued that we needed to have a Mont Pelerin of progressives, to start developing ideas that might seem utterly utopian now but could become a reality in the future. I didn’t expect back then to be invited to Davos, of all places, to talk about basic income, nor that I would go viral with a speech about taxes, taxes, taxes. It has been really interesting how quickly things have changed.Again, in relation to the past, there is the importance of the cold war, capitalism v communism. I’ve often thought social democrats in a way depended on there being communism further to the left. Then, with the defeat of that communism and the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the “end of history” was proclaimed, and politics was just going to become technocracy – win-win. What has been happening now is that there is a new generation that’s not traumatised by the cold war. I’ve heard this in Davos as well: you talk about taxes and some of the billionaires say, “Oh that sounds like Venezuela” – Michael Bloomberg recently said it. But now there is a new generation that says: “Whatever.”A: I’ve met more people on my book tour in the last five months than I’ve ever met before in my life. And the big thing I’ve found is that the conversation no longer revolves around capitalism v gulags. When Bill Gates was asked in Davos about my book, he seemed to insinuate that I was a communist, even though he had blurbed it a year before. I think most people now understand that this “There is no alternative” talk is bullshit. An understanding seems to be rising that it’s not about left v right or communism v capitalism any more, but about humanism v plutocracy.R: One thing I’ve been doing is to use a different kind of language, one that centres on basic income for everyone and higher taxes on the rich. Often people on the left use the language of care, or they say something is just immoral or this is unjust. And yes, there is a certain part of the population that is receptive to this kind of language. But there is another part of the population that doesn’t really like that language. Also, impoverished people never like being talked down to.One thing to do is to take back the win-win language and use it for something else. For example, doing something about poverty – there’s a lot of research that shows eradicating poverty is an investment that pays for itself. You spend less on healthcare costs, you spend less on crime, kids will do better in school, so that is a win-win policy. Also, history shows the most fundamental innovation has come about through government spending. The iPhone is a perfect example: every fundamental technology that has gone through the iPhone touchscreen, the battery, the mobile technology – it has all been invented by researchers on the government payroll. In the 1980s and 90s it became fashionable to think of the government as inherently wasteful. But new research has been conducted by two Dutch economists, who asked 27,000 people in 37 countries: do you think your job is actually valuable? It turns out a quarter think their job doesn’t add anything of value. And four times as many people think that in the private sector as in the public sector. The more valuable jobs, such as caring for other people, police officers, fire fighters, you name it, are in the public sector. It’s possible to take the whole narrative of wasteful jobs and turn it around.W: Yes, at Oxfam we call it a human economy, and we try to paint a picture of what that could look like. We begin with what is wrong now, showing that the super-rich don’t just spend on priceless works of art, but also use that money to buy the public voice, buy the media, buy impunity from justice, buy the policy process, to bribe congressmen and women. I call it bribing, they call it lobbying. We show wealth at the top is being used to take away your voice, your rights, the policies that would work for you. I find that this shocks people – they start by thinking that the rich are just enjoying their money, snorting cocaine. Then they actually realise they are using that money to disempower ordinary people. For example, we can express the amount of money governments lose from billionaires’ tax dodging in terms of the number of nurses. Supposing we said: “x-billionaire dodged some 50,000 nurses”. We use that kind of language – it’s emotive, it has an impact on people.A: In the US the right has been better at using the kind of emotive language you describe. For example, the estate tax, which in any version of it only affects a very small number of estates at the top: it was brilliantly rebranded as the death tax. If you call it a death tax you create the feeling among people that their very mortality is being interfered with by the government. People who want more equality and more justice need to get more imaginative with language.R: Here’s an idea: I think we should call it a laziness tax. That’s basically what it is. You have a huge class of people who haven’t actually done any real work themselves or contributed in any meaningful way to societies. They were just born into certain families. I’ve also been trying to reframe basic income as pro-work. It’s “venture capitalism for the people”, to use a Silicon Valley phrase. Everyone wants the ability to make different choices, to move to a different city, start a new company. I dislike the left v right axis, but you often can’t get around it.A: I was listening to an extraordinary conversation Ocasio-Cortez had with the American writer Ta‑Nehisi Coates in a church a couple of weeks ago for Martin Luther King Day. Ocasio-Cortez made the point that elected officials like her are really followers rather than leaders. She said: “Part of the job of elected public office is translating public will into the law of the land. Who shapes, who directs and who moves that public will? Writers, journalists, activists, artists.” And that is so true. It was the job of Upton Sinclair to show what the slaughterhouses were actually like, and what labouring conditions were actually like, and then politicians made laws to improve things. It has been such a grim time for journalism, for books and many of these other things, in part, because of plutocrats and the monopolistic world they have built. But I come to this conversation so optimistic about the power of ideas and books right now. I feel like what we are witnessing is a profound cultural turning point in relation to these issues, caused by activists, artists and writers who are changing what the public wants by telling honest stories.W: Stories are my biggest weapon. Oxfam works in more than 90 countries around the world, and people respond to stories very strongly.R: I’m 30 years old. I’ve been writing for seven or eight years now. And never before have I had such a strong feeling that the zeitgeist is really shifting and now you can talk about things that were simply not possible just a couple of years ago. It seems like the window of what is politically possible is just opening up, or that what they call the Overton window is shifting. Ideas, according to theory that originated with political scientist Joseph Overton, are seen as somehow acceptable to discuss at a certain creative time, and the real political challenge is to move the window. The people behind such a shift are never politicians or mainstream writers, they are the radicals – those who are often seen as naive or bizarre, people who make you uncomfortable and angry. And they often pay a high price for doing this hard work. There are many examples throughout history, whether we are talking about the fight against slavery, or women fighting for the right to vote, or the establishment of the welfare state. Ideas that were first dismissed as ridiculous or too expensive or dangerous became the bedrock of civilisation. W: I hope that’s true.R: I think that hope is exactly the right word, because I never really like the word optimism. Optimism gives you the feeling that, “Oh everything will be all right, just sit down, enjoy the ride – all the trains are good.” But hope is fundamentally different, another world is possible but not inevitable.W: Do you think the racists, the misogynists, feel that they are being pushed back or do they feel they can assert themselves and make their reality the norm?A: My view from the US, and I bet it’s true in Britain to a certain extent, is that you have two big things happening to a lot of white working-class communities. On the one hand, they have been victims of a great plutocratic theft, like everybody else over the last generation. To the extent that they feel like they can’t raise children who will have a better life than them, they can’t get the kind of education that gives them a piece of the dream, they can’t have the kind of healthcare that allows them to not think about healthcare all the time, they feel that theft.The problem is that those people also feel a second theft, which is not actually a theft, which is the rise of women and minorities, and immigrants and African Americans. In fact that’s not a theft at all, it’s a wave of rising equality it is justice. But I think we have to accept that the psychological experience of this change may also be felt as a theft. What Donald Trump did is to exploit the pain caused by the real theft, and to ert blame for it on to the non-theft. He made it all about the cultural ascendancy of others – they are the ones who stole the dream from you.And instead of encouraging people to punch up at the powerful, he encouraged them to punch out, at women and minorities and the Other. I think the political challenge for us is to go to those communities and not to pander but to speak compellingly to both of those experiences of feeling wary of the future, and to identify the real reasons why it has happened. Now, before we go, I want to see if the three of us can make a case for hope. All three of us have been pushing a certain rock up a hill, and suddenly the slope seems to be becoming more hospitable. What do you want to see happen?R: If you ask people from around the globe in what kind of country they would like to live, almost everyone says: “Somewhere like Sweden.” Much less inequality, more rights for workers, higher taxes on the rich, it doesn’t really matter whether you are asking people on the left or right, it’s pretty much the same everywhere. So there is huge potential. You only need to find a way to draw on that political energy. There was one political advertisement by Bernie Sanders, in 2016, that I really like, called Together. In it he says: “We should not allow them to define us.” The whole purpose of the campaign was to bring people together – black, white, men, women, that doesn’t matter. I think this is the very simple message that we need to keep on communicating: don’t allow them to ide us.W: We must go out and mobilise and create new norms, and say, for instance, that it’s wrong for people not to have help when they are sick, they should have free healthcare. That idea was alive after the second world war. Everyone all over the world understood and agreed that healthcare should be a right. What I’m hopeful about is there is such anger at the few who are running away with wealth and power, these monopolies, these big tech companies taking our information, not paying their taxes. So much concentration of wealth and injustice by those few at the top. That is going to help us to shift the norm back to what is good for society, a human economy that works for all, a society that cares for all, including those who may not be able to work and earn. We are now a movement building. • Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World by Anand Giridharadas is published by Allen Lane.

But there’s a way to address the fears of all the major playersWhat would prompt an academic from Germany to come up with a plan to try to end the current stalemate on the backstop – the mechanism designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland after Brexit? The answer has three parts: experience in negotiations gained during my time with a multinational company, an academic interest in Brexit since 2016 including a study in which I compared it for complexity with the first moon landing and the third is that I’m a father of two who can vividly imagine the consequences for families on both sides of the UKEU ide if these negotiations fail.My experience of business negotiations in China and Russia convinced me of how crucial trust is. Without it, any negotiation is doomed to failure. You have to put yourself in the shoes of the other side and, tough as that may be, accept that you are not always right. When we look at the deadlock between London and Brussels over the Northern Ireland backstop what we can observe after nearly two years of negotiations is the total breakdown of trust. Once you hear from both sides the words “this is a matter of principle …” you know you are very close to a showdown.London’s position on the backstop is that it has to go, and Brussels’s position is that it’s vital it stays. Consequently, what we have is a game of chicken. With one big difference: it is not a game but a real disaster waiting to happen on 29 March. The major roadblock for avoiding a no-deal Brexit is obviously the backstop. A recent poll published by Paul Goodman at Conservative Home underlines this: “A majority of party members back May’s deal – if changes can be made to the backstop.” At the same time, the EU communicates exactly the opposite: No agreement without a backstop. Or as the European commissioner Frans Timmermans stated: “Let me be extremely clear: there is no way I could live in a situation where we throw Ireland under the bus … As far as the European commission is concerned, the backstop is an essential element for showing to Ireland and to the rest of Europe that we are in this together.”The issue of the backstop has now become the emblem of “we win or you win” the victory a goal in itself. To restore lost trust would take a long time – time that we don’t have. So we should instead focus on the objectives that led to the backstop because right now it is like a car stuck in quicksand that is going to drown all its passengers. Let’s step back from the stalemate, putting our minds in reverse gear, and start from the objectives of all the parties. I will then suggest a concept that I call the (modified) shamrock proposal, since the symbolic plant has only three leaves but my plan tries to take the interests of four parties into account: the UK, Northern Ireland, the Republic of Ireland and the EU.These are the main objectives and views of the parties with respect to the backstop, as one can perceive them:• The backstop has to go. A backstop where the EU has the final say with respect to the customsborder situation in Northern Ireland is unacceptable since it would undermine the sovereignty of the UK• Preserve peace in Northern Ireland based on the Good Friday agreement• Freedom to negotiate free trade agreements after leaving the EU, which is not possible under a customs union• Preserve peace in Northern Ireland based on the Good Friday agreementRepublic of Ireland• Preserve peace in Northern Ireland based on the Good Friday agreement• Preserve peace in Northern Ireland based on the Good Friday agreement• Loyalty to the Republic of Ireland• Protect the integrity of the single marketIssues of national sovereignty are among the most sensitive political subjects anywhere. Thus, we have to appreciate that the UK can’t really live with the EU having the final decision-making power over a backstop. This goes to the very core of national sovereignty, which is one of the British government’s real red lines. At the same time, the UK needs to appreciate that Brussels and Dublin need a mechanism that protects the border-free situation and the EU single market. The tragic aspect is that they may in any case come to a joint solution within the next two years that would not require a hard border. However, since neither side trusts the other all thinking seems to lead to paralysis. My proposal tries to take the uniqueness of the Good Friday agreement into account. The agreement gives the citizens of Northern Ireland a unique right of self-determination, allowing them, whenever the majority decides it, to join the Republic of Ireland. My proposal consists of two core elements:2) Between now and 2020 two outcomes emerge: in the first, both parties, the UK and EU, have clarified their future economic and trading relationship in a way that both accept would not require a hard border. Alternatively, there is an agreement for a trade deal that requires a hard border. In this case a referendum takes place in Northern Ireland.To avoid any misunderstanding: this would not be a vote about nationality or the constitutional status of Northern Ireland but a vote on whether Northern Ireland wants to remain within the EU customs area for trade purposes (thus avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland) or whether it prefers to exit along with the rest of the UK, with a customs arrangement that requires a border. Is it feasible that a territory which is constitutionally part of one country be a member of the customs territory of another? Yes, it is and it has worked in the past. If you look up the history of the Kleinwalsertal of Austria you will find that for many years it was part of the customs territory of Germany, while never questioning the Austrian nationality of its inhabitants. The reason was quite simple because of the Alps, the valley could only be accessed from the German side. Today it is no longer necessary since Austria is part of the EU.The first advantage of such a vote is that it takes the backstop decision out of the hands of the EU and gives it to UK citizens (ie, the people of Northern Ireland), thereby addressing the valid sovereignty concern. The second advantage is time. We gain time to find a joint and mutually acceptable solution without the need for a hard border.What are the disadvantages? There would certainly be arguments against involving the citizens of Northern Ireland (eg, that such a vote could let the genie of nationality or Irish unity out of the bottle). However, the genie is already out of the bottle, and come 29 March it may become much more acute than today.And what if there was a referendum and the people of Northern Ireland voted for a hard border? First, the likelihood is not very high, given the positive effects from the Good Friday agreement. And second, consider the following: the negative near-term effects of a no-deal Brexit far outweigh the more remote risk at the end of 2020.This proposal is certainly not perfect, but when you think about it, the people of Northern Ireland already have the right to self-determination and they could exercise this right at any given point in time. Based on the above, a future vote on the border issue is an element of self-determination, a vote that may not even be necessary in 2020.But right now, it could be decisive in eliminating the backstop, avoiding a no-deal Brexit and preserving peace. • Roland Alter is a professor of risk assessment at the University of Heilbronn, Germany"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5735a70cb763e29c21ec56fae347b4120ae2236a/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f314093957e4c07635b066bb3a9c527","title":"social media child angst real life","story":"It’s tempting to look for online causes if those you love are depressed – but in many cases the problem is real lifeNothing turns a parent’s heart inside out like the unhappiness of a child, and your own helplessness in the face of it. When they were tiny, it was all so much easier. Toddlers can turn from sunny to inconsolable in a second, but are equally miraculously restored by a nap or a box of raisins. The unhappiness of an older child, however, is infinitely more frightening. Suddenly adults too are out of their depth, thrashing around for answers, terrified that there might not be any.Last week, in the middle of an emotive public debate about teenage suicides, the government’s former mental health champion for schools, Natasha Devon, listed the top things that pupils tell her are threatening their mental wellbeing. The order has probably changed over the years – I’m not sure academic anxiety would have topped the list in the 1990s – but otherwise it’s been the stuff of teenage diaries since time immemorial: problems at home, or having nobody to talk to. Striking by its absence, however, was something that increasingly worries so many parents. “Pressure from social media to live a perfect life” scraped in only at seventh on the children’s list.This week the chief medical officers issued some thoroughly sensible guidance on screen use: ditch the screens at meal times in favour of a proper conversation, and don’t let kids have mobile phones in their bedrooms keeping them awake all night. Ministers have taken an equally sensible step towards treating the biggest platforms like the publishers they have in reality become, and holding them responsible for the content they host.Change has been brewing in Whitehall for a while, but an impassioned campaign by the parents of 14-year-old Molly Russell – who say she had looked at material related to anxiety, depression, self-harm and suicide on social media before taking her own life – has surely helped shift public opinion. There will always be spaces online where anything goes, but if brands such as Instagram or Facebook want to maintain the confidence of their users then they have to do better. So far, so good.But the debate about social media and teenage mental health is getting uncomfortably reminiscent of the age-old argument about whether women’s magazines full of skinny models were making young girls anorexic, to which the answer is that basing an industry on half-starved young women is wrong on every level but eating disorders are infinitely more complicated than that.Glossy magazines were only the most visible expression of a commercial culture based on making women think there’s something wrong with them. But even blaming eating disorders on that broader culture sidelines the issue of other things that may be going on in inidual girls’ lives, or how both those factors might interact with any organic cause of mental illness. Girls who are completely happy with their bodies and lives don’t generally develop eating disorders overnight just by reading fashion spreads. Understanding this doesn’t remotely absolve fashion magazines from recognising their social responsibilities, both to readers and to models, and the changes some have made are also sensible. But they only get us so far.Research does suggest that children who spend a lot of time online are unhappier than children who don’t, but it’s still unclear which way round the cause and effect are. Are social media so toxic that they drag otherwise happy children down, or do the lonely and troubled spend longer than others seeking comfort from them? Or is the truth somewhere in the middle, with unhappy kids more likely to chase a kind of gratification that will ultimately leave them feeling worse, like adults seeking solace in a bottle? If it’s the latter, then obviously social media companies would still have a moral obligation to vulnerable users. But that would be only half the picture. The other half is asking why so many kids are vulnerable in the first place.Depression, anxiety and self-loathing don’t always come neatly packaged with an explanation or a cause. Anyone who has lost someone to suicide, meanwhile, knows that sometimes the answers we long for can’t be found. The stories that get most airtime are invariably these terrifying ones, where a loving family just can’t understand how the darkness enveloped their beloved child.But those are not the only stories. There is a darker side to teenage mental health, one for which faceless giant tech companies or exam pressure can’t be blamed but for which evidence is strong. Children who suffer two or more of what are known as adverse childhood experiences – anything from bereavement or parental separation to neglect, abuse, or a parent with addiction – are three and a half times more likely to have mental health problems when they grow up. Children raised in extreme poverty or in care, children who have witnessed domestic violence, children who for whatever reason feel ignored or overlooked or have nobody at home they can comfortably talk to, are all arguably more at risk than most. And unless their parents can afford to go private, then some may find themselves waiting up to 18 months for referrals to overstretched adolescent mental health services. As Devon put it, we have taught kids that it’s good to talk about their feelings, but sometimes that just means “children can tell you precisely what’s wrong but have nowhere to turn for support”.So by all means let’s shield kids from gruesome content, teach them self-esteem can’t be found in Instagram likes, encourage them to switch off and engage in real life. But so long as there are kids whose real life is the problem, we’ll still only see half the picture."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be5b38999d075563ccf8f7273bc3526454eee2f8/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c534a0323cfe6d2bcfe252850f230c17","title":"the best blue pieces for all ages in pictures","story":"Wearing blue can be as little, or as big, a statement as you want.

But which big-screen Shakey is the greatest?Despite its hey-nonny-nonny reputation, Shakespeare’s pastoral comedy, written during a time of immense social upheaval, has sharp edges. Or at least it does in this modern-dress version by director Christine Edzard, which makes it into a thinly veiled commentary on the inequalities of post-Thatcherite Britain. Arden becomes a cardboard city in London’s Docklands, while the “court” from which Rosalind (Emma Croft) and co are expelled is a glitzy bank. Heavy-handed but thought-provoking.It may be a little too plush and self-satisfied, but Joseph L Mankiewicz’s golden-age Hollywood version of the tragedy some Americans regard as their own has stood the test of time. Perhaps its most impressive aspect is the cast: John Gielgud, James Mason, Deborah Kerr, Louis Calhern. Marlon Brando’s blazing turn as Antony (“Lend me your ears”) is so riveting that you almost forget Roland Barthes wrote an entire essay mocking the wigs.The surprise success of Branagh’s Much Ado (see below) set off a minor Shakespearean gold rush during the mid-1990s. One movie that has dated better than most is Trevor Nunn’s Victorian country-house Twelfth Night, which captures the shadowy magic of the play well. Nunn may be a journeyman film-maker, but he’s a superlative director of actors: Imogen Stubbs and Helena Bonham-Carter have genuine chemistry as Viola and Olivia, and Nigel Hawthorne harrumphs well as Malvolio.Barely known outside India, Gulzar’s classic Hindi-language version of The Comedy of Errors is not merely the only feature movie adaptation of the play ever made – it’s a genuinely insightful one. Shakespeare’s good-natured romp about two sets of identical twins who are continually mistaken for each other is a great fit for broad-brush Bollywood comedy. Via some camera trickery, Sanjeev Kumar puts in a lugubrious, long-suffering performance as two of them.Julie Taymor’s version of this gore-filled early tragedy – hand-lopping, people being baked in a pie, plus the rest – is both stylised and stylish, somewhere between Mad Max and The Craft. Anthony Hopkins’s embattled old soldier, Titus, and Alan Cumming’s high-camp Saturninus both command attention, but Taymor deserves full credit for making the experience both horrible and appallingly funny.Not technically a movie, rather a TV recording of a stage production. But what a production: Janet Suzman’s version of Shakespeare’s tragedy of race, staged at the Market Theatre in Johannesburg during the apartheid era, caused a sensation, and with good cause. John Kani is youthful and surprisingly timorous in the lead, fatally outmanoeuvred by Richard Haines’s bullying Afrikaner Iago. Many productions strive to make the play “relevant” this one hardly needed to, and is all the more potent for it.Freer even than his avant-garde adaptation of Macbeth – see below – Akira Kurosawa’s riff on Hamlet brilliantly relocates Denmark to mid-century Tokyo and makes the angst-ridden prince into a downtrodden salaryman (Toshirô Mifune) frantic to find out who killed his father. A scathing excoriation of post-war Japanese corruption and a masterly demonstration of noir.Soon after fleeing the Nazis and arriving in the US, theatre director Max Reinhardt started work on a movie of A Midsummer Night’s Dream. It’s an odd collision of styles – German high romanticism meets Hollywood glitz – but Hal Mohr’s cinematography is astonishing, a surreal visual fantasy of dancing sprites and flying unicorns. Legend has it that the set used up some 600,000 yards of cellophane and 67 tonnes of trees.Kenneth Branagh’s devotion to putting Shakespeare on the silver screen has produced some so-so efforts (Hamlet, Love’s Labour’s Lost) as well as some genuine turnips (an inexplicably Japanese As You Like It). His earliest attempt at comedy is in some ways the best, full of sunny high spirits and still terrific fun to watch. The Tuscan setting is glorious, and Emma Thompson’s thoughtful Beatrice is more than a match for Branagh’s fusspot Benedick.The second of two masterly Shakespeare movies, Grigori Kozintsev’s Russian Lear was shot almost concurrently with Peter Brook’s version (see below). The two couldn’t be more different: where Brook’s is all harrowing domestic torment, Kozintsev goes for the wide angle, depicting how the insanity of one man (a wild-haired, shellshocked Jüri Järvet) brings an entire nation to the brink. The opening panorama – a painfully slow tracking shot of peasants trudging towards Lear’s castle – is one of the great set pieces of Shakespearean cinema.Baz Luhrmann’s high-octane version of Romeo and Juliet is still an object lesson for film-makers attempting to do Shakespeare with style. Setting the action in “Verona Beach” – a futuristic cross between Miami and Mexico City, imaginatively designed by Catherine Martin – Luhrmann captures the play’s gangland violence as well as its raw sex appeal. Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes wouldn’t make it through an RSC audition, but that’s very much the point.Taking her cue from an esoteric academic essay arguing that Hamlet was in fact a woman, the Danish star Asta Nielsen formed her own production company to get this silent version made. It’s a stunning piece, full of creeping expressionist shadow and centred in every way on Nielsen’s Prince – whip-smart, alluringly androgynous and more than a little loopy. Hisher eye-rolling at Polonius deserves its own Tumblr account.Shakespeare’s mystical late play has inspired several directors to live out wild cinematic fantasies, the wildest of which might be Fred MWilcox’s brilliantly strange sci-fi reboot, Forbidden Planet (1956). Derek Jarman’s rendering is perhaps a touch too art-school for its own good, but contains many beautiful things, among them a gruff Prospero from Heathcote Williams and a roistering turn by the performance artist Jack Birkett as Caliban. The deliciously camp finale features the jazz a Elisabeth Welch warbling Stormy Weather to a chorus of sailors. Even Shakespeare might applauded that.An Olivier that has aged well. At first glance, this mid-1950s version of the early historical thriller looks every one of its 60-plus years, down to the over-saturated Technicolor and hey-nonny-nonny musical score by William Walton. What makes it gloriously watchable, now as then, is Olivier’s effortlessly virtuosic performance as Richard: imperious, ironic, brutish, sometimes hysterical and never less than smirkingly seductive.It isn’t quite as clever as Amy Heckerling’s take on Jane Austen in Clueless, but Gil Junger’s attempt to pull a similar trick with Shakespeare – what would happen if you made a boring old set text into a high-school romcom? – is smart and sassy. A brightly contemporary retelling of The Taming of the Shrew, it features Julia Stiles as a scowling tomboy refusing to play the dating game and a shaggy Heath Ledger trying to charm her into doing just that. The sexual politics are queasy, but somehow Junger makes you smile.When Peter Brook’s production of Lear opened at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1962, with a tormented Paul Scofield as the mad king, it was acclaimed for its Beckettian sense of despair. The version they put on screen nine years later is even bleaker. Guttural and rasping, with a face resembling a tree scorched by lightning, Scofield bristles with anger, but is in the end desperately lonely. The supporting cast (including Cyril Cusack and Patrick Magee) is superb, and the setting – it was mostly shot in the barren reaches of rural Denmark – looks like warmth has never touched it.Indian cinema has a long history of imaginative Shakespeare adaptations, and this is one of the finest. A modern-day Macbeth relocated to the murky Mumbai crimeworld by director Vishal Bhardwaj, it’s like watching the Scottish play through a Francis Ford Coppola filter and city smog. The pouch-eyed Irrfan Khan is nicely shady as the hero, but the show is nearly stolen by a fire-breathing Lady Macbeth from Bollywood legend Tabu. Great tunes, too.Orson Welles’s lifelong obsession with Shakespeare was best realised in his monumental version of the Henry IV plays. Centre-stage, naturally, is Welles’s own Falstaff, far more ruthless than you would guess from his Christmas pudding-like appearance. Yet there are a feast of other fine performances: a conniving Keith Baxter as the rapscallion Prince Hal, a glacially unimpressed John Gielgud as King Henry IV, and Jeanne Moreau on ardent, impassioned form as Falstaff’s sweetheart.Forget your Oliviers and your Branaghs: the greatest cinematic Dane was Russian. As well as being the prince of Soviet actors, Innokenti Smoktunovsky was a Red Army hero who spent time in Stalin’s gulag, and his boyish, bewildered Hamlet knows only too well what it’s like to be crushed by the machine. Manoeuvring the camera around a warren of suffocating spaces, director Grigori Kozintsev makes the tragedy into a parable of power and powerlessness.Little remains of Shakespeare’s script, but in Akira Kurosawa’s masterly interpretation of Macbeth the poetry is all visual: brooding castle gates, misty battlefields, empty rooms where only the worst will happen. Reimagining the story as a samurai epic, Kurosawa pares the tragedy down to its essentials and turns it into a thrilling cinematic experience –both utterly different from the play and wholly in its spirit. In the lead, Toshirô Mifune roars and bellows like a wild beast, and as his wife Isuzu Yamada journeys from venomous malevolence to terrified insanity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/031079c32ab0548656496a7cb65037c19723ab28/502_108_3158_1896/master/3158.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=349101966560281ca2411ef639af24d2","title":"black sheep guardian film nominated for best short documentary oscar","story":"Ed Perkins’ film about a young black boy’s response to a racist gang after he moves out of London is up for an Academy awardBlack Sheep, a film commissioned by the , has been nominated for best short documentary at the 2019 Oscars.Directed by Ed Perkins, Black Sheep tells the story of Cornelius Walker, a black 11-year-old from London who moves with his family to a housing estate in Essex after the murder of schoolboy Damilola Taylor in 2000. Walker, the same age as Taylor and of similar background, found himself confronting a gang of local racists and, after first fighting back, went to extraordinary lengths to fit in and gain their friendship.The film features interviews with Walker looking back 15 years on from the events he describes, which are re-enacted in the locations where they took place, with Kai Francis Lewis playing Walker.Responding to the nomination, Walker said that he was, “humbled and proud.

However, the trip to Borehamwood to play five-time league cup winners Arsenal offered a much bigger test of how they will fare should they be promoted to the top ision. It was one in which Stoney felt they acquitted themselves well. “I’m really proud of them,” she said.“At 2-0 down they could have collapsed or gone away but they didn’t, they got stronger, they fought. We’re seven months in, we’ve got a very young team and we’ve just gone and lost 2-1 to Arsenal. It was a great test for our players tonight.”The Gunners took the opportunity to rest weary legs on Sunday at Crawley Wasps, relying on youngsters to secure their FA Cup fifth round berth, but Manchester United’s weekend trip to Brighton gave no room to rotate.However, if anything the visitors started the brighter side. A Katie Zelem free-kick slipped towards Alex Greenwood but Arsenal bodies got in the way. Two minutes later Jess Sigsworth was through on the right only for Emma Mitchell and Louise Quinn to crowd her enough to force her to shoot across goal. It was a touch of inidual class from Arsenal that broke the deadlock on 18 minutes, Dominique Bloodworth sliding a delightful ball through to Miedema, who slotted past Siobhan Chamberlain. With little left of the first half a frustrated Stoney barked “One minute or I’m subbing you” at 17-year-old Lauren James, who had raced to the dugout to have an earring removed. Playing furthest forward James was a little isolated, a mazy run across the edge of the box a glimpse of her talent before she was taken off in the second half.With heads unbowed Manchester United pushed for a leveller, but their drive forward left space at the back and on 50 minutes Beth Mead’s cross from the left was cleared to the feet of Miedema, who again made no mistake, sweeping the ball past Chamberlain.From there Arsenal took control, a Mead header stinging the crossbar before being headed clear by Millie Turner. Then Bloodworth struck from 40 yards but her effort sailed narrowly over the bar.A consolation goal with seven minutes left, Mollie Green striking low into the corner, put a spring in United’s step but it was not enough. The win means Arsenal face Manchester City on 23 February at Bramall Lane in a replay of last year’s final, which they won 1-0."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8158256d1af670d6ef412b4ab668f3f4b1b2089/175_289_4637_2783/master/4637.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b2e814aded752533bf9177ef7bce0b0","title":"liverpool world record profit 2017 18","story":"• Champions League football helped beat Leicester’s £92.5m• Reds reinvested £190m in players, including agents’ feesLiverpool broke the world record for the biggest pre-tax profit made by a football club during the 2017-18 financial year, the club’s latest accounts have revealed.Champions League qualification, progress to the final in Kiev and the £142m sale of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona were instrumental in producing a pre-tax profit of £125m, eclipsing the £92.5m made by Leicester City in 2016-17.The profit after tax was £106m and £190m was reinvested in Jürgen Klopp’s title-chasing squad, a sum that includes agents’ fees and associated costs. Money has also been invested in a £50m training complex under construction in Kirkby, and the overall wage bill increased to £263m.Turnover for the year ending 31 May 2018 increased by £90m to £455m, with media revenue rising by £66m to £220m in the second year of the three-year Premier League broadcasting deal. Commercial revenue was up £17m to £154m and match revenue increased £7m to £81m.Champions League football helped drive the increases on 2016-17, when Liverpool did not qualify for any European competition but posted a pre-tax profit of £40m, with the new main stand generating the extra match-day revenue. The outstanding loan on the main stand, provided by the owner Fenway Sports Group, is £100m with £10m in capital paid off over the year. The club’s external debt stands at £56m.Liverpool made £72m from last season’s Champions League campaign. The latest accounts include the signings of Virgil van Dijk, Mohamed Salah, Andy Robertson, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Dominic Solanke. They do not account for last summer’s club record spend on Alisson, Naby Keïta, Fabinho and Xherdan Shaqiri, signed for a combined total of £174m.Andy Hughes, Liverpool’s chief operating officer, said: “This growth and increase in revenue has enabled us to significantly reinvest both in the playing squad and the football operational infrastructure. Financial results do fluctuate depending on player trading costs and timing of payments but what’s clear in these latest results is the further strengthening of our underlying financial footing and profits being reinvested in the squad and infrastructure.“Since the reporting period, which is now nearly 12 months old, we have continued reinvesting in the playing squad from those areas of growth. In addition, the capital investment in our new training complex in Kirkby is well under way, which will provide first-class amenities for our players and staff, and will vastly improve sports facilities for the community of Kirkby.”Liverpool signed eight new sponsorship deals during the 2017-18 financial year and renewed four. Commemorative jerseys to celebrate the club’s 125th anniversary were the biggest selling in Liverpool’s history and its social media platforms attracted more than 60 million followers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11019df627899f9193d253a8b299604fd54ced7e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c1169ce153b756587c57d142972c9f8","title":"premier league 10 things to look out for this weekend","story":"Enigmatic Chelsea travel to Manchester City, Marco Silva returns to Watford, Burnley look to leapfrog Brighton, and Liverpool need Roberto Firmino to find formThe fact that Manchester City are pursuing four trophies makes each one more difficult to claim, and the effort could take a toll even on Pep Guardiola’s lavish squad. Chelsea should be able to make Sunday’s fixture one of the most demanding yet for City this season, but Maurizio Sarri’s erratic side have been so bad in recent away matches – deservedly losing at Arsenal and Bournemouth – that there is no telling what sort of outfit will turn up at the Etihad. With Gonzalo Higuaín looking sharp and Eden Hazard capable of bewildering Kyle Walker, Chelsea could, in theory, be even stronger than they were when they beat City 2-0 at Stamford Bridge in December. Mind you, City squandered several chances to take the lead that day – and this time Sergio Agüero is available. PDAt his best, Roberto Firmino is the player who makes Liverpool tick. He is the pulsing brain behind many of their devastating attacks, sometimes knitting moves together in the false nine role, or creating space for Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mané with clever movement off the ball. Salah is the team’s undoubted star after scoring 63 goals since joining Liverpool two summers ago, but the front three would not work without Firmino’s intelligent promptings. Just look at how Jurgen Klopp’s team struggled when the Brazilian had a subdued game in the tense 1-1 draw with West Ham on Monday. After being taken off with 15 minutes left at the London Stadium, Firmino needs to rediscover his zest when Liverpool host Bournemouth. JSMauricio Pochettino has a difficult balance to strike when Tottenham host Leicester on Sunday. His side are gathering powerful momentum again and are five points off top spot after scoring late winners against Fulham, Newcastle and Watford. Yet Tottenham’s squad remains light after another quiet transfer window, Harry Kane and Dele Alli are still injured and Pochettino has to think about making sure his players are fresh to face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League next Wednesday. Does the Argentinian rotate his side before the Dortmund game? Does he keep his team fresh for a crucial knockout game and rest someone like Christian Eriksen? If Pochettino feels that Danny Rose needs to be managed carefully and cannot start twice in the space of four days, which game is made for the buccaneering left-back? Do Spurs prioritise the grind of the league or the unpredictability of Europe? Or do they put it all on the line, throw caution to the wind and go for both? Fatigue be damned history is there to be made. JSMarco Silva comes back to his old Vicarage Road stomping ground with a vote of confidence from his chairman that is unlikely to be endorsed by Everton fans who have watched his team lose seven of their past 10 Premier League matches. Everton’s comic inability to defend set-pieces properly is an area likely to be targeted by Watford, who in left-back José Holebas have one of the top-flight’s best dead-ball specialists. No slouch over a stationary ball himself, the aerial threat caused by Troy Deeney – not to mention Craig Cathcart and Adrian Mariappa – is likely to cause Everton’s defenders no end of problems at free-kicks and corners on an afternoon when they desperately need a win to appease increasingly impatient fans. BGLeander Dendoncker had to wait for his chance after joining Wolves from Anderlecht last summer, but the versatile Belgian is beginning to demonstrate why he is regarded as one of the brightest young players in Europe. Nuno Espírito Santo rarely changes a winning team and the Wolves manager found it hard to find space for Dendoncker during the first half of the season. Yet the 23-year-old has impressed since making his first Premier League start in the 3-1 win over Tottenham on 29 December. Capable of playing in defence and midfield, Dendoncker has helped Wolves win their last three league games and scored his first goal for the club in last weekend’s impressive 3-1 win over Everton. He is likely to have a big role as Nuno’s team look to extend their winning sequence to four league matches when they host Newcastle on Monday. JSDays before the arrival of PSG at Old Trafford, Ole Gunnar Solskjær could be forgiven for engaging in a little rotation when he takes Manchester United to Craven Cottage for a match against a Fulham side seven points from safety and with only Huddersfield beneath them. Despite his public pronouncements and nice-guy image, Solskjær has been ruthless in banishing those players he evidently doesn’t rate to the margins. If fit peripheral figures such as Fred, Antonio Valencia, Andreas Pereira, Matteo Darmian and Scott McTominay can’t be trusted to do a job on Saturday, then they probably have no future at Manchester United. Keep your eyes peeled, too, for the lesser spotted Lazar Markovic, who could play in the Premier League for the first time since 2017 after signing for Fulham on deadline day. BGBelgians could be the order of the day for Crystal Palace, following Christian Benteke’s impressive start in the win over Fulham, coupled with Michy Batshuayi’s debut impact. It would be a sign of Roy Hodgson’s intent if he decides to select the two strikers in the absence of the suspended Wilfried Zaha. Hodgson is known for playing with the handbrake firmly on, but now he has a potentially exciting forward line at his disposal he might be keen to utilise it against West Ham, and create some breathing space above the drop zone. Attack being the best form of defence might be largely alien to Hodgson but rarely has he been permitted such talent in the final third, even if Batshuayi may be required to play out wide. Palace need points and Hodgson knows how to eke them out, but this is his chance to get them with a sledgehammer rather than reason. WUHaving come off the bench against Manchester City, a full debut against the worst team in the top flight will give January signing Denis Suárez as good an opportunity as any to show what he can bring to the Arsenal party. Despite failing to impress at Barcelona, the midfielder clearly did enough in the one season he spent playing under Unai Emery at Sevilla to convince Arsenal’s manager he has much to offer and, if he starts, it will be intriguing to see in what role. While Alexandre Lacazette and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang have forged a successful partnership and clearly enjoy playing together, Andrew Mangan of Arseblog is of the opinion Emery may rotate them “a bit more if Suárez can find his feet quickly, ensuring he doesn’t fatigue them, as well as giving us a bit more depth on the bench”. That, or given his current paucity of defenders, the Spaniard may be handed a pair of stilts and asked to do a job in the centre of defence. BGBefore Brighton travelled to Turf Moor, they were 11 points above Burnley. But their 1-0 defeat that day was the start of a slump during which they have mustered just one win from 10 league games. Burnley, meanwhile, have found form and another victory for them on Saturday would take Sean Dyche’s side to the same points tally as Chris Hughton’s, indicating that Burnley are pulling clear of trouble and Brighton are slipping into it. Glenn Murray was not fit enough to play from the start in December’s meeting, but he underlined his readiness for this game, and his continued importance to Brighton despite the promise of Florin Andone, by scoring twice in Wednesday’s FA Cup win at West Brom. If Brighton defend set-pieces better than they did in the away game, they should be able to keep Burnley at a reassuring distance below them in the table. PDCardiff City are the first Premier League side Southampton have faced twice since Ralph Hasenhüttl’s appointment, after losing 1-0 away in his first game in charge. The Austrian has turned Saints’ fortunes around, but defeat would see Neil Warnock’s side leapfrog them in the league. Hasenhüttl’s side have beaten Arsenal and drawn with Chelsea since his arrival, but victory over relegation rivals at St Mary’s will be a truer test of his side’s improvement and character. On that December day, Cardiff were well-organised, and the return fixture is a chance for Hasenhüttl to show he can break down the archetypal lower-half Premier League side as he continues his learning curve.

I think we tend to look at these things as a nice thing to do, to try and write new history for the club all the time. Winning at Anfield is something we would love to do. No team has done it for a long period of time in the Premier League which goes to show how consistent Liverpool have been.Tim Woods writes: “Liverpool ‘good at football’? Haven’t you heard the latest news? Having drawn two games, we are now officially bottlers with nerves of cotton wool, Van Dijk is a fraud and City have basically won the league due to the new rule about going back on top by goal difference. It’s all over basically and Klopp (who has never won anything) has been found out again. Please correct your blog accordingly.” Careful now Tim, such emotionally-charged missives are evidence of title-race nerves these days, so it seems. Koppites are supposed to be sat in the lotus position doing Om mantra chants to bring the title home aren’t they? Brighton manager Chris Hughton has been full of praise for Peter Crouch before his side take on Burnley at the Amex Stadium on Saturday. The 38-year-old was at Spurs when Hughton was a coach there quite some time ago now. He’s a player I knew very well in my years as a coach at Tottenham and him being a young player coming through my group. On a personal note I’m delighted to see him playing at the top level for as long as possible. He’s a good lad and you can’t play until that age unless you are dedicated to what you do. I think he’s very good for our game, I think he’s a brilliant ambassador for our game. It will be nice to see him, hopefully he doesn’t play too well against us.Nantes have announced that they will retire the No9 shirt in memory of Emiliano Sala. The club wrote on Twitter: “Because Emiliano Sala will forever be part of the legends that have written the great story of FC Nantes, the number 9 he has worn has been retired.” Here is the story on the dreadful news that 10 people have been killed after a fire broke out at Flamengo’s training ground.There is some deeply distressing news coming out of Brazil, where Reuters report that a fire at the training centre of Flamengo, in Rio, has killed 10 people and injured at least three. The Brazilian club’s training ground was redeveloped only two months ago. Liverpool aren’t just good at football you know, they’re also record-breakers at making a pre-tax profit:Liverpool broke the world record for the biggest pre-tax profit made by a football club during the 2017-18 financial year, the club’s latest accounts have revealed. Champions League qualification, progress to the final in Kiev and the £142m sale of Philippe Coutinho to Barcelona were instrumental in producing a pre-tax profit of £125m, eclipsing the £92.5m made by Leicester City in 2016-17.You can read more on that story here: Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s transformative powers at Manchester United can, incredibly, lift the club back into the top four on Saturday. With Chelsea playing on Sunday, if United beat Fulham at Craven Cottage in Saturday’s early kick-off, they will move a point above Chelsea. Solskjær has been speaking this morning about his good work and the future of the club. A little nudge, perhaps, in Ed Woodward’s ribs to remind him that he would be prepared to stick around for a while longer: Every day I feel that I do help the club and put my stamp on it. But decisions sometimes on the future of players are not down to me. It’s the players, do they want to stay or move on but we have a vision and picture of how we want to look in a few years. We have to think long term and also short term and I’ve got a picture of what this Manchester United team should look like in a couple of years. I put my views to Ed and the club. I’ve supported and followed United for many years and I did have a clear view on what I thought my opinion would be. You get a different view on players but we’re not too far away from when I came.One player who has committed his future to the club is Phil Jones. The defender has signed a new deal until at least 2023. Jones has featured in every match since Solskjær’s arrival and the caretaker manager sees the defender as a key force within the group. Solskjær said:Phil knows what it takes to be a Manchester United player, he has won the Premier League, FA Cup and Europa League and is now one of the senior players within the team. He is coming up to his 27th birthday and entering into his prime years as a centre half. We are delighted Phil has committed his future to the club.Last week Anthony Martial signed a new contract until at least 2024, while Chris Smalling, Luke Shaw and Scott McTominay all agreed new deals earlier this season. The Premier League title race has heated up in the past fortnight, with Liverpool’s 1-1 draws against Leicester and West Ham giving Manchester City the chance to knock them off top spot with their 2-0 midweek victory over Everton. But Jürgen Klopp’s side can leapfrog City again if they beat Bournemouth at home tomorrow, meaning Pep Guardiola’s side, who have played a game more than Liverpool, will have to beat Chelsea at the Etihad to snatch top spot away again on Sunday. It’s a huge game – let’s not forget that Chelsea were the first team to beat City in the league this season. Meanwhile, Spurs, who have slowly crept up to within five points of City, play Leicester at Wembley. The Foxes are a dangerous opponent for teams at the top, having beaten City at home and drawn with Liverpool away. They generally raise their game against the top six. For a full rundown of what to look out for in the Premier League this season, have a read of this: Welcome to the Friday football blog. First to the desperately sad news that Emiliano Sala’s body has been recovered from the plane that came down in the Channel on 21 January that was taking the player from Nantes to his new club Cardiff City. “The body brought to Portland port has been formally identified by HM coroner for Dorset as that of professional footballer Emiliano Sala,” Dorset police said. “The families of Mr Sala and the pilot David Ibbotson have been updated with this news and will continue to be supported by specially trained family liaison officers.”Around the world tributes have been paid to Sala and in France, where the striker made a name for himself with Nantes, all Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 games will be marked with a minute’s applause for the player. The Ligue de Football Professionnel said: “Emiliano Sala has left the memory of an endearing man and a hard-working forward in all the clubs where he has evolved.”Cardiff City said: “We offer our most heartfelt sympathies and condolences to the family of Emiliano. He and David will forever remain in our thoughts.”In Argentina, Sala’s home nation, president Mauricio Macri, who had joined calls for the search for the pair to be resumed after it was called off, sent his condolences to Sala’s family on Twitter, saying: “We are with you,” while Diego Maradona said: “I am very sorry about this sad news. Many of us kept a glimmer of hope for you, Emiliano.” Gabriel Batistuta tweeted: ““What sadness, this is the worst news. Rest in peace warrior.”David Mearns, the shipwreck expert who led a private search for the plane, tweeted: “Rest in peace Emiliano. I was glad to provide some small comfort to … the whole Sala family during the past two weeks, but my heart goes out to the family and friends of David Ibbotson, whose loss is the same.”Fifa said in a statement: “Fifa and the whole football community are deeply saddened about the death of Emiliano Sala. Fifa and its president Gianni Infantino would like to extend their sincerest condolences to his friends and family. Our thoughts are also with the family of pilot David Ibbotson.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d11ee38ee84ad28b3dc35fa8d6e38ab770a3af02/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8a015dddd4a1fb8fd098722a2ae1940","title":"10 of the best fitness trackers to buy","story":"From sleep to smart notifications, fitness trackers do much more than just count your daily steps.

I immediately knew I had to start climbing. It’s not the reaction most people have to that film, because almost everyone dies maybe I just needed more adventure in my life. But six months later, I climbed my first mountain, Mount Whitney in California – the highest in mainland America, at 4,421 metres.In the summer of 2017, I decided to climb the highest peak in every European country – officially 49 mountains – in one year. Only a handful of people had done it before. Growing up in Sweden, my father encouraged me to be outdoors all the time, but I wasn’t a serious adventurer. I wanted to see if someone ordinary like me could climb mountains. I wanted to be a role model for girls and to tell a story that had never been told. All the stories you hear are so hardcore, of people lost on Everest or K2.There is no universal definition of a mountain. In Holland, Belgium and Denmark, the highest peak is really just a small hill. You could park your car on the top. It felt a bit like cheating, but I decided I would climb them regardless. I didn’t do any preparation for the first mountain, which was Mount Elbrus in Russia, Europe’s highest at 5,642m. It was exhausting, but I thought I would get fit climbing the rest, and I did. I made an itinerary, starting in Switzerland, where I would climb Dufourspitze (4,634m), but a snowstorm made me cancel. So I went to Spain instead. After that, I planned around the weather. I did two big mountain tours in a car all over Europe and the rest I did on weekends.Climbing mountains is an experience that is hard to put into words. You are in a beautiful environment and, when you reach the top, you feel incredible. But also you have to climb down, which is when most accidents happen – people are tired, it gets dark, it’s harder. I don’t climb mountains that I am not totally ready for. I wouldn’t climb K2 tomorrow, but each one I climb takes me to the next step.I don’t have many friends who like to climb, and sometimes you want to have someone to share the experience with. I work as a fashion photographer and most of my friends won’t even come to the climbing gym in case they ruin their nails. So I’ve used Instagram to find people, and sometimes even Tinder if they had a climbing photo in their profile, I would swipe right.I had a few moments that were sketchy, but not super scary I never feared for my life or got injured. I skied up and down Norway’s highest mountain, Galdhøpiggen (2,469m), and my boots were so uncomfortable. A few days later, I went to Iceland’s Hvannadalshnúkur (2,110m) my blisters became infected, so my guide cut them out with a knife. I had 14 plasters on each foot and got even more blisters.I wanted to end the project at home, on Sweden’s Kebnekaise (2,097m). It has two peaks: the north is rocky and the south, which was always the higher one, is glacial. But with climate change, the south peak has been melting, and two days after I climbed it, the north became the higher summit. I climbed both with my camera assistant. I was wearing a superhero suit. Once I was at the top we did a shoot – it was like a day on the job it didn’t feel as special as I’d hoped. But when I put it on Instagram and people started congratulating me, I felt proud.I spent about €50,000, which is double what I had planned, and I eventually climbed 61 mountains in Europe. In the UK, I climbed the highest mountains in England, Scotland, Wales, the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland, Guernsey and Jersey. In Kosovo, there are two mountains and no one knows which is higher, so I climbed both. I also climbed four in Peru, and one in Argentina, just for fun.You have to work on your weak sides while climbing. I don’t like not being in control, but you cannot control anything on a mountain – the weather, the circumstances. It’s made me a better person. If you’re on a mountain for hours, alone with your thoughts, it’s like meditation. It makes you so much stronger, physically and mentally.My goal now is always to have a mountain in my calendar. I will climb Everest one day, when I’m ready for it.• As told to Hanna HanraDo you have an experience to share?

Our kidneys produce less urine, our body temperature is lower and our immune systems are less capable of fighting off foreign invaders at night. During the day, blood pressure rises, hunger hormones kick in and our brains shift into a higher gear. These daily fluctuations in our biology are called circadian rhythms, and they dictate when we feel sleepy.For most of human history, we slept at night and were more active during the day. Some historic accounts (Roger Ekirch) suggest that our ancestors split the night into two sleep shifts, with a period of restful wakefulness in between. However, this may not have been a universal human trait: studies of traditional societies, such as tribes in Africa and South America, and the Old Order Amish in North America (who live without electricity) suggest that many of these societies sleep in a single chunk – like most people in the modern world.In 1879, Thomas Edison flicked a light switch, and our relationship with night and day changed for ever. His incandescent lightbulbs brought cheap electric lighting to the masses, enabling us to extend the day. But this also changed the way we sleep. Exposure to light at night makes us more owlish, so we feel sleepy later. Light also has a direct alerting effect on the brain, meaning we find it harder to sleep.The transition to gas and then electric lighting also made shift work easier: no longer did factory workers have to toil under weak candlelight. Working at night means being awake, active and eating during the biological night – and then trying to sleep when the body is in day-mode. People who work night shifts are estimated to lose between one and four hours of sleep per day, which has short-term effects on emotional stability, memory, reasoning, reaction speeds and hand–eye coordination. Chronic sleep deprivation also precedes the onset of Alzheimer’s disease, cancer and various psychiatric illnesses, and is also associated with heart disease, obesity and diabetes. Similar links have been made to disrupted circadian rhythms, another consequence of shift work. If you are eating and active during the biological night, the circadian clocks in your various organs and tissues become desynchronised, meaning they no longer work as efficiently.American travel writer Horace Sutton is credited with the first reference to jet lag, in the Los Angeles Times in 1966. The most obvious symptom of the condition is feeling tired at the wrong time of day, but jet lag can also trigger mood changes and constipation. This is because besides the circadian clock that governs sleep timing, there are also clocks in our brain cells and digestive organs, which must also adjust.To overcome jet lag, we’re often told to start living on the time zone of our destination as soon as we arrive, but this can be detrimental. Say you’re travelling from New York to London – which requires your body clock to advance by five hours. If you take an overnight flight and arrive at Heathrow at 8am, it will be 3am according to your body clock – and exposure to daylight at this time is the opposite of what you want to achieve. In this situation, it would be advisable to wear sunglasses until about 11am (6am, according to your body clock).It is only in the past two decades that the biological mechanism by which light affects the timing of our internal clocks has been explained. We now know that at the back of the eye there is a subset of light-sensitive cells, which connect to a small patch of brain tissue called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). They also link to areas of the brain that regulate mood and alertness. The SCN is the biological equivalent of the Greenwich meridian: it is the reference point used by the billions of other cellular clocks in your body to remain accurate. When light penetrates the eye, it acts like the reset button on a stopwatch: it tweaks the precise timing of the SCN, ensuring it remains aligned with the rising and setting of the sun.The spread of tablets and smartphones has undermined our relationship with the night still further. Light-sensitive cells in the back of the eye are particularly sensitive to blue wavelengths of light, which predominate in electronic screens. Standard LED bulbs also emit large amounts of blue light, even though they appear bright white. Recognising the impact that this light might be having on our sleep, the American Medical Association recently issued guidance on LED streetlights. They are being rolled out because they are more energy efficient than older lights – but their effect on people’s circadian system is also five times greater. The AMA advises communities to avoid standard blue-white LED streetlights and opt for warmer coloured ones – these should also be dimmable. It’s advice we should also adopt in our homes if we want to improve our sleep: once the sun sets, keep lighting warm and dim. You should also install an app or alter the settings on smartphones and computer screens to dim and filter out blue light after dusk.Many different-coloured LEDs can be joined together to vary the shade of the light they produce, enabling the colour and intensity of a lighting system to be adjusted according to the time of day. Already, some workplaces, hospitals, and care homes are installing such “circadian” or “human-centric” lighting systems, to try to boost daytime productivity and improve people’s sleep, with promising results. The biggest challenge is getting more light into people’s eyeballs during the daytime. But there’s a simple solution: even on an overcast winter’s day, it is at least 10 times brighter outside than in a standard office – by walking to work and getting outdoors at lunchtime, we can begin to reconnect with the light cycle we evolved under. There’s even evidence that daylight exposure will improve your sleep.• Linda Geddes is the author of Chasing the Sun: the New Science of Sunlight and How It Shapes Our Bodies and Minds, published by ProfileWellcome"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4076a12e5eedd400f4bdb43e4245746e9ab43cdd/62_425_5477_3286/master/5477.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a94923dbc33accca76be2b717503ba19","title":"international garden photographer of the year in pictures","story":"The international garden photographer of the year competition specialises in garden, plant, flower and botanical photography.

Despite the site’s relatively high profile, its parent company recorded revenues of £396,000 and a profit before tax of £135,000 in the last financial year, showing the tight budgets in ad-supported online publishing.The site, which has two full-time members of staff and relies on a pool of freelance writers, will become part of Digitalbox, which also owns the website Entertainment Daily. The combined business is intending to list on the Aim stock market next month and then acquire other digital publishers.In a decidedly un-Daily Mash statement to the stock market, the new parent company said the site was “capable of consistently generating high-quality, original humour content which is extremely hard to replicate” and “has increasingly turned its attention to satirising social tribes and trends to produce highly viral content of a more timeless nature that has a much broader and longer appeal than daily news”.The Daily Mash attracted 1.8 million visitors a month, the vast majority of them in the UK and most of them coming from social media referrals from the likes of Facebook.Rafferty, the Daily Mash’s editor-in-chief, said: “This is a great opportunity for the Mash to build on what we have created so far. My co-founder, Paul Stokes, did an incredible job building a profitable business from the ground up.”The site has occasionally spread confusion, notably when Sky News inadvertently read out a spoof Daily Mash headline claiming the former London mayor Ken Livingstone had a pet newt called Adolf, at the height of claims about antisemitism in the Labour party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77d21858689d10526c45958e9ec286e3f5106497/216_119_2202_1321/master/2202.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8600b0b467ae3d3d7089829d73a68414","title":"ariana grande to grammys producer youre lying about me","story":"Singer has responded to a claim that her absence from show was due to it being ‘too late’ for her to pull something togetherAriana Grande has called out Grammys producer Ken Ehrlich for lying about the reasons behind her absence from this weekend’s awards.Ehrlich had told the Associated Press that Grande was in talks to perform at the Grammys on Sunday, but ultimately “felt it was too late for her to pull something together”.Grande has publicly disputed that lack of time was the deciding factor, tweeting, “I’ve kept my mouth shut, but now you’re lying about me.”“i can pull together a performance over night and you know that, Ken,” she continued. “it was when my creativity \u0026amp self expression was stifled by you, that i decided not to attend. i hope the show is exactly what you want it to be and more.”The singer went further, claiming that she “offered 3 different songs. it’s about collaboration. it’s about feeling supported. it’s about art and honesty. not politics. not doing favors or playing games. it’s just a game y’all.. and i’m sorry but that’s not what music is to me.”Grande is up for two awards on Sunday: best pop solo performance for God Is A Woman, and best pop vocal album for Sweetener. She’s not expected to attend the ceremony, though she tweeted that she is “still grateful for the acknowledgement this year”.Her absence will be a blow for the Grammys, which has featured her in advertising – Grande tweeted that she “passed a Grammys bus with my face on it” – for a show whose ratings fell to an all-time low last year.The dissenting tweets come on the heels of a Variety report that Grande felt “insulted” when Grammys producers wouldn’t allow her to perform 7 Rings, the chart-topping single from her album thank u, next, which drops on Friday, two days before the telecast. Producers allegedly agreed to 7 Rings only if performed as part of a medley, but Grande backed out when they insisted on choosing the second song. Variety’s source claimed that no other performer met these demands.A similar problem occurred last year when multiple-nominee Lorde reportedly refused to perform after only being offered a spot in a Tom Petty tribute instead of a solo sequence. At the time, Ehrlich claimed: “We have a box and it gets full. She had a great album. There’s no way we can really deal with everybody.”Grande remains one of the biggest pop stars in the world, with 144 million Instagram followers and 60 million on Twitter. When 7 Rings was released last month, it broke the Spotify record for most plays in a 24-hour period with 15m streams.This year’s ceremony will see performances from Lady Gaga, Miley Cyrus and Diana Ross with nominations led by Kendrick Lamar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7035d9e58bebf4ff9c48929392c800fab10f0c6a/0_603_4614_2768/master/4614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=915a27ac59df6030ed2a17badbca20d3","title":"brandi carlile grammys country gay marriage cancun","story":"This year’s most-nominated woman on Sunday’s awards show, marrying her wife illegally and her all-female festival Eight days before the 61st Grammy awards, the woman with the most nominations is on a beach in Mexico having a massage.Brandi Carlile is here in Cancún with her wife and kids – Evangeline, four, and Elijah, one – to organise and perform at the inaugural year of her all-female festival, Girls Just Wanna. But right now she is having a break from it all and reflecting on the fact that her sixth album, By The Way, I Forgive You, has gleaned six nominations, including in the three biggest categories of song, album and record of the year. Last year, the Grammys’ dearth of female winners came under scrutiny, and former president Neil Portnow declared that it was the women who needed to “step up”. The success of the pragmatic and political Carlile feels like the perfect rebuff.At 37, deep into a 15-year career as a singer-songwriter of pop-rock, blues and folk, Carlile has a serene perspective on the Grammys. “I know I wouldn’t have been ready for this in my early 30s. I would have got stressed out, not slept, got sick, drunk too much. I would have gone wrong, you know? I know what it feels like to not have recognition. It doesn’t feel bad. But this feels a lot better.”Carlile has never couched herself as staunchly country, yet this is her widest crossover to date. She had spent years writing introspectively as a lesbian with a nuanced outlook on love and struggle, a gay woman who was illegally married in 2012 before the abolition of the Defense of Marriage Act in 2015. Following Trump’s election, she understood that this was a revolutionary act. “I realised I was waking up every day political, as a gay mother with two daughters,” she says. “Being political doesn’t come from outside me any more. It comes from who I am.”Her empowerment anthem The Joke is up for song of the year. It is for effeminate boys born into an era of hyper-masculinity, and for little girls unable to see themselves represented on the biggest stages. But for Carlile its meaning is ever-changing. The second verse was written about Syria (“They come to kick dirt in your face, to call you weak and then displace you after carrying your baby on your back across the desert”), and yet, less than a year later, she says: “It’s about our own southern border. When I sing it, that’s what I’m thinking of.”Carlile was born “very poor” in a little town outside Seattle to parents who married young. After moving house every year, her dad was laid off and relocated the family to a white trailer “up half a mile of dirt road”. Her father died of motor neurone disease, and her mother, aged 30, and with a newfound carpe diem vigour, bought a PA system to start a band with the money he had left. If Carlile and her two siblings did their chores, they could sing at band rehearsals. “I was addicted,” says Carlile of music. “I’d write down lyrics and obsess about the people that sang them.”She studied Tanya Tucker and Patsy Cline and started performing onstage by the age of eight. “Most of the time I ran around the woods. The rest of the time I practised country music and flunked out of school. Even elementary.”Her entire family dropped out of high school. As school punishment for troublemaking, Carlile and her brother washed buses. One day the church got hold of them and Carlile began studying with a pastor. Around the same time, she decided to come out – Ellen DeGeneres had just done so and the 14-year-old Carlile followed suit. “I was out of the closet in school. Totally content to be out,” she says. The pastor wasn’t as relaxed, and refused to baptise her. “I had my swimsuit on under my clothes, they’d invited my family and friends – everyone,” she recalls. “That’s when they decided to make an example of me. I’d been on a lot of stages in my life, but that was an irreversibly damaging public humiliation.”When writing her album, she realised it was a moment she hadn’t processed, hence the title: By The Way, I Forgive You. Carlile reckons the US could use some forgiveness. “We have to move beyond our resentment so that we can be productive.”Her songwriting is brazenly honest: take the single, Party of One, which documents Carlile’s marital woes after her firstborn’s birth. Evangeline is biologically related to Carlile but was carried by her wife. “It was a strange setting-in of conflicting instincts: the birth mother having to win, me having to understand that I’m also a mother and not a father, but there not being a template. I was wondering if I was worthy of motherhood, whether maybe we aren’t supposed to do these things.” Not only did she confront her own “internalised homophobia” in songwriting, she wrote from a “super queer perspective” and wound up with something universally resonating. Straight couples tell her how much that song means to them.She now has a collaborator in Sam Smith, a longstanding fan in Barack Obama, and a confidant in Elton John. With increased notoriety, she appreciates it might be harder to be outspoken, particularly in the country markets, but she sees no choice. I mention a recent interview I conducted for this paper with the singer Miranda Lambert – a “dear friend” of Carlile’s and a National Rifle Association supporter – who dodged political questions. “It’s irresponsible for country music not to address sensible gun reform,” says Carlile, having just written a yet-to-be-released song titled Cowgirls with the lyric: “The NRA can kiss my country ass.” “Because they can!” she says. “I’m not afraid to say that. I’m not afraid of who it alienates.The idea for the Cancún festival she has organised stemmed from a wakeup call she had five years ago. “I never saw progress going backwards,” says Carlile, who grew up attending Lilith Fair – the groundbreaking women-centric 90s festival. Carlile played a winter cruise ship – Cayamo – and a group of attendees complained about the number of women and gay people. “They called it Gayamo,” she cackles. “Gotta hand it to them, that’s pretty funny, but it was the first time I realised that people categorise entertainment according to gender and sexual orientation. Man, that ain’t cool.”Does she want to win? “Oh my God!” she says, as though the thought actually hasn’t crossed her mind. “I don’t know if it’s about wanting to win. I fucking care so much about the nominations. I’m never going to be one of those people who plays it off. I wanna wear the right clothes, I wanna have a great time, I wanna drink champagne. I don’t know if I’m gonna win. I don’t know if I wanna win. But I know that I don’t wanna let anyone down.” Her smile starts to look a little pained, a smidgen sad. “I just don’t wanna feel embarrassed,” she says. “I hate feeling embarrassed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bceb6220df7c458823d730e8bc053f30c712a541/153_116_3260_1957/master/3260.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f143ea26ae410d9f998a06a512d129b6","title":"is the eu ready for a no deal brexit podcast","story":"Unless an agreement can be reached in the coming weeks, Britain will crash out of the European Union without a deal.

MPs are expected to submit fresh motions for votes this week when the government gives another statement on the progress of the Brexit negotiations.However, the action is also being planned in the constituencies of some MPs who have so far not rebelled on Brexit votes – including Wigan’s Lisa Nandy and Rotherham’s Sarah Champion.Another Europe is Possible, one of the key groups behind the push to get a second referendum debated at party conference, said it plans street stalls, leafleting and door-knocking in local areas – many of them heavily pro-leave constituencies – to put pressure on MPs.Local members will be urged to submit a new emergency motion to their local parties (CLPs), demanding their MPs vote down any measure that backs May’s deal.The two sentence motion, which has already been submitted for debate in a number of CLPs, reads: “It is essential that you, as our MP, vote against any Tory Brexit deal in the House of Commons and for amendments which prevent a no-deal Brexit. You must vote against to defend us from the damage that such a deal would inflict on our community.”Organiser Alena Ivanova, a Momentum activist in Jim Fitzpatrick’s Poplar and Limehouse constituency, said: “Voting down the Tory deal is a huge opportunity for Labour. Whether you want an election or a referendum – or, like most Labour members, both – this is our chance to force the political agenda and kick the Tories out.“Labour MPs need to understand the depth of feeling in their local communities and parties. It’s self-indulgent and irresponsible for MPs to prop up Theresa May. This is a moment of reckoning.”Another organiser, Gordon Watson, the deputy leader of Rotherham council, said: “A lot of party activists have respect for their MP, they work with them all the time. But this is a serious issue.“Failing to vote for good amendments could result in no deal, and that’s a catastrophe. Failing to vote against the Tory deal is essentially propping up a government that is wrecking our communities. People are running out of patience. The rebels could end up facing selection battles.”MPs reacted angrily to the threats from activists. Gareth Snell, the MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, told the : “If there are activists in the Labour movement who have got time to make phone calls to my constituents, then they can come and phone bank in my constituency to help us win back Stoke-on-Trent city council and elect Labour councillors in the local elections in May.”Onn said she had regular “full and frank conversations” at her monthly meetings with members in her Grimsby constituency. “Just last week we discussed my position opposing a second referendum, my abstention on the amendment to extend article 50 and Labour’s approach to Brexit for over two hours,” she said.“We are all disappointed to have been put in this position, which comes as a result of a reckless gamble by David Cameron purely to keep his own party together, but recognise there was a referendum that Labour pledged to respect the outcome of.”Austin said he had made a promise to his Dudley constituents to respect the result of the referendum. “Threatening to deselect good, hard-working MPs who listen to local people and keep the party’s manifesto promises isn’t going to help anyone,” he said.“I have consistently voted against leaving with no deal as this would hit jobs in manufacturing, but our manifesto gave a clear promise to uphold the result of the referendum. I respect the people I represent and I don’t think manifesto promises like that can be discounted lightly.”Austin added: “I’m worried about the economic impact of Brexit but I am also worried about the impact on trust in our democracy if we do not keep the promise we made to uphold the result of the referendum.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be8e2fee51ccd6192796e9329cc3b523e72d771e/0_219_4620_2772/master/4620.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2f3c8dcf7922523233a210abf8057349","title":"countdown to brexit key dates uk eu exit approaches","story":"With 50 days remaining, here are some of the deadlines and events that will be coming upWith 50 days remaining until Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on 29 March, the two sides have agreed to continue exploring possible tweaks to the Brexit deal that might get it over the line in the House of Commons, while still respecting the EU27’s guidelines.So far, neither looks set to budge. Meanwhile, the clock is ticking for Westminster, Brussels and businesses. Here are some of the key dates and deadlines as Brexit finally gets real.8 February: possible export problems. From this week, freighters setting sail from UK ports with cargo for far-flung destinations such as Australia and New Zealand, a journey of about 50 days, risk arriving after Brexit day with – in the event of a no-deal Brexit – no idea of the trade rules that will be in place.14 February: Brexit debate in the Commons. This is most likely to be a general debate following a prime ministerial statement, because Theresa May will almost certainly not have a revised deal by then. But amendments to the motion could lead to “indicative votes” on Brexit options or an extension of the two-year article 50 process, possibly via a relaunched Yvette Cooper-Nick Boles amendment setting a deadline for MPs to back the agreement.14 February: first statutory instrument deadline. According to the Institute for Government, this is the final day on which about half the secondary legislation needed to import EU laws can be introduced, because parliament must be given 40 sitting days to object to it. EU-related SIs can be passed more quickly in “urgent circumstances”, but still need to be approved by both houses within a 28-day window.17 February: more trade woes. From this date, ships setting sail for Japan from the UK and vice versa could arrive to find themselves in the middle of no-deal tariff mayhem.20 February: international treaty ratification deadline. About 80 of roughly 100 international treaties with other countries remain to be ratified by parliament, a process that – barring “exceptional cases” – requires 21 sitting days.28 February: self-imposed deadline agreed by May and the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, to discuss progress made by the two sides towards a revised deal the prime minister can bring back to the Commons.Early-mid March: second “meaningful vote”. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 obliges the British parliament to hold a vote on the withdrawal agreement before the European parliament has its say.21-22 March: article 50 extension request? With barely a week to go before Brexit day, EU leaders gather for their annual spring summit. This is when some EU officials think the UK might ask for more time to conclude Brexit by requesting an extension to article 50. This would need to be agreed unanimously by the EU27 and there is no time limit for it to do so – it could happen very late.By 28 March: UK ratification of extension? If Britain has asked for an extension and the EU27 has granted it, both houses of parliament must vote to allow the legally binding exit date of 29 March to be changed.Mid-late March: UK ratification of deal. If MPs eventually back May’s deal without an article 50 extension, the government still has to get the bill through both houses. Primary legislation of this sort can be rushed through quickly, perhaps with controversial elements stripped out. But an avalanche of amendments could still make the 29 March departure date unattainable.25-28 March: EU ratification. If there has been no extension, the European parliament’s second Strasbourg meeting would be the last chance for MEPs to vote through the withdrawal agreement to get it agreed before Brexit day. EU ambassadors would then have a few dozen hours to rubber-stamp the final deal.29 March: Brexit day? Without an extension, the UK will formally leave the EU on 29 March at 11pm UK time (midnight in Brussels). EU officials think a last-minute plea for more time by the UK would be unlikely, as by this late hour, events would have their own momentum. Equally unlikely, they believe, is the possibility of Britain cancelling Brexit – although the European court of justice set no notice period when it ruled the UK could unilaterally revoke article 50, so in theory, the government could still make a U-turn even at this stage.15-18 April: EU ratification following an extension. If the UK has been granted a short technical extension to complete the Brexit process, MEPs’ monthly plenary meeting in Strasbourg would be the final opportunity for the European parliament to ratify the agreement before European elections.23-26 May: European elections. If the UK sought and obtained an extension to article 50 that went beyond 2 July – the first day of the new parliament – it would have to take part in those elections, EU officials have said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8eb7e3973e7a94c0c37e5406d8099b6cda66300/266_307_3950_2369/master/3950.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e9839f08e68dead6989738aadb80ee31","title":"end uncertainty over no deal brexit says ex civil service chief lord kerslake","story":"Bob Kerslake calls for fresh referendum on Britain’s membership of the EUBob Kerslake, a former head of the civil service, has urged the government to rule out a no-deal Brexit, saying ministers had the power to do so and thereby end the uncertainty that is gripping business and local government services.He said councils and the police were being forced to ert their time towards making preparations for how to handle potential public disorder.Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Lord Kerslake also called for a fresh referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU, which he admitted might take as long as a year to organise.He denied this would in itself prolong the uncertainty, saying parliament had no alternative on the basis that MPs did not support leaving the EU without a deal and there was no majority in the House of Commons for any single form of Brexit.“Where else do we go?” Kerslake asked. “A huge amount of quite unnecessary fear is being created among the public … The government can stop this now.”In a foreword to a People’s Vote campaign paper, the Labour peer also claimed diplomats would take years to negotiate Britain’s future relationship with the European Union, and accused Theresa May of preparing for a “blindfold Brexit” in which the substantive issues about the UK’s future had not been confronted.“On the central question of Brexit – how closely the UK will align with the EU on customs and rules – the political declaration merely says that there are ‘a spectrum of different outcomes’. That the country is being asked to embrace this uncertainty, or risk the disaster of a no-deal outcome, is extraordinary,” he wrote.“We should not leave until and unless we know where we are going. If we do, the only certainty is that the resources, energy and talent of our country will be consumed by Brexit for many more years to come. The nightmare will not end. It will simply take on another form.“I know and understand why there are many people who say we should just get it over with because they desperately want this endless debate to end. They want to get back to discussing the other big issues that matter to our country, such as health, housing and the environment. But a blindfold Brexit that offers no clarity can never provide closure.”The People’s Vote paper said a vast array of issues such as frictionless trade, access to services to the single market, employment rights, human rights, migration, a future security relationship with the EU, as well as links between the UK and EU foreign policy, have yet to be negotiated in any substance, ensuring Europe will continue to dominate debate in British politics for years to come.The People’s Vote campaign has taken a battering in recent weeks, partly because of the Labour leadership’s reluctance to make a second referendum part of its campaign position, emphasising instead the deals it is prepared to back to bring Brexit over the line.The failure of MPs a fortnight ago to support a motion delaying Brexit for as long as nine months also showed the fissures inside the parliamentary Labour party, with as many as 20 MPs in working-class seats that voted leave determined to back Brexit. These MPs are sceptical that opinion has shifted away from leave, despite polling by the People’s Vote campaign suggesting otherwise.People’s Vote still hopes its profile will rise again if attempts to build a consensus around one form of Brexit founder in late February or early March, leaving MPs facing the choice of leaving the EU with no deal, or backing a second referendum."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4955686bd35324395b3d6b1814fa18a49e4d4f1/0_62_5080_3048/master/5080.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a83320832ffb08f91e1858936ccbaf58","title":"key figure in tory brexit talks owns firm giving advice on eu exit","story":"Shanker Singham’s Competere offers advice on opportunities arising from BrexitA leading member of a rightwing thinktank who took part in high-level Brexit compromise talks between Tory MPs and the government this week has a political consultancy which does not disclose its clients.Shanker Singham owns a private firm, Competere, which has been advertised as offering clients advice on the opportunities arising from Brexit. He is also a senior adviser on Brexit to a lobbying firm, Grayling.Singham declined to say who his clients were when asked by the . He has previously denied being a lobbyist.On Monday, Singham attended a crucial meeting between the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, prominent members of the hard Brexit European Research Group (ERG), and two Conservative remain MPs.The working group is attempting to break the deadlock over Theresa May’s withdrawal deal with the Malthouse compromise, which proposes negotiating a new Northern Irish protocol along with a free trade deal to replace May’s proposal. Civil servants facilitated the meeting with apparent approval from Downing Street.Singham is seen as a key figure by hard Brexiters as they credit him with providing the intellectual basis for the economic arguments for leaving the EU. Critics have, however, dismissed his arguments, with one describing them as “an awful lot of bluster”.He is a former Washington trade lawyer and lobbyist, who has been described by Michael Gove as the UK’s “leading expert on trade deals”. He has had multiple unminuted meetings with former Department for Exiting the EU (DExEU) minister and anti-EU campaigner Steve Baker.Singham has been employed since March 2016 by the rightwing thinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), which does not declare its donors.However, in parallel to his work at the IEA, he has since January 2016 been the “CEO and chair” of a company called Competere, which he owns.Singham’s LinkedIn profile claims Competere “has successfully engaged governments around the world who seek to harness the power of the market economy through a comprehensive pro-competitive regulatory framework”.In what appears to be an online advert for potential clients, Competere and two other firms offer “unrivalled expertise on US, EU, and UK trade and investment policy, and the ability to tailor our services to serve the needs of companies of all sizes and in multiple markets”.The webpage continues: “We are ready to assist your firm in mitigating risk and creating opportunities as the UK exits from the European Union.”A Competere spokesperson, who declined to identify the firm’s clients, said: “Shanker Singham was offering his 25 years of international trade policy experience to MPs and civil servants in his capacity as CEO of Competere as they work towards securing the best deal for jobs, trade and the economy when the UK departs the EU.”Last May, Singham was recruited by the multinational firm, Huntsworth, to give advice on what it called the “knotty areas” of Brexit and trade. He primarily advises Grayling, the lobbying firm which Huntsworth owns.Singham has previously said that he does not lobby for Grayling, adding his job was “a small part-time role in an advisory capacity only”. Grayling publishes its clients but other Huntsworth companies do not publish full lists. Grayling says Singham does not pass on confidential information.Soon after he took the Grayling job, Singham quit a position on a committee of experts on trade at the Department for International Trade after officials reportedly decided there was a potential conflict of interest.DExEU did not answer when asked if there were any arrangements to prevent a conflict of interest with Singham’s consultancies. The department said Barclay “with the support of officials, has been engaging in a series of meetings with MPs and others to explore alternative arrangements to the backstop. Mr Singham attended on the request of the MPs who were meeting the secretary of state.”Two rightwing thinktanks have been ordered by the Charity Commission to stop promoting reports co-authored by Singham because the thinktanks were both deemed to have broken the rules on political campaigning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/77af2cd1e3bc8fe4fd0a93184b15c4c1fd9a2e04/0_7_5373_3224/master/5373.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c27c22d61fc69a5e4821e68b4039508b","title":"second referendum necessary if no brexit agreement says john mcdonnell politics live","story":"Shadow chancellor says Theresa May must accept Labour’s five demands to win parliamentary vote or ‘we have to go back to the people’Donald Trump is being urged to play hardball with the UK when it negotiates a trade deal with the US after leaving the EU, Huffington Post reports.

Britain faces many, many problems right now from housing to the NHS, and the European Union is not the cause of those problems.She said she decided to talk about Brexit with nothing on to demonstrate that leaving the EU is the “emperor’s new clothes”.For thousands of years men have controlled what women can do with their bodies, and women’s bodies have been seen as something purely existing for sex and for babies. “So what is wrong with a modern day woman taking control of her body and using it to give voice to what is the most depressing political subject in Britain right now?The government must rule out a no-deal Brexit to end the uncertainty that is gripping business and local government services, a former head of the civil service has said.Bob Kerslake also called for a fresh referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU, denying it would itself prolong the uncertainty even though it might take as long as a year to organiseLord Kerslake told BBC Radio 4 parliament had no alternative on the basis that MPs did not support leaving the EU without a deal and there was no majority in the House of Commons for any single form of Brexit.

He was also on Sky News, where he claimed that the decision by Liverpool Wavertree constituency Labour party to subject MP Luciana Berger to a no confidence vote was unrelated to her criticism of Jeremy Corbyn over antisemitism.If people are saying ‘look, we are expressing a vote of no confidence because Luciana has stood up and exposed anti-Semitism in our party’, that would be completely wrong and, of course, we would say that is not right. But it looks as though there’s other issues. It seems on social media, from what I’ve seen, what’s happened is Luciana has been associated in the media with a breakaway party. Some local party members, the media, have asked her to deny that. She hasn’t been clear in that. So my advice really, on all of this, is for Luciana to just put this issue to bed. Say very clearly ‘no, I’m not supporting another party, I’m not jumping ship’. And for local party members to sit down with Luciana and actually say ‘how can we support you? How can we work together in the future?’ And then overcome the present difficulties.Berger, who is Jewish, has been highly critical of antisemitism within Labour and has faced a torrent of abuse from online trolls . She required a police escort at last year’s Labour party conference after receiving death threats. There is some scepticism about McDonnell’s take on reasons for the no confidence vote.The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said this morning that Theresa May must accept Labour’s five demands to get her Brexit deal through or else a second referendum will be necessarySpeaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, he said: If Theresa May said ‘I’ll sign up to Labour’s deal’ and we went to parliament, I think we would have a secure parliamentary majority.

The critical lack of social housing is pushing more and more families into poverty by forcing them into insecure privately rented homes they cannot afford.”Kit Malthouse, the housing minister, said he recognised the challenges identified by the NAO. “Over the last three decades, governments of all stripes have built too few homes of all types,” he said, adding that the figure of 220,000 homes built in 2017-18 was higher than in all but one of the last 31 years.“We’re conducting independent reviews on build-out rates and planning inquiries,” he said. “And through multibillion-pound funding, planning reforms and giving councils the freedom to borrow more to build homes, we’re helping to make the housing market work for everyone.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75c528892fe7eede9e2702803dd12b1bd6405535/0_105_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=09759126ce0b1352b75cf965fdd2e5bd","title":"rugby clubs ticket six nations viagogo","story":"Six Nations tickets that appeared on the resale website Viagogo for inflated prices were leaked via local rugby clubs, it has emerged, prompting warnings that unfettered resale poses a threat to the game’s grassroots.The Rugby Football Union told the  that it sanctioned 57 clubs over ticket resale in 2018 alone and it is understood they have warned them that they risk being stripped of their allocation for international fixtures.It comes after the  revealed that more than a thousand tickets for the tournament had appeared on Viagogo for £370,000, despite resale restrictions that might lead to buyers being refused entry at the turnstile.Subsequent inquiries have revealed that tickets are routinely being resold by members and corporate sponsors of local rugby clubs, which are allocated tickets by governing bodies.Several Viagogo customers said they had received tickets that were clearly part of clubs’ initial allocations.Judy Bowen paid £2,120.48 for four seats at Twickenham to see England v France, despite the tickets having a face value of £100 each. She said the final price due to be paid was unclear and she was even more shocked when later told by the RFU that the tickets were invalid and would be cancelled.According to information printed on the tickets, they were initially allocated to Rosslyn Park, via the RFU’s system of distributing tickets to local rugby clubs. The south-west London club told the  an internal investigation had discovered the tickets were issued to one of its corporate sponsors. “Club sponsors, along with members of Rosslyn Park, are reminded annually of the RFU and club’s policy on the resale of international tickets,” a spokesman said. “The corporate sponsor is now taking internal disciplinary action with the inidual concerned.”Bowen said the process of securing a refund from Viagogo, which she eventually managed, had been “more than a pain”.Adam Dockery paid £4,612.82 for five tickets to see Ireland v England at the Aviva Stadium last weekend, despite the tickets having a face value of €110, only to be denied entry at the gate. He is still trying to secure a refund from Viagogo.His tickets were initially allocated to Banbridge, in County Down, Northern Ireland, the same club where the Irish team’s captain, the hooker Rory Best, is registered.A spokesman for the club said the member responsible for reselling their tickets on Viagogo had since had their access to tickets withdrawn. “Banbridge RFC are firmly against reselling of tickets and will withdraw access to tickets from any member found to have done so,” a spokesperson said.The governing bodies of the countries taking part in the Six Nations typically issue a large proportion of tickets via rugby clubs, who then pass them on to their members. One source at a rugby club told the  that members reselling tickets could threaten the very existence of the club. The source said if the RFU were to sanction the club by reducing or ending its allocation, it could suffer a membership fall‑off because some people join largely to gain access to international tickets.An RFU spokesperson said: “If there is a suspicion that tickets are misused, this will initially be examined by the RFU. The club will be contacted to obtain an explanation, and the RFU will then decide on an appropriate sanction, if applicable, against set guidelines. This can result in a club losing some or all of its ticket allocation in subsequent seasons.”Claire Turnham, who was awarded an MBE for her efforts in securing refunds for consumers through her Victim of Viagogo Facebook group, said: “As a rugby-loving Kiwi it’s devastating to realise the allocation of international tickets may be lost because of this appalling greed. Reselling is responsible for ripping the heart of the game at a grass roots level.”Viagogo said: “The reason nobody can get a Six Nations ticket from the box office is because the RFU doesn’t make tickets available to the general public.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ace151e2c3ec64fff9564acdd76b1f7afc076134/0_212_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e67c50ce11a75f925fc1386c5714882f","title":"max verstappen f1 formula one red bull","story":"Dutchman is starting his fifth season in F1 and the principal thinks that the 21-year-old’s work with Honda will produce a more invested and rounded driverMad Max no more was the Red Bull team principal Christian Horner’s assessment of his driver Max Verstappen’s forthcoming season. Horner, always engaging in discussing the characters of his drivers, was confident that this year it will be mature Max behind the wheel. Yet the test the young Dutchman faces may be his most challenging watching whether he can deliver on Horner’s optimism should be compelling.Verstappen is 21, and has an undeniable talent, aligned to a forceful, uncompromising self belief that has been at times to his detriment as well as his advantage. In both cases he has been impossible to ignore. F1 needs characters fans can relate to and care about, and in that sense Verstappen’s name is already writ large on the marquee.Last season, his fourth in F1, was fascinating. Errors blighted the opening, so much so that a head-butt was proffered to anyone continuing to ask questions about his driving style – not the PR-friendly response that would have been trotted out by most drivers. Frustrations compounded by his dissatisfaction with the team’s Renault power unit, that led to his delightfully frank radio message after a failure in Hungary. “Fuck! What a fucking joke, all the fucking time with this shit, honestly,” as once more PRs shuddered.But then he turned it around in the second half with some exceptional performances, including Russia and Singapore and seven podium positions from the last nine races, taking him to fourth in the championship. Yet that run also included his mistake in tangling with Esteban Ocon in Brazil and subsequently confronting and shoving the Frenchman after the race.There was hand-wringing about it being a terrible example to set but in truth real emotion has always enlivened F1. Verstappen summed it with a brusque honesty, hard not to admire. “We are passionate about the sport, it would be odd if I shook his hand,” he said. “I don’t really have a lot to comment on that, except that he was being a pussy.”But is this the Max we will see this year? Horner believes he is the driver Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel must fear and that given the tools for the job he can fight the pair for the title. Key to that is the Honda power unit they will use for the first time. Horner was optimistic that the manufacturer was on track to be competitive.“We have seen behind the scenes of their evolution. They are making good progress,” he said. “Stability of regulations will help them. They have settled on a concept and, for the first time since their re-entry to F1, that has continued from one season to the next without it being a completely clean sheet of paper. It will all depend on what the others have done, but certainly versus themselves there has been good progress.”Red Bull are in a works relationship with Honda rather than as a customer, a factor Horner said is crucial, describing recent years with Renault as “paying for a first-class ticket and you get an economy seat”.But as McLaren know, pre-season optimism can end in disappointment. Last season Toro Rosso went through eight Honda engines a car by the finale in Abu Dhabi. Three is the maximum before penalties are incurred. Horner was honest in accepting the team were likely to take some hits. “We would rather see consistent evolution, even if that means taking a penalty or two along the way,” he said. But might Max be so understanding?His driving style may be one mitigating factor. Verstappen likes to carry high entry-speed into a corner. He becomes unsettled when he does not have rear stability while the engine delivers the power through the transmission as he downshifts through the gears. It was perhaps best seen in qualifying at Mexico, where he was furious at failing to take pole after having to under-drive apparently precisely because of this issue. If Honda can deliver on this level he will at least feel confident in the car beneath him, a huge benefit.He has also been working closely with Honda and that may make him more amenable to setbacks, as Horner explained. “There is a different engagement between him and the engineering with him and Honda than there was with Renault,” he said. “This is working far more as partnership which he is invested in.”Most importantly, however, the team principal is convinced that the kid he took on in 2016 is now very much a man. “Max has evolved so much,” he said. “The problem last year was there was some antagonism on both sides, that ends in a whirlwind of frustration. He has been through that, that character-building experience. He is more worldly, more experienced. He is in a better place to deal with pressures that are placed on him.”F1 would be all the better if Red Bull can really challenge this season but even if they cannot, how Verstappen handles being in the vanguard or indeed the rearguard is likely to be as engrossing as ever."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1fd612a346c8f5e5213cc71520d234615deb878/0_448_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15b2dfa1f0bc52ae5de2147b3062bda2","title":"free diving antarctica in pictures sahika ercumen","story":"Şahika Ercümen, a world record-holding free-er from Turkey, is ing in Antarctica as part of a scientific research mission.

He means things have got so fluid, with one art form blurring into another, it’s hard to give it a simple definition.He’s well at home at Manipulate. The self-styled festival of “innovative visual theatre and animated film” is the kind of event where you’ll find puppetry without puppets and dance that isn’t really dance. Certainly, I don’t know what you’d call Extremely Pedestrian Chorales (★★★☆☆). Created by choreographer Karl Jay-Lewin and composer Matteo Fargion, it’s like a dadaist riposte to Strictly Come Dancing. Jay-Lewin has codified walking movements into a sequence of eccentric square dances. They are surreal and inconsequential, but performed with the deadpan concentration of competition dancers.The four performers follow instructions from a score – three steps backwards, a leap to the left, a fast shuffle forward – while keeping to mathematical rhythms worthy of a jazz drummer. They introduce each short piece with an enigmatic title – “Out of the depth, I scream” – as if we were watching an otherworldly pop gig. Every so often, they give the cue for a Bach chorale, sweetly sung at the side of the stage by a seven-strong choir but rudely interrupted whenever the dancers have had enough. For all its charm and novelty, however, it is too knowing, an in-joke lost in its own hermetic universe.Wunderkammer (★★★☆☆) by Tübingen’s Figuren Theater is more firmly what you’d expect of an object-theatre festival. It’s a sequence of exquisitely crafted string puppets broodingly lit and set to a forceful soundtrack of percussive keyboard, as if the very ribs of the skeletal marionettes had been turned into music.Three manipulators take turns to open jewellery boxes, out of which crawl spidery hands, weightless acrobats and Chinese kites. There are hints – and only hints – of dinosaurs, birds and reptiles, as if evolution has taken an odd turn to produce two-headed men and people with spines that taper into nothing.Much of the pleasure is in the puppets themselves one furry monster need do nothing more than roll its googly eyes to win a roar of approval. The company is overreliant on this, too often letting the puppets flop around aimlessly after their initial appearance. But even if it is low on dramatic interaction, Wunderkammer has poetic beauty to match its technical dexterity.Best of all is Invisible Lands (★★★★★) by Finland’s Livsmedlet Theatre. It’s the story of refugees, represented by tiny figures, like the population of a model railway, delicate and vulnerable as they flee their war-ravaged home. What makes the show extraordinary is the path they travel. Every mountain pass, snowy outcrop, desert expanse and night-time highway is created by the bodies of Ishmael Falke and Sandrina Lindgren.The performers take turns to bare their flesh as the figures line up for their perilous journey. Falke’s back becomes their escape route from a smoking village Lindgren’s stomach, painted blue, is the sea to Europe knees turn into hill tops, feet form the rendezvous for a bus. The pulses of the performers breathe life into the models as they queue at border crossings, flee helicopters and crowd on to boats. It’s masterfully done, the combination of physical effort and contrasting scale making the wordless tale devastatingly sad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6213bf8f32919f4ed91d28f7b103ad3854973733/328_439_3729_2238/master/3729.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0f22f12d45274a252d5b222a4d40651","title":"dracula review stoker london library","story":"The London LibraryA cast of two do their best to breathe cohesion into a play full of sex, shrieks and floating eyes … but without a vampire in sightGiven that Bram Stoker researched his 1897 gothic novel in this very building there is a certain logic to Dracula becoming the first stage show to be presented here in the London Library’s 178-year history. The production is the work of the site-specific Oxford-based Creation Theatre and turns the normally sedate reading room into a place of ghoulish horror but, not for the first time, I found myself thinking that the English vice is adaptation.Since Kate Kerrow’s brief was to provide a script for two actors, she faced an obvious problem in condensing a novel that uses multiple narrators. Her solution is to focus on the relationship between the sexually dysfunctional solicitor Jonathan Harker and his more adventurous wife, Mina, who seeks to understand the mysterious death of her friend Lucy. This means the two actors have to play a host of other characters – including Dr Seward, Professor Van Helsing and Renfield – and that Harker’s fatal visit to Dracula’s castle now comes near the story’s end rather than as its starting point.There are two big difficulties with this. The story would be virtually incomprehensible unless you had read the book and is hard to follow even if you have. Kerrow also seems unsure about the significance of the blood-sucking Dracula, whom we never actually see. His vampirism is presented as both a noxious virus that infects future generations and a symbol of a demonic sexual force to which the repressed Harkers finally surrender. I’ve heard of the Library of Congress but never before witnessed congress in the library.Faced with a muddled narrative, Helen Tennison’s production throws at it the works: ominous music, vulpine howls, coffin lids rising from the upper balcony and even a pair of glowing, disembodied eyes that suggest a sequel to Cats called Bats. The two actors, Sophie Greenham and Bart Lambert, do a sterling job in steering us through the story. I was left thinking, however, that I’d far rather have a play about Stoker’s complex psyche, including his obsession with Henry Irving, than yet another attempt to boil down his baggy book."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c05c33047263b3f72d98932ecd0717dee622d273/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b54b2f3bac169b947fae628dfa6f7fa","title":"jeff bezos national enquirer blogpost blackmail claim","story":"Amazon chief alleges tabloid threatened to publish nude images of himJeff Bezos has accused the publisher of the National Enquirer of “extortion and blackmail” in a blogpost alleging it threatened to publish revealing personal photos unless the Amazon chief executive publicly affirmed the paper’s reporting was not politically motivated.Bezos, who is the world’s richest man and owns the Washington Post, became the subject of tabloid papers in January after he and his wife, MacKenzie, announced they were orcing. Shortly after, the National Enquirer published “intimate text messages” revealing Bezos’s relationship with Lauren Sánchez, a former TV anchor.Bezos wrote in a Medium blogpost that he employed the private security consultant Gavin de Becker “to determine the motives for the many unusual actions taken by the Enquirer”, which is published by American Media Inc (AMI).Bezos said an “AMI leader” subsequently told him that David Pecker, the chief executive of AMI, was “apoplectic” about the private investigation.In the blogpost, titled “No thank you, Mr Pecker”, Bezos accused AMI of telling him “they had more of my text messages and photos that they would publish if we didn’t stop our investigation”.Bezos said his ownership of the Washington Post was a “complexifier” because it had made him the enemy of people including Donald Trump, who has frequently targeted him. Pecker is a longtime confidant of the president.In December, prosecutors in the southern district of New York gave AMI immunity from prosecution for its cooperation in the investigation into Trump’s presidential campaign and alleged hush payments to a Playboy model. AMI admitted the company had coordinated with Trump’s presidential campaign to “catch and kill” – buy up but not publish – the story of Karen McDougal, the model who claimed she had an affair with Trump. AMI admitted it had worked “in concert” with the campaign to pay McDougal $150,000 for her story and then suppress it. Bezos noted in the blogpost that AMI had entered into the immunity deal.The email, which Bezos published in full, but with personal information redacted, said the Enquirer had obtained a “below the belt selfie – otherwise colloquially known as a ‘d*ck pick’” as well as nine other images. Those included a selfie, a shirtless photo of Bezos holding his phone “while wearing his wedding ring”, a “full-length body selfie” of him in his underwear, and photos and messages from Sánchez.“It would give no editor pleasure to send this email. I hope common sense can prevail – and quickly,” Howard allegedly wrote.Bezos’s blogpost also included an email from Jon Fine, an AMI lawyer, seeking “a public, mutually agreed upon acknowledgment from the Bezos parties, released through a mutually agreeable news outlet, affirming that they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that AM’s coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces, and an agreement that they will cease referring to such a possibility”.The proposed agreement in Fine’s email also said: “AM agrees not to publish, distribute, share, or describe unpublished texts and photos (the ‘Unpublished Materials’)”.Bezos wrote on Thursday: “Rather than capitulate to extortion and blackmail, I’ve decided to publish exactly what they sent me, despite the personal cost and embarrassment they threaten. “Any personal embarrassment AMI could cause me takes a back seat because there’s a much more important matter involved here. If in my position I can’t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?”He continued: “Be assured, no real journalists ever propose anything like what is happening here: I will not report embarrassing information about you if you do X for me. And if you don’t do X quickly, I will report the embarrassing information.”National Enquirer and AMI representatives did not immediately respond to request for comment. Amazon and Bezos’s attorney also did not immediately respond to inquiries."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb058b4c84b60a1947ab2b4e1f4b9e57f7a8fa59/0_232_5274_3164/master/5274.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=947395587c347ddc8592c14028d2ed40","title":"share your experiences of lost footpaths","story":"More than 10,000 miles of footpath are estimated to have been lost from maps.

The first port of call is the Ramblers, whose website gives clear advice on how to identify a lost path and make an application. The method involves comparing new and old maps, plus examination of historical sources. Walking and exploration is involved, but don’t forget that a lost path has to be proven before you can use it, otherwise you are trespassing.2. It is also important to be sure you are not replicating work already underway. This government website can give you information on current applications.3. You may also know of paths that are used regularly, but are not on the definitive map (you can ask your local council to see that map). Any footpath walked by the public for 20 years without any attempt by the landowner to prevent access can be made a right of way.

There are now more than 1,700 of the free, weekly running events in 23 countries, with numbers continuing to rise. Beyond joining local races, there’s an increasing number of “parkrun tourists”, who plan trips in order to tick off unusual and spectacular routes from Singapore to South Africa.There are even unofficial clubs with their own lingo to denote their achievements: the Alphabeteers, who tick off parkruns for each letter of the alphabet the Cowell club (100 or more different events) Fielding club (250 different UK events), Freyne club (250 different global events) Yorkshire Pud-done (all the runs in Yorkshire and the Humber) East-Did-Lands and West-Did-Lands (all the parkruns in the east or west Midlands) and Going for Bailey (attempting to run your first 100 runs at 100 different events).All parkrun events, which are managed by volunteers, stay true to the original aim of being free and inclusive. “Unlike traditional running events that may require pre-registration, entry fees and cut-off times, at parkrun it is free to participate and speed is not important,” says Chrissie Wellington, head of health and wellbeing at Parkrun. “The popularity continues to grow by empowering local communities to implement a permanent mixed-gender, multi-generational health intervention that appeals to a broad cross-section of society. Particularly those for whom physical activity and volunteering is not the norm.”Here are 10 of the best routes in the UK and around the worldNicknamed “Beauty and the Beast”, this route rewards runners with spectacular views after a 210-metre ascent. Whinlatter is one of England’s only true mountain forests, with a route though Douglas fir trees. With a red squirrel reserve and osprey nesting in the valley, it’s also a great area for spotting wildlife.The park’s landscape is breathtaking and varied, with rugged cliffs and sandy beaches giving way to hills and woodland, and a coastal path stretching 186 miles. In a valley at the eastern end, Colby Woodland Garden, near Amroth hosts a parkrun, with three laps along trail paths through the meadow and forests.When it started in September 2012, this was the first beach parkrun in the world running entirely on sand. The out-and-back route starts in the town and heads out along the along the wide sandy beach of Whiterocks. Views on the outward run include Dunluce Castle ruins, the Giant’s Causeway headland and the Skerries, a small group of uninhabited islands around a mile from the coast. The group usually congregate at the watersports centre for tea and cake post-run.The first parkrun to launch outside London, this route laps the beautiful urban park close to the university campus three times. It’s popular with visitors and locals as one of the oldest parkruns but also for its volunteers, including George Webster, 18, who’s become something of a local celebrity in the parkrun world. George, who has Downs syndrome, started as a token collector and has now completed 56 parkruns. He is also a “parkrun star”, acting as an advocate for their life-changing impact and encouraging others to get involved.Australia’s third-largest island is home to an abundance of wildlife, including wallabies, koalas, seals and the eponymous marsupials which vastly outnumber the human population of 4,700. The island, in the state of South Australia, is a 45-minute ferry ride from the mainland port of Cape Jarvis. The coastal parkrun, which launched in 2017, starts and finishes at the tidal pool in Kingscote, the island’s biggest town.With the waves of the Atlantic on one side and golden Namib Desert sand on the other, this is a flat course popular with locals and visitors. The town is one of the largest in Namibia, with a well-kept promenade, wide roads and German colonial architecture, and was one of the first places in the region outside South Africa to host a parkrun.The parkrun team here say they’ve seen an increase in tourists from the UK, Australia and beyond, thanks to the views the route offers. On the first mile, runners see San Francisco Bay and Golden Gate Bridge, depending on the fog. On the return leg, there are views to Alcatraz, the Palace of Fine Arts, and the San Francisco skyline, including the futurist-looking Transamerica Pyramid, the second-tallest building in the city at 259 metres.The first country in south-east Asian to host a parkrun, Singapore now has three. East Coast Park was the first, with a beach park route along a manmade sandy shore. Runners here can enjoy a post-event picnic under the palm trees or a dip in warm Singaporean Strait waters. The route starts at 7.30am rather than the usual 9am, to avoid the humidity, and weaves along the coast between Buddhist monks and dog-walkers.Taking in two countries in one run, this route starts and finishes in the Polish town of Cieszyn but crosses into the Czech Republic along the way. The city was ided between the countries in 1920, following a short border war, with Cieszyn the larger neighbour of its Czech sister city, Český Těšín. The city parkrun here straddles the River Olza, which forms part of the boundary between the two countries. Another two-for-one run is the Severn Bridge parkrun from Wales into England and back, which launched last year. • This article was amended on 7 February to state that Singapore has three parkruns instead of two.

It was hard to tell when we arrived at the empty car park just outside Evolène, in Switzerland’s Val d’Anniviers. The usual ski resort paraphernalia – pylons, giant flashing piste maps, noisy bars – was absent. I couldn’t even see any lifts at first. Then we spied a path leading to a lone rickety-looking, two-man chairlift that clunked up through a milky fog, with an attendant overjoyed to see customers.A long, painfully slow ride led to rolling powder runs of the Evolène T-Bar Resort, which we skied through a blizzard, down to an unspoilt village of centuries-old sun-blackened larch chalets, and pretty La Petite Auberge de Lannaz for a chocolat chaud.We were to discover several sleepy places like these – mountain hamlet first, ski resort second – on our tour of Switzerland’s highly traditional Val d’Anniviers. Skiers who like to tick off the big-league resorts such as Val d’Isère, Chamonix and Verbier might turn their noses up at its collection of small resorts but, surprisingly, it’s the centre of one of the most important developments in European skiing.Last winter saw the launch of the Magic Pass, a season lift-pass covering 30 Swiss resorts. Many of these are tiny (the smallest, Mayens de Conthey, has just one lift) and even the biggest ones – Crans-Montana, Grimentz-Zinal and Villars-Gryon – are not well-known to Brits. The scheme shines a spotlight on interesting little spots that might otherwise be missed, while future-proofing them and saving them from closure.Not all resorts in the scheme are in the Val d’Anniviers, but the most delightful of them lie in this isolated, 15-mile long valley encircled by 4,000-metre peaks, and accessed by sheer-sided zigzagging roads and tunnels. We rented chalets in two to use as a base from which we could drive out to several more.It was an extremely cold week, with lows of -18C, and on our first morning in Chandolin, one of Europe’s highest villages at 1,936 metres, a spellbinding frost made even the air glitter. I snuck out of our chalet, Pin Noir, before the kids woke and stood with a coffee on the terrace – the spire of a church below was almost close enough to touch, the Matterhorn and the serrated ridges of the Zinalrothorn above – relishing the silence.Leaving the kids with their grandparents, we discovered a varied resort of fast blues and reds, and steep off-piste gullies from the Arête des Ombrintses, then took a shortcut home through pines, larch and fir, and across snow-buried gardens. Only five lifts, but still, an exciting resort. In the village – which has two fancy delis, ski shops and a small supermarket – the arrival of the sexy, upmarket Chandolin Boutique Hotel two years ago indicated an optimism for investment even in these tiny places, fuelled in part by the new pass.Chandolin is linked by lift to Saint-Luc – which is again small, with just six lifts – but beautiful and historic. It’s home to the Bella Tola, the valley’s first proper hotel, built in 1859 and a lovely place for tea among antiques, original panelling and stucco, even if you don’t stay. I asked long-time owner, Ann-Françoise Buchs, how the village had changed since her childhood. “Well,” she pondered, “not much. There used to be one sport shop, and now there are two…”Nearby, at Claude Antille’s Petit Musée, an old cellar stuffed with antique farming tools, Claude showed us whole cheeses that were traditionally given to people in their youth, kept for life and consumed by their loved ones at their funeral. On this trip we often found ourselves doing things not usually expected of a ski holiday it felt like travel, not sport.Our second base, Chalet Altitude in the old town of Vercorin, a few miles west, felt like a time-capsule of folksy Alpine antiques and primitive farm furniture. Unchallenging slopes here were fun and perfect for kids and intermediates, and one evening in the village hall we enjoyed a free tasting of delicious wines made with petite arvine and chasselas grapes, plus less familiar blends of 60 local grape varieties. It made me think what a shame it was the Swiss export very little wine.From there we drove to Evolène and then to Grimentz. The latter is one of the largest and most developed resorts on the Magic Pass, with the most thrilling skiing and an attractive centre of ancient dark wooden chalets. Even here, the prime après activity is a tour of the Bourgeoisie, a 16th-century village house, to taste vin du glacier, which is made by blending new wines with old every year in a barrel that’s been going since 1886. In 2013, Grimentz was linked by a major gondola to neighbouring Zinal, another terrific ski area, giving access to some amazing off-piste beneath its wires. We lapped these, encountering no tracks but our own.Pascal Bourquin, director of the Grimentz-Zinal lift company, was a leading force behind the Magic Pass. He told me it was modelled on America’s Epic Pass, a season pass launched by Vail Resorts a decade ago that now has versions covering 65 resorts in the US, Canada, Japan and Europe.“In the majority of resorts, the number of skier days was going down,” he said. So the aim was to encourage locals and regular visitors to ski more often, by dropping the season pass to an irresistible price. All resorts get a proportion of the profits, so the smallest are protected even if they receive few visitors or have a bad snow year.“We were afraid the three big areas would be like a vacuum cleaner and pull everyone,” said Bourquin, “but that hasn’t been the case. It seems everyone is going to all the resorts, even the smaller ones that are really for local people to learn to ski. We were surprised.” This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Young readers reveal why they adore it – from the sarcasm to the timeless love stories ... and Fat MonicaA new survey into teenage media habits done by Childwise shows that the New York-based comedy is the favourite TV show of viewers aged five to 16 in the UK. It’s a remarkable statistic, given that the majority of those surveyed would not even have been born when the series ended in 2004. We asked you to tell us why you love Friends. Here’s what some of you said:It gives us all hope that everything will work out. In real life, friendships don’t happen like they do in Friends and neither do relationships, but I think everyone who watches it wishes they did. I also think people love the idea of always having someone to talk to and share things with.My favourite character is Chandler. I think he is underplayed: many people like Joey and Phoebe because they are seen to get all the best lines, but Chandler has a different type of humour – one that I appreciate! His relationship with Monica is perfect, too, and they balance each other out.My favourite episode has to be The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant. It’s a bit of an odd choice as the gang are at ends with each other, but I love how they do everything they can to work things out. This is really rare nowadays, when a tiny disagreement can end friendships. Molly, 15, HertfordshireI watch Friends almost every day and when I finish the 10th season I rewatch it. I find out a lot of things about life from the show. I like being treated like an adult when I hear people talking about it and I can join in. I have only been allowed to watch it since May as I’m nearly 12.I don’t have a favourite character – I have a list. My top favourite is Fat Monica. Second is Rachel and third is Chandler. Chandler is funny because he’s sarcastic and I like sarcasm.I like all the flashback episodes, but my favourite is where Rachel and Monica watch the Thanksgiving tape and see Ross about to take Rachel to prom. Leah, 11, EnfieldFriends is relatable to nearly every person, as well as being funny. It involves scenarios people my age are starting to go through, but instead of taking them seriously, it manages to make a joke of every single one. It’s based on everyday lives, and most people can relate to one of the characters. My favourite character? That’s a tough one. I’d have to go with Phoebe, because of how she deals with everything that comes her way. She gets herself into situations that are just hilarious.There are too many good episodes to choose from, however one of the best would be The One with Chandler and Monica’s Wedding: Part 2, when Rachel’s pregnancy is revealed to Monica and Phoebe. When Phoebe finds the pregnancy test she assumes it is Monica’s. When Phoebe realises that it is in fact Rachel’s, instead of revealing it, she says she is the one who is pregnant with James Brolin’s child and that she needs to call and let him know! Sam, 16, LeicesterI love Friends because it’s one of the first series (in another language) I ever watched. When I watch episodes again, it’s like going back to my comfort zone.If I had to choose a favourite episode it would be the one when Phoebe and Ross discover that Monica and Chandler have been going out. It’s SO funny … but I think I watched it too many times. Sol, 16, Rosario, ArgentinaFriends has surprisingly been a conservation-starter with a few of my friends. It’s like the glue that sticks us together. Plus, the show stands as the epitome of how friendship should be. Whenever I watch Friends, I fantasise about a friendship circle I would like to have. The silly jokes and the awkwardness between the characters are bonuses.My stand-out character is Phoebe because she is silly but smart and knowledgeable. For a person who you might think would have anger bottled up, she seems pretty calm. She takes control of her own life and she is not abashed about what she does and what she thinks. Hal, 17, IndiaFriends handles issues such as orce, unemployment and unrequited love in an excellently comedic way. It perfectly captures sibling rivalry between Ross and Monica that is surprisingly relatable. It looks at the difference of class and intellect between the friends and you get to know each one personally until you realise there is more to them than meets the eye.My favourite character has to be Chandler. His witty lines, physical comedy and mannerisms just turn him into a super lovable character. Also he’s kinda fit (good looking)! I think everyone has parts of all the characters in them, no matter how much you try not to. (Ross is my least favourite character. He’s so ANNOYING).All the episodes are really funny! If I had to choose a favourite, it would either be the one where Chandler hooks up with one of Joey’s sisters but can’t remember which one, or (spoiler alert) the one where Ross and Rachel finally start dating.

Berlusconi was prime minister at the time and kept a promise to build new homes for the displaced. “It was very emotional to go back there and to meet the people living in those homes,” he said.There had been speculation that Salvini, whose popularity has surged since becoming deputy prime minister and interior minister last June, might be tempted to ditch Forza Italia.But Berlusconi, who has led Italy three times, said in an interview with Corriere della Sera on Wednesday that the League “has no vocation for suicide”.“Relations with Salvini are always good, inspired by a mutual loyalty even when we disagree,” he added.Berlusconi, who has made comebacks from a tax-fraud conviction, sex scandals and health woes, also announced in January that he would run as a candidate in the European elections. Forza Italia belongs to the European People’s party (EPP).He said on Thursday that Europe must return to being a continent “that counts” and not one of “ided states”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3e6960e0b717fe9e2aea63ebc843face7107c6e/0_185_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e8d6659ffcc358f68b5239b929181d4","title":"jamal khashoggi saudi arabia turkey united nations","story":"US media report quotes intelligence sources who intercepted a conversation between Mohammed bin Salman and an aide in 2017Saudi Arabia’s crown prince told a senior aide he would go after Jamal Khashoggi “with a bullet” a year before the dissident journalist was killed inside the kingdom’s Istanbul consulate, according to a US media report.US intelligence understood that Mohammed bin Salman, the country’s 33-year-old de facto ruler, was ready to kill the journalist, although he may not have literally meant to shoot him, according to the New York Times ($).After initially denying any knowledge of Khashoggi’s disappearance, the kingdom has acknowledged that a team killed him inside the diplomatic mission but described it as a rogue operation that did not involve the crown prince.The conversation was intercepted by US intelligence agencies, as part of routine efforts by the National Security Agency and other agencies to capture and store the communications of global leaders, including allied ones, the newspaper reported.It was only recently transcribed, however, because of mounting efforts by US intelligence to find conclusive proof linking the prince to the killing.The conversation took place between the crown prince and an aide, Turki Aldakhil, in September 2017 – about 13 months before the killing, the paper said.The prince said that if Khashoggi could not be enticed to return to Saudi Arabia, then he should be brought back by force. If neither of those methods worked, then he would go after Mr Khashoggi “with a bullet”, the paper reported.The report came after a UN human rights expert looking into the case said the Saudi regime “seriously curtailed and undermined” the Turkish investigation into the murder of Khashoggi.Agnes Callamard, a UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, said the Saudi dissident and Washington Post columnist was the victim of a “brutal, premeditated killing planned and perpetrated by officials of the state of Saudi Arabia”.Khashoggi was lured into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on the promise of being given documents that would help him remarry. Inside he was suffocated and then his body was dismembered, according to a Turkish investigation.In a preliminary report, Callamard said that she had heard “parts of the chilling and gruesome audio material obtained and retained by the Turkish intelligence agency”.Callamard said Turkey’s efforts to carry out a proper investigation had “been seriously curtailed and undermined by Saudi Arabia”.She said: “Woefully inadequate time and access was granted to Turkish investigators to conduct a professional and effective crime-scene examination and search required by international standards for investigation.”Callamard, a French human rights expert, is due to deliver a final report to the UN human rights council in June. On Thursday she provided an assessment of her visit to Turkey to pursue the investigation, from 28 January and 3 February.She said that Saudi killers had exploited diplomatic immunity to carry out the murder.“Guarantees of immunity were never intended to facilitate the commission of a crime and exonerate its authors of their criminal responsibility or to conceal a violation of the right to life,” Callamard said. “The circumstances of the killing and the response by state representatives in its aftermath may be described as ‘immunity for impunity’.”US intelligence chiefs have told Congress that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, almost certainly ordered the killing or was aware of it, but Donald Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, have insisted that the evidence is incomplete and investigations would continue.Pompeo is due to meet the Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, in Washington on Thursday afternoon.Riyadh has denied the prince was involved. The Saudi public prosecutor has charged 11 men with the murder, saying last month that he would seek the death penalty for five of them.Callamard said she had “major concerns” about the fairness of the Saudi proceedings and had asked to visit Riyadh.“The murder of Jamal Khashoggi and the sheer brutality of it has brought irreversible tragedy to his loved ones,” she said. “It is also raising a number of international implications which demand the urgent attention of the international community including the United Nations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6053a2e8562d1b696e420f8f318cb6c03270810/0_122_3552_2132/master/3552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a89e7ea27dc071a20cf6b99ffbcd1898","title":"venezuela maduro us aid trucks arrive colombia border","story":"The first trucks carrying humanitarian aid for Venezuela have arrived at the Colombian border city of Cúcuta, as opponents of Nicolás Maduro step up efforts to further isolate the embattled president.The convoy of two large articulated lorries and seven smaller trucks reached the Tienditas international bridge on Thursday, a day after Venezuelan authorities blockaded the crossing with shipping containers and a fuel tanker.Maduro denies the existence of a humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, and members of his administration have denounced the aid effort as a foreign conspiracy designed to destabilize their government.Opposition activists and their supporters in the US admit that the aid shipments are part of an effort to peel away Venezuela’s military from the embattled president.Honking their horns as they passed a gauntlet of reporters, the trucks pulled up outside a warehouse where the aid will be stored until it can be delivered.A handful of demonstrators gathered to welcome the aid trucks, waving placards and shouting “Maduro out”. One carried a sign reading: “The best humanitarian aid is to rid us of the cancer called Nicolás Maduro.”The US senator Marco Rubio, who has played an active role in shaping Donald Trump’s Venezuela policy, tweeted on Thursday: “Over 50 metric tons of humanitarian aid from the US is now in Colombia. The Post-Maduro future of military leaders in #Venezuela will depend in large part on whether or not they allow that aid to reach the people.”The United Nations estimates 3 million people have fled the country since 2015 to escape chronic food and medicine shortages, crumbling healthcare and transport systems and an economy in freefall.Miguel Pizarro, an opposition lawmaker who is coordinating the aid operation, told the  that blocking the bridge underlined just how desperately Venezuela needed an “orderly transition”.“We are talking about saving lives, we are talking about bringing solutions for many people who have no other form of help, who don’t have people sending them things from overseas, who don’t have money for alternatives,” he said.The US has pledged $20m in aid to Venezuela, though analysts say that will do little to alleviate food shortages.“Twenty million dollars barely scratches the surface of Venezuela’s needs,” said Adam Isacson, a security expert at the Washington Office on Latin America. “So this is mainly about optics. And it’s smart to try to weaken Venezuelan military loyalty to Maduro by putting the armed forces in a position where they’d have to obey a repulsive order: to block food and medicine. Whether he blocks it or lets it in, it’s a lose-lose for Maduro.”In recent years, Cúcuta has come under growing pressure from the crisis next door: hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have passed through the city, putting strain on the local government’s resources.Now, the sweltering border city has become is the epicentre of a standoff pitting an international coalition of western democracies who back the self-declared interim president, Juan Guaidó, against Maduro and his backers in Russia, China, Cuba and Turkey.Venezuelan opposition members gathered at the city’s Casino Internacional Hotel, have yet to determine how to take the aid shipments across. “That’s the million-dollar question,” one member said. “Hopefully we’ll figure it out soon because this is an inflection point in the history of our country.”One Colombian official with knowledge of the talks – which are also taking place at a higher level between Washington, Bogotá and Guaidó’s team in Caracas – said that all options remain on the table. “They could even be flown in,” he said, adding that “it wouldn’t be a breach of Venezuelan sovereignty because Maduro is a tyrant and not the legitimate leader. Juan Guaidó is the country’s leader.”On Thursday the foreign office minister, Alan Duncan, said that the UK was also preparing plans to help aid distribution. He added that the British government was seeking to choke funds that are used to pay the Venezuelan military salaries in a further attempt to undermine Maduro.When Guaidó announced the aid deliveries during a speech in late January, he said Cúcuta would be just one point of delivery, alongside the Dutch Caribbean islands and Boa Vista, a border town in Brazil. No further announcement about those two points has been forthcoming.Meanwhile, more Venezuelan refugees continue to sneak across the border into Colombia every day.Marvín Ramírez had just crossed the river between the two countries, when he heard news of Maduro’s blockade.“Maduro is a thief, he wants the aid for himself and his military too will take it and sell it for themselves,” Ramírez said, stepping into the shade to retreat from the punishing midday sun. “They should just keep it in Cúcuta to help all of us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/594bebc971e2d9475ad20e7b00a49d1ef2ca41db/0_12_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f90d7256b6aa7b5f4c800e978d5a4b8e","title":"brazil mining firm evacuates dam vale","story":"Preventive measure comes after breach at an another Vale-owned mine killed 150 peopleThe Brazilian mining company Vale SA has evacuated about 500 people from a dam area in a mine in the state of Minas Gerais, two weeks after a dam breach at another mine run by the company killed more than 150 people.Vale said the new evacuation at the Gongo Soco mine was a preventive measure.It followed a mandate from the Brazilian mining agency and came after Walm consultancy firm refused to issue a stability statement for the dam."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/daaa41255f1abf2f6ef4b872e3e9401a226bdcb6/210_326_2790_1674/master/2790.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b2640f90df104b0cfe54e5776efbec3","title":"racism confederate statues taken down","story":"Though national news outlets are paying less attention, efforts to remove Confederate statues and other memorials are alive and wellShortly after the horror of the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, there was extensive reporting on the snap decisions of many cities and counties to remove commemorations of the Confederacy, many of which were erected long after the conclusion of the war. Eighteen months later, the national news cycle has largely moved on.The good news that most media, aside from small local outlets, are not covering is the continuing success of grassroots activists fighting to remove statues and plaques, rename landmarks and delete dedications from state houses.One example of this progress is in Jefferson county, West Virginia, where a freshly minted state house delegate is celebrating a victory after a public fight over a plaque outside a courthouse.It began in 2017, in the wake of the rally, when activists sought to have a bronze plaque commemorating Confederate soldiers – which was only affixed in 1966 – removed from the local courthouse.The original call to remove the plaque had come from a group of older African American women.“They called and said, ‘We need your help,’” said Brown, who flew home to attend a hearing about the plaque.Other attendees at the public meeting ceded their time to allow Brown to speak longer, but the county board president refused to allow her to continue, and ordered that she be forcibly removed. That meeting, which voted to keep the plaque, drew national coverage.What went less noticed was the way that the debate around the plaque influenced subsequent elections – Brown made a second run for the state house and won. The plaque was removed in December after many heated debates and another commission vote.It was a victory for what Brown calls “a movement” that is “finally being heard”.As last weekend’s failed rally at Stone Mountain Park near Atlanta shows, white nationalists are struggling post-Charlottesville to muster any real numbers in defense of pro-Confederate monuments and are still facing serious pushback from counter-protesters.Meanwhile, despite a recent setback in Virginia, which is still refusing to pass a bill allowing local authorities to remove monuments, progress has been made, and the movement against monuments and memorials continues to grow.A plaque in the state capitol erected in 1959 by the Children of the Confederacy was removed in January. The state preservation board voted to remove it at the Dallas-area representative Eric Johnson’s request, which came days after Charlottesville, and are now considering what to do with it.A group of representatives from Confederate organizations attempting to prevent the removal of a statue in Lakeland lost their lawsuit last week after a judge ruled that it was a matter of government speech, not free speech. The city is planning to relocate the monument from a park to a cemetery, where it will stand alongside monuments to veterans of other wars.A statue in downtown Winston-Salem, which has been repeatedly vandalized, was scheduled to be removed on 31 January after the city council pointed to “safety reasons” for taking it out of the downtown area. But the Daughters of the Confederacy, who erected the statue in 1905, are engaged in legal action to keep it in place. The land it stands on is privately owned, which means the council’s move would not violate state laws that prevent the removal of statues on public property.The college town of Madison has a 4,000lb Confederate cenotaph erected in a cemetery in 1906 commemorating the Confederate dead (even though 12,000 men from the state died fighting for the Union). In October, the city council voted to remove it after sustained pressure from activists and a continuing community debate. It plans to put the monument in a museum.Nevada’s third-highest peak, named for the president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis, could be renamed. After Charlottesville, the Shoshone tribe began campaigning to return the peak to its original name, Doso Doyabi, which means “white mountain”. In January, the Nevada board of geographic names voted to recommend the name change to the federal government."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fb13e3153d8ec5d3e2c032083b866733a805197/159_47_773_463/master/773.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f4b7484eeeee1750c3ff37a2b34c098","title":"thai princess to run for prime minister against ruling military junta","story":"Surprise move pits Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Varnavadi against leader of 2014 coupThe sister of Thailand’s King Maha Vajiralongkorn has entered the race to become prime minister in next month’s elections in an unprecedented move that redraws the country’s political landscape.Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi said she was exercising her rights as a citizen in accepting an offer to represent the Thai Raksa Chart party. She is the first member of the royal family to run for the office of PM, and will face the coup leader and head of Thailand’s military junta, Prayut Chan-o-cha, who said on Friday he was running to “maintain peace and order”.The Thai monarchy, a revered institution shielded from criticism by strict lese-majesty laws, is traditionally seen as above the political fray, although royals have intervened in moments of political crisis.Thai Raksa Chart is allied to the former PM Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a coup in 2006, but has led the party from exile. The party was created by Thaksin’s Pheu Thai party after the military junta threatened to dissolve it. Ubolratana has openly maintained close ties with Thaksin.The princess is the older sister of King Vajiralongkorn and eldest child of late King Bhumibol Adulyadej. She gave up her official royal title when she married Peter Ladd Jensen, a US citizen and fellow Massachusetts Institute of Technology student, in 1972, but is still considered part of the royal family.“I have relinquished my royal titles and lived as a commoner,” Ubolratana, 67, said in an Instagram post. “I have accepted the Thai Raksa Chart party nomination for prime minister to show my rights and freedom without any privileges above other fellow Thai citizens under the constitution.”The announcement was a profound and unprecedented development that had created a political earthquake, said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, director of the Institute of Security and International Studies at Chulalongkorn University.Prior to Ubolratana’s intervention, the election had been viewed as a battle between Thaksin’s populists and their allies, and the royalist-military establishment.Strict lese-majesty laws make it a crime to criticise, defame or insult members of Thailand\u0027s royal family.In practice, this means open discussion or critical reporting about the royal family is considered illegal.The military junta, which seized power in 2014, has been criticised for using the law –\u0026nbspwhich can see people jailed for up to 15 years on each count – to stifle opposition.\u0026nbspIn 2015, a man was jailed for 30 years\u0026nbspover six Facebook posts and the local printer of the New York Times refused to publish\u0026nbspan edition with a story on the king.Thitinan said the move had catapulted the previously small Thai Raksa Chart into the spotlight. “It is the leading contender for the election now,” he said.The Thai Raksa Chart party said it was deeply honoured that Ubolratana had accepted its nomination. “She is concerned and wishes to take part in lifting Thais out of poverty,” her statement said, according to a translation by local news outlet Khaosod.The party’s leader, Preechapol Pongpanich, said the princess was “knowledgeable and highly suitable”.“I believe there will be no legal problems in terms of her qualification, but we have to wait for the election commission to endorse her candidacy.”It was unclear at this point, Thitinan said, whether her candidacy would create more ision in Thai politics, or the opposite. He said the princess could help bridge a ide in Thai politics as an outsider, but there was a risk of even more polarisation with the royal family on the one side and the military on the other.“Whether it leads to a more reconcilable political environment, we will have to see whether the other main political players are included in the government,” he said in a phone interview.Paul Chambers, a lecturer at the college of Asean community studies at Thailand’s Naresuan University, said that although Ubolratana did not fall under lese-majesty, which prohibits criticism of the royal family, open disapproval of her and her policies would become difficult. “Who would dare campaign against the king’s sister?” he said in an email.“She is a definite threat for Prayut because she holds much more legitimacy to Thais than does a coup leader.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3785975.1549565547!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"dublin wonders why may is coming over here to meet varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLeo Varadkar and Theresa May. The two leaders do not have an easy relationship, and all their previous meetings have come across as scratchy.  Photograph: Simon DawsonBloombergAs British prime minister Theresa May prepared to fly into Dublin to meet Taoiseach Leo Varadkar for dinner and discussions on Brexit tonight, the most common question among political and official sources in Dublin was “why is she coming?”Irish sources said the meeting, which was requested by 10 Downing Street, is part of a round of shuttle diplomacy by Mrs May in advance of key Brexit votes in the House of Commons next week.She was in Brussels yesterday to see European Council president Donald Tusk, his commission counterpart Jean Claude Juncker and the European Parliament’s Brexit chief, Guy Verhofstadt.The reaction among political and official sources in Dublin when Mrs May’s trip was announced was surprise, with Government insiders wondering exactly what would be achieved by it.Dublin made little effort to conceal its scepticism.“She’s very welcome, of course,” said one high-ranking official. “But you’d wonder what she could possibly be coming with?”The verdict of another senior source close to the Brexit decision-making was that her arrival was “not that significant”.Activity and momentumA common view in Dublin is that Mrs May’s visits to Brussels and Dublin are intended to show activity and momentum to those watching in Westminster in order to help her get through next week’s votes – especially a proposal by Labour MP Yvette Cooper which would compel her government to take the no-deal option off the table.Mrs May will ask her MPs to let her continue the effort to change the controversial Northern Ireland backstop and request that her hands not be tied at this stage in the process.Mrs May’s aspiration for help from Ireland and the EU is not entirely built on sand. Tucked in a corner of the statement she and Mr Juncker issued yesterday was the revelation that the British and EU negotiating teams are going to re-engage next week. The prime minister will return to Brussels for further talks the week after.A process has begun but whether it yields a productive outcome for both sides is another matter.Tonight’s meeting is part of it all but Dublin was very clear about what the encounter was not. “This is not a bilateral negotiation on Brexit,” Government Buildings said, in a clear indication that expectations for the meeting, to put it mildly, are not all that high.Frosty atmosphereThe two leaders do not have an easy relationship, and all their previous meetings have come across as scratchy.Government gossips delight in recounting second- and third-hand tales of the frosty atmosphere during encounters between the two.Even people with more direct knowledge of the meetings describe them as “difficult” or sometimes “very difficult”.Insiders joked about giving the pair plenty of wine at tonight’s dinner to see if that helps ease matters. But the chasm between Ireland the UK is not about the two leaders: it is about the terms under which the UK leaves the European Union and specifically how that relates to Ireland.Mrs May knows what the Irish position is – no reopening of the (legally binding) withdrawal agreement, but scope for all sorts of reassurances and declarations in the (not legally binding) political declaration.That was what she heard in Brussels yesterday, too.Tweaked dealBut Mrs May wants – and needs – some concession on the backstop that would enable her to get a tweaked deal through the House of Commons. She wants a time-limit, or a process for the UK to exit the backstop, or a combination of both.Perhaps there may come a time in the fraught weeks ahead when that is up for discussion. But it is not yet, certainly. If that’s what Mrs May asks for tonight, she should be prepared for a rebuff.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: François WalschaertsAFPGetty ImagesThe European Parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator has welcomed Jeremy Corbyn’s offer to support Theresa May’s deal if she agrees to seek a closer economic relationship with the EU after Britain leaves. Guy Verhofstadt said after a meeting with the British prime minister in Brussels on Thursday that any agreement needed a stable, broad-based majority at Westminster.“We have reiterated that we cannot have an agreement with uncertainty in the UK based on majorities of six, seven, eight, nine votes in the House of Commons, that a cross-party co-operation is the way forward. And I think I can say that we welcome also the letter that Jeremy Corbyn has written to Mrs May,” he said. “It’s important now that this leads to a position in the UK that has the broadest possible majority so that we can conclude this negotiation.”In a letter to the prime minister on Wednesday night, Mr Corbyn set out five demands to secure Labour’s support for a Brexit deal. He called for a permanent customs union, including alignment with the EU customs code, a common external tariff and an agreement on commercial policy that includes “a UK say on future EU trade deals”. Close alignment with the single market “should be underpinned by shared institutions and obligations” and a guarantee that Britain would keep pace with EU improvements in workers’ rights.He also called for British participation in EU agencies and security co-operation measures, including the European Arrest Warrant. Mr Corbyn said changing the British government’s red lines to embrace his proposals would make it much less likely that the Northern Ireland backstop would have to be invoked.The letter drew an angry response from Labour MPs who want to reverse Brexit through a second referendum and former shadow Northern Ireland secretary Owen Smith suggested that he could leave the party in protest against it.“I have always been very clear that I think Brexit is a disaster for our country and the Labour Party, if we are to be true to our values, should be opposing it,” he told the BBC.Asked if he could now remain a member of the party he said: “I think that is a very good question and I think it is something that I and lots of other people are considering now.” Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said Mr Corbyn’s letter did not rule out a second referendum, which is among the options the party agreed last year to consider if others failed.Describing a no-deal Brexit as “an economic and human catastrophe” European Parliament president Antonio Tajani said the EU could move on the backstop if Britain modified its negotiating position that rules out membership of the customs union and the single market.“We are open to being more ambitious in our future relationship, including looking at the Irish situation again if the UK’s red lines change. Of course it is impossible for us to change the content of the withdrawal agreement but we need to talk, talk, talk to the United Kingdom,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph:  Dean MouhtaropoulosGetty ImagesTheresa May arrives in Dublin for talks with Taoiseach Leo Varadkar on Friday evening after the European Commission agreed to resume talks with British officials over how to find a way through the Brexit impasse.In Brussels on Thursday, however, the heads of all three EU institutions rejected the British prime minister’s call to reopen the withdrawal agreement to make legally binding changes to the Northern Ireland backstop.European Council president Donald Tusk said there was “still no breakthrough in sight” after meeting Mrs May but, at the end of an hour-long meeting described by both sides as “robust but constructive”, commission president Jean-Claude Juncker agreed to meet the prime minister again before the end of February.The prime minister told Mr Juncker and Mr Tusk that the House of Commons had made clear that it could only approve the withdrawal agreement if it was changed to offer a legally-binding guarantee that Britain could not be trapped indefinitely in the backstop.But the European Parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt said she told him she was not seeking to replace the backstop altogether, as Conservative Brexiteers have demanded.“Mrs May today in the meeting assured us that there will be a backstop, that’s what she said already in Belfast, there is not a question to remove the backstop,” he said.“For us, an all-weather backstop insurance is absolutely key and if there are problems with this backstop as it is now foreseen in the withdrawal agreement, our proposal is to try to solve the problem in the political declaration.”DinnerIrish officials on Thursday played down the significance of Friday’s meeting over dinner, which was requested by Downing Street. Officials stressed that it will not be a bilateral negotiation on Brexit, as negotiations with Britain are handled by the European Commission team led by Michel Barnier.Mr Varadkar will be in Belfast earlier on Friday for meetings with Northern Ireland’s main political parties.“These meetings will provide an opportunity to discuss the ongoing political impasse in Northern Ireland which has been without an Executive and an Assembly for more than two years, and to get the parties’ views on how progress can be made to break the current deadlock.Mr Varadkar and Mrs May will discuss the continued suspension of the Stormont institutions, as well as Brexit.Senior Irish sources said the Taoiseach would give the same message to the prime minister that she received in Brussels on Thursday – that a renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement, including its provisions on the Irish backstop, is not on the table.But Dublin is ready to talk about addressing British concerns about the backstop in the political declaration that accompanies the withdrawal agreement.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

The New York Times were on the ground in Paris with the “Yellow Vests” protesters as they took to the streets for the fourth week in a row. Video: NYT\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe ‘gilets jaunes’ on strike in Marseille.  The sign reads ‘the richer they become, the more numerous we will be’.  Photograph: Gerard JulienAFPGetty Images“We are a group of 10, from various professions, and we have decided to contribute to the Great Debate,” says the introduction to a 10-page manifesto which this week joins thousands of others on granddebat.fr, the internet platform established by president Emmanuel Macron in the hope of leading France out of crisis.On page 3 of the manifesto, the as-yet nameless group lists the consequences of nearly three months of revolt: 13 dead, 2,800 wounded, €5.5 billion in losses (according to the Banque de France) and attacks on toll booths, public buildings, 150 tax centres and 2,000 traffic radars.As demonstrations and rioting by gilets jaunes took hold last November, my neighbour Michel Lemaire began meeting regularly with his friends to discuss their horror at what was unfolding. Their group includes men and women from academia, the private sector and the top echelons of the French civil service.“No one listens to the shopkeepers whose shops are looted,” Lemaire, a retired business executive and commercial court judge, told me. “If you want to go viral, you have to be vulgar, hateful and against something. If you are for something, if you are polite and make coherent arguments, nobody is interested. The minority who support Macron remain silent, so we’re expressing ourselves.”Lemaire accepts with a tinge of sarcasm that he and his friends “are the elite, undeniably”. This is not a good time to be the elite in France. The super rich decamped years ago to London and Brussels. People like the Lemaires worked hard and paid high taxes.“Now we are seen as responsible for all the ills of French society. But we’re ‘the people’ too. We are no more responsible than anyone else for this situation. But they claim we’re crooks who don’t pay taxes.”It wasn’t fair to expect Macron to reverse France’s decline in 18 months, Lemaire says. He believes the French “lack understanding of the basic rules of economics”.The answersThe mayors from small towns who met with Macron in the first debate in Normandy on January 15th were hostile at first. After seven hours, they gave him a standing ovation. Similar performances have followed.“They call Macron arrogant because he is intelligent and knows all the answers,” says Lemaire, who has watched several of the debates. “Well, he has all the answers because he works hard and reads all the dossiers.”Lemaire cites an article Emmanuel Macron: Why Such Hatred? in which the political scientist Dominique Schnapper says Macron “feeds the resentment and sense of social injustice of those who do not succeed”. In such an egalitarian society, where all positions are open to everyone, Schnapper writes, “There are many disappointed and humiliated people”.A poll published on February 5th shows Macron has risen 11 points in opinion polls since the beginning of the year, to a 34 per cent approval rating, higher than before the gilets jaunes crisis.The authors of the manifesto urge Macron to forge ahead with his reform of the unemployment and pension systems, the civil service and multiple, overlapping levels of government. “It’s always complicated,” Lemaire admits.“France allegedly has strict equality in everything. But it doesn’t exist. There’s always the appendix, the codicil, which means that so-and-so is an exception, that so-and-so ‘has a right to’ ... It’s incredible.”The national debate “has relieved pressure and injected a measure of reason into the situation”, Lemaire continues. But he remains pessimistic, because of France’s runaway debt, which stands at nearly 100 per cent of GDP, and costs €45 billion in annual interest. “Nobody gives a damn,” he says. “My grandchildren will be asked to pay it.”Macron has suspended his reforms until the debate closes on March 15th. “His survival will depend on what he proposes,” Lemaire predicts. “My fear is that nothing will happen, that the system will freeze up, whatever he proposes.”Has it been worth all the hours of meetings to draft their manifesto, I ask. “At least we’ll be able to say we tried to do something,” Lemaire replies."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3786636.1549613560!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"amazon s bezos accuses national enquirer of trying to blackmail him","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos: ‘Of course I don’t want personal photos published, but I also won’t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail’. Photograph: Joshua RobertsReuters Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon. com Inc, has accused the owner of the National Enquirer of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing “intimate photos” he allegedly sent to his girlfriend unless he said in public that the supermarket tabloid’s reporting on him was not politically motivated.The accusation, published in a blog post, is the latest twist in a weeks-long saga that has brought the world’s richest person’s private life into the spotlight and thrusts him deeper into a battle with the leading US tabloid publisher, which has had close links with the president of the United States. “Of course I don’t want personal photos published, but I also won’t participate in their well-known practice of blackmail, political favours, political attacks, and corruption,” Mr Bezos wrote. “I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out.”The headline of Mr Bezos’s post, No thank you, Mr. Pecker targeted David Pecker, the head of the tabloid company. In the sometimes digressive text that followed, he accused American Media Inc (AMI) of threatening to publish graphic photographs of him, including a “below-the-belt selfie,” if he did not publicly affirm that the Enquirer’s reporting on his affair was not motivated by political concerns. In the blog, Mr Bezos published an email allegedly from Dylan Howard, chief content officer at AMI, to Martin Singer, noted as “litigation counsel for Mr. de Becker” with the subject line “Jeff Bezos \u0026amp Ms. Lauren Sanchez Photos”. The alleged emailed from Mr Howard to Mr Singer read: “ I wanted to describe to you the photos obtained during our newsgathering.“In addition to the “below the belt selfie—otherwise colloquially known as a ‘d*ck pick’”—The Enquirer obtained a further nine images. These include:· Mr. Bezos face selfie at what appears to be a business meeting.· Ms. Sanchez response—a photograph of her smoking a cigar in what appears to be a simulated oral sex scene.· A shirtless Mr. Bezos holding his phone in his left hand—while wearing his wedding ring. He’s wearing either tight black cargo pants or shorts—and his semi-erect manhood is penetrating the zipper of said garment.· A full-length body selfie of Mr. Bezos wearing just a pair of tight black boxer-briefs or trunks, with his phone in his left hand—while wearing his wedding ring.· A selfie of Mr. Bezos fully clothed.· A full-length scantily-clad body shot with short trunks.· A naked selfie in a bathroom—while wearing his wedding ring. Mr. Bezos is wearing nothing but a white towel—and the top of his pubic region can be seen.· Ms. Sanchez wearing a plunging red neckline dress revealing her cleavage and a glimpse of her nether region.· Ms. Sanchez wearing a two-piece red bikini with gold detail dress revealing her cleavage.” American Media Inc (AMI), the owner of the National Enquirer, did not immediately return a request for comment.Mr Bezos and his wife announced last month that they were orcing after 25 years of marriage, following a period of “loving exploration” and trial separation. That same day, the National Enquirer touted it was publishing alleged intimate text messages between Mr Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former television anchor whom he was said to be dating.Investigation Shortly after that, Mr Bezos opened an investigation into the leak led by Gavin de Becker, a longtime security consultant and former appointee of US president Ronald Reagan. Mr De Becker proceeded to tell media that the leak was politically motivated.Mr Bezos, Amazon and the newspaper he owns privately, the Washington Post, have all been targets of attacks on Twitter by US president Donald Trump. The Washington Post has published many articles critical of the president. It acts as Amazon’s “chief lobbyist,” Mr Trump has said on Twitter, without presenting evidence. Mr Trump called Mr Bezos “Jeff Bozo” in a tweet last month about the National Enquirer’s coverage of his orce.“It’s unavoidable that certain powerful people who experience Washington Post news coverage will wrongly conclude I am their enemy,” Mr Bezos wrote. “President Trump is one of those people, obvious by his many tweets.”The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In his blog, Mr Bezos cited an email from AMI deputy general counsel, Jon Fine, to a lawyer representing Mr de Becker. In it, AMI proposed a public acknowledgment from Mr Bezos and Mr de Becker that “they have no knowledge or basis for suggesting that (AMI’s) coverage was politically motivated or influenced by political forces.”In return for such an acknowledgement, according to the email, AMI offered “not to publish, distribute, share, or describe unpublished texts and photos.”Mr Bezos said the statement AMI was proposing was false and described the offer as an “extortionate proposal.”Mr Fine and Mr de Becker could not immediately be reached for comment.The alleged extortion raises questions among some legal observers about whether AMI and its chief executive Mr Pecker have violated a co-operation agreement AMI made last year with federal prosecutors in connection with a $150,000 (€132,269) hush-money payment given to Karen McDougal, the Playboy model who claims she had an affair with president Donald Trump.The payment was made during the 2016 presidential election to influence that election, according to the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York (SDNY). The deal not to prosecute was conditional on AMI not committing another crime, the office said.A spokesman for the SDNY attorney’s office declined to comment on the matter.Mr Bezos, who owns more than $120 billion in Amazon stock, said in his blog: “If in my position I can’t stand up to this kind of extortion, how many people can?” –Reuters "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2017/10/12/TELEMMGLPICT000140439032_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfy2dmClwgbjjulYfPTELibA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"parliament accused conflict interest rejects nda debate","story":"John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, refused to allow Maria Miller to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerfulHouse of CommonsMaria Miller, the Tory MP, last night accused Parliament of a conflict of interest over Britain\u0027s MeToo scandal after it emerged she had been blocked from questioning the Government over it.The Daily  can reveal John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons, yesterday refused to allow Ms Miller, who chairs the women \u0026amp equalities Commons select committee, to ask an urgent question on the use of gagging clauses by the wealthy and powerful, including the Topshop tycoon Sir Philip Green.Helen Jones, chairman of the petitions select committee, also rejected calls to allow a parliamentary debate on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) after two separate petitions demanding a change to the law between them secured 250,000 signatures. It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination.

She relinquished her royal titles when she married an American, a fellow student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). She orced him after 26 years in 1998 and moved back to Thailand three years later.Her run for office is not guaranteed to permanently set the royal family against the military.  I wouldn’t rule out the possibility of a unity deal after March\u0027s vote, said Mr Lemahieu.Please review our commenting policyComment: Here\u0026#39s how my legal fight aims to fix the backstop, stop a hard border and protect the UnionSir Philip Green: Listen to the phone call threats the billionaire made to Comment: The Green case shows how broken the NDA system is - the Government must take actionBrexit latest news: John McDonnell says second referendum still an option as Theresa May prepares to meet Leo VaradkarDame Sally Davies announces she is to step down as Chief Medical Officer to become first female Trinity College masterWreck discovered of first Japanese warship lost in Second World WarRetired King of the Belgians faces daily fine for refusing paternity test\u0026#39The other\u0026#39s are all gone\u0026#39: Kellyanne Conway on working with Trump, and surviving the White House John McDonnell refuses to offer support to Jewish MP facing calls to be deselectedHow popular is Donald Trump?

That forecast in the bank’s latest Inflation Report is down sharply from the 1.7 per cent growth it estimated in November and would be the feeblest performance since GDP plummeted by 1.4 per cent in 2009.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialIt also sees a roughly one in four probability of a recession in the second half of 2019.\u0026nbsp“This slowdown mainly reflects softer activity abroad and the greater effects from Brexit uncertainties at home,” said the bank, admitting that business investment had been considerably weaker than it previously anticipated due to fears over a Brexit cliff-edge for trade.Yet the bank stressed that even this much weaker outlook was conditioned on a “smooth adjustment” to life outside the EU. Last December it published stress-test scenario for banks in which a no-deal Brexit could plunge Britain into the worst recession since the 1920s, with GDP collapsing by 8 per cent.Speaking at the Bank\u0027s press conference the Governor, Mark Carney, said the risk of the UK crashing out of the EU had gone up.\u0026nbspI would have described no-deal, no transition a few years ago as a low probability event.

Now it expects a fall of 2.75 per cent. Its 2020 forecast is also slashed from 5 per cent to 2.75 per cent.As expected by markets, the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent. The markets are currently pricing in no rate hike until the middle of 2020. In December they had priced in one quarter-point increase in 2019 and another in 2020. With the bank’s inflation forecast broadly unchanged by the end of the forecast period from November, anticipated at\u0026nbsp 2.1 per cent in Q1 2021, markets are likely to take the latest inflation projections as a signal that the MPC is in no hurry to raise rates.The bank’s 2020 GDP growth rate is also reduced to 1.5 per cent, down from 1.7 per cent previously, although it has pencilled in a recovery to 1.9 per cent in 2021 if Brexit is smooth and the UK is safely in the transition period.Emphasising how much damage Brexit has already done to business investment, which accounts for around 10 per cent of UK GDP, the bank noted that the post-2008 recovery in firms’ spending had “stalled” since the 2015 referendum act was passed.Brexit impact on investment“The Bank has today put a major health warning on the UK economy as ongoing Brexit uncertainty and weaker global growth combine. Such a slowdown, should it materialise, is not just about abstract GDP figures but slower earnings and income growth for households all over the country, said\u0026nbspJames Smith of the the Resolution Foundation:“Today’s report should remind politicians across parliament that the stalemated Brexit process comes with a very real price tag.”The bank also published some modelling which suggests that if uncertainty fell and financial conditions across the economy improved, UK GDP growth could be lifted to 1.6 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 2020.The latest report from the bank’s network of regional agents relates that around half of the 200 firms questioned said they are “not ready” for a no-deal Brexit, even though most had a contingency plan in place.In the near term, the bank expects growth in the final quarter of 2018 to have been 0.3 per cent and to decline to 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019. This opens around a small amount of slack (0.25 per cent of GDP) in the economy, according to the bank.The bank reiterated its warning that, in the wake of no-deal Brexit, interest rates could move in either direction, depending on MPC estimates of the extent of damage to demand and supply, although many analysts think that the bank would be more likely to cut rates to support spending in such circumstances.“The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of the EU withdrawal,” said the bank. “In particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom, whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Hazel Sheffield reportsClick to followThe IndependentBrian Kavanagh had been a butcher in Glasgow for more than 20 years when one night, everything changed.His wife, a committed vegan, showed him the film Earthlings, a 2005 documentary narrated by Joaquin Phoenix about the suffering endured by animals at factory farms and research labs.\u0026nbsp“The next morning I went into work and nothing felt right,” Kavanagh says.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“Suddenly the idea of putting something dead inside my body didn’t feel right.”Kavanagh was working as a manager on the meat counter at Morrisons.

But going into work became harder each day.McDonald’s Sweden launches ‘McFalafel’ as first vegan Happy MealThese are the most common misconceptions about vegansWhat it’s like to stay in the world’s first vegan hotel suiteEventually he found work at a small pizza chain. When that closed down the owner of the business introduced him to Hilary Masin and Alberto Casotto, the founders of a vegan meat company called Sgaia’s Vegan Meats.Since 2017, Kavanagh has been working with the firm\u0026nbspat its Glasgow base, producing vegan meat for its\u0026nbspsuppliers and working on new recipes to meet demand. “I am a lot happier – it’s like night and day,” Kavanagh says.\u0026nbspSgaia’s is one of a rising number of food manufacturers branding their products not as vegan alternatives, but as a radical new type of meat. The size of the market for alternatives is still tiny compared with the global meat market, but there are signs the meat industry is watching closely.\u0026nbspIn the US, the beef industry has filed a petition to exclude non-animal products from the definition of meat, while the French have passed a law banning vegetarian companies from calling their products sausages, mince or bacon.\u0026nbspWhen Sean Monson, the producer of Earthlings, co-produced another film about animal rights abuses in 2018 called Dominion, groups in the meat sector reacted angrily. Patrick Hutchinson, the chief executive of the Australian Meat Industry Council, said the film was an “upsetting” representation of the industry. “What the film shows is not representative of the practices of the wider industry,” Hutchinson says. “The vast majority of their employees are deeply committed to ensuring the most humane experience possible for animals.”But Kavanagh says that even as a butcher, he was shielded from the worst practices in the industry. He got into the trade at 16 after seeing a job with a family-run shop advertised at the job centre. “When the first meat van came in, it had the first quarter of a pig with the head still on. I remember thinking I was going to throw up, but you just kind of get used to it,” he says. He stayed with the family butcher and moved on to Morrisons when it closed down, clocking 20 years in the trade.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Creative dishes by vegan YouTubers - In pictures  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Vegan beer and cheddar bread bowl dipTortilla soup and cheesy taquitosVegan beer and cheddar bread bowl dipTortilla soup and cheesy taquitosAt Sgaia’s, Kavanagh is in charge of running the kitchen, keeping up with orders and experimenting with new recipes. He has just developed a square sausage recipe using similar spices he used to use in meat sausages, but switching out the animal protein for gluten and soy.\u0026nbspNext, the company is working on vegan black pudding to add to its growing range of vegan burgers, bacon, pepperoni slices and even steak. “It’s been interesting to use my knowledge for something different,” he says. “The meat all gets sliced the same way in a meat slicer, which I have been using for more than a decade, and after all that practise with sausages, I am pretty fast with a knife.”Founders Masin and Casotto, who both have Italian heritage, started making vegan meat from their home kitchen in Wales in 2013. “We’re really into making food,” Masin says. “After we turned vegan we tried to make salamino for our pizza, which is a kind of ham, and then it became more and more like a challenge to research the way these meats are cured and stored.”\u0026nbspThe business partners started to sell their products at festivals and markets, which led to enquiries from shops and cafes. Masin still remembers the panic when they got the first 14 orders through their website, before they knew how to pack the products and ship them out. “I was studying at university at the time and Aberto called me and said, ‘We can’t do this, it’s too much.’”12 best vegan shoes for womenAfter sell-out appearances at vegan festivals, Sgaia’s moved to Glasgow where it has been supported by a small business growth grant from Paisley Council to take on a catering kitchen and office space. In January, the company sold 5,000 units and 500kg of fake meat products through a handful of ethical suppliers, including Suma, Marigold Health Foods and Greencity Wholefoods, and the company website, which reads: “We don’t make fake meats: they are real, just vegan.”Many vegan meat or food technology companies are trying to get their products stocked in the meat aisles at supermarkets, where environmentally-conscious customers will be confronted with the dilemma of which product to buy. In the US, Beyond Meat has created a burger made principally of yellow pea protein that mimics the texture and taste of meat, with the intention that supermarkets sell the product alongside animal protein. In July, Sainsbury’s trialled stocking plant-based products in refrigerators alongside slaughtered meat.\u0026nbspMasin says the barrier for smaller competitors such as\u0026nbspSgaia’s\u0026nbspis not where plant-based products are stocked, but how hard it is to comply with complex safety rules and to produce at scale. “We’ve been contacted by the major retailers, but because we’re so small it’s difficult for them to work with us,” Masin says. “When the quantity is there, we will look at it.”After two decades in the meat industry, Kavanagh is enjoying working with a much smaller company. He mostly keeps his veganism to himself, apart from when he is manning the pop-up kitchen at vegan festivals, where customers are amazed by his butcher past: “If you’re working for a supermarket, it’s all about profits, basically – whereas this is about making a difference.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But the EU again refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – with any negotiations expected to focus on the future relationship between the UK and EU insteadIn November the bank had expected business investment to grow by 2 per cent in 2019. Now it expects a fall of 2.75 per cent. Its 2020 forecast is also slashed from 5 per cent to 2.75 per cent.As expected by markets, the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to keep interest rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent. The markets are currently pricing in no rate hike until the middle of 2020. In December they had priced in one quarter-point increase in 2019 and another in 2020. With the bank’s inflation forecast broadly unchanged by the end of the forecast period from November, anticipated at\u0026nbsp 2.1 per cent in Q1 2021, markets are likely to take the latest inflation projections as a signal that the MPC is in no hurry to raise rates.The bank’s 2020 GDP growth rate is also reduced to 1.5 per cent, down from 1.7 per cent previously, although it has pencilled in a recovery to 1.9 per cent in 2021 if Brexit is smooth and the UK is safely in the transition period.Emphasising how much damage Brexit has already done to business investment, which accounts for around 10 per cent of UK GDP, the bank noted that the post-2008 recovery in firms’ spending had “stalled” since the 2015 referendum act was passed.Brexit impact on investment“The Bank has today put a major health warning on the UK economy as ongoing Brexit uncertainty and weaker global growth combine. Such a slowdown, should it materialise, is not just about abstract GDP figures but slower earnings and income growth for households all over the country, said\u0026nbspJames Smith of the the Resolution Foundation:“Today’s report should remind politicians across parliament that the stalemated Brexit process comes with a very real price tag.”The bank also published some modelling which suggests that if uncertainty fell and financial conditions across the economy improved, UK GDP growth could be lifted to 1.6 per cent this year and 2.2 per cent in 2020.The latest report from the bank’s network of regional agents relates that around half of the 200 firms questioned said they are “not ready” for a no-deal Brexit, even though most had a contingency plan in place.In the near term, the bank expects growth in the final quarter of 2018 to have been 0.3 per cent and to decline to 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2019. This opens around a small amount of slack (0.25 per cent of GDP) in the economy, according to the bank.The bank reiterated its warning that, in the wake of no-deal Brexit, interest rates could move in either direction, depending on MPC estimates of the extent of damage to demand and supply, although many analysts think that the bank would be more likely to cut rates to support spending in such circumstances.“The economic outlook will continue to depend significantly on the nature of the EU withdrawal,” said the bank. “In particular: the new trading arrangements between the European Union and the United Kingdom, whether the transition to them is abrupt or smooth, and how households, businesses and financial markets respond.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

So we decided to change it.“However, in hindsight I think that was a hasty decision. We could have put more effort into looking at whether we could have adapted it to make sure it was inclusive of everybody.“I have apologised to the parents and we will consider putting it on in future years if we can make sure those bits are edited so it is inclusive for everybody.”The head added that the chair of governors had not played a part in the decision to cancel the play.Stephen Evans, CEO of the National Secular Society, said: “We’re seeing a worrying trend of parents pressuring headteachers and threatening to withdraw children when teaching doesn’t fit their, often narrow, worldview.“Schools should broaden pupils’ horizons and need to be supported to do that when faced with external pressure demanding that the education their children receive conforms with parents’ religious views.”Theory of evolutionOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And yet in fifteen institutions, the proportion of public school pupils is more than 30 per cent, the figures show. \u0026nbspIn this group, which is dominated by small specialist institutions and Russell Group universities, the proportion of state school pupils is as low as 31.1 per cent (the Royal College of Music).Among the Russell Group universities which saw drops were Exeter (a fall of 3.5 percentage points), Imperial College (a fall of 1.9 percentage points) and Durham (a fall of 1.6 percentage points).Oxford and Cambridge were among the institutions with the lowest proportions of state school pupils – 58.2 per cent and 63.4 per cent respectively – but their figures improved on previous years.\u0026nbspThe figures from HESA also revealed a 0.2 percentage point rise in the proportion of students from areas of high disadvantage where there has traditionally been low participation rates at university.But still the proportion of students from these neighbourhoods is only 11.6 per cent. And at King’s College London, it is as low as 3.8 per cent, which is a 1 percentage point drop on last year.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: “It is clear that universities and the government need to do more to widen access to higher education. These figures suggest that progress in this direction has stalled.“The proportion of state school pupils at some universities is significantly out of kilter with the fact that the vast majority of young people attend these schools, including many young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.”Cambridge University given record £100m donation from billionaireSir Peter Lampl, founder of the Sutton Trust, said: “Despite the progress on widening participation made by many universities in the past few years, it is disheartening to still see no significant increase in the numbers of students entering universities from state schools.“This report highlights again the need for concerted action by universities and government alike. We need to see a renewed focus on widening participation so that all young people have a fair chance of getting into university, particularly the most selective ones.”He added that poorer students should be given “a break” through contextual admissions.Sarah Stevens, head of policy at the Russell Group, said: “Overall the proportion of state school pupils entering Russell Group universities has remained steady, accounting for around four out of every five students.“Looking across the Russell Group, the proportion of disadvantaged students is also slightly up.“But where inidual universities have seen dips, they will of course take it seriously and we all want to see further progress.”A Universities UK spokesperson said: “Eighteen year olds from the most disadvantaged areas in England are more likely to go to university than ever before, but we know that a number of challenges remain. We are supporting universities in their efforts to build on work that has increased the number of students from erse backgrounds in recent years.”The organisation called on the government’s post-18 education review to make recommendations that support widening access – including targeted maintenance grants for those most in need.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Until the other day, I had no idea that a sausage even had any meaning (unless, that is, you happen to be ravenously hungry). Imagine the surprise, therefore, of the conservators in London who, back in 1983, were sprucing up a classic painting by the 17th-century Dutch master Jan Steen, when they discovered a lost sausage. Or rather not so much lost as “disappeared”.\u0026nbspYou can see that painting, Celebrating the Birth, in all its domestic glory, in the wonderful Wallace Collection in Manchester Square, just off Oxford Street. But prior to 1983 you would not have seen the sausage, or indeed the hand of the long-haired artist himself, about to go out of the door at the back of the kitchen, holding two fingers over the head of the babe. Painting “cleaners” (or conservators) are sometimes like detectives carefully inspecting the scene of a crime. In this case their research took them back to the Victorian period when the works of Shakespeare could be re-written for the purpose of making more of a happy ending – and when the statue of a naked David in the V\u0026ampA could have a fig-leaf applied to the relevant parts on the occasion of a visit from Queen Victoria.Probably sometime in the 1850s, a skilful painter had been employed to paint over (rather as you might use software today to remove undesirable elements from your favourite holiday snap) the offending sausage and the two-fingered salute – originally dating from 1664 (the year is\u0026nbspspelt out in the painting itself). But what was the big deal about the sausage anyway? How could hypersensitive Victorian morality be offended by the depiction thereof?For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialI had the advantage of being accompanied by the very knowledgeable Anne Fay, head of education at the Wallace Collection, but you can work it all out for yourself just by looking very intently at the restored painting, now hanging in East Gallery II. In Holland you can still talk about a “Jan Steen” household or room. But the phrase isn’t necessarily complimentary. It doesn’t mean “beautiful” or “artistic”, but rather “chaotic” or “messy”. “Celebrating the birth” depicts a busy, bustling kitchen scene or “lying-in room”.There are 16 people crowded into the room (counting the babe), with a lot of cooking going on around the fireplace. In the foreground, lying on the floor are several broken eggshells together with pots of what looks like maple syrup and a roll on a plate. A buxom cook is leaning over a cooking pot mixing some kind of brew with a ladle and holding out her other hand for payment.The sausage (or, technically, a string of sausages) is hanging down from above the fireplace, attached to the chimney. It is long and rather limp-looking and probably deserves the word, “dangling”. A maid is handling it, looking out of the picture directly towards the spectator, with an expression that might be roguish. But what does it mean and why would you want to paint it over? People ate sausages back then, didn’t they? Why would you not have one in a kitchen?The sausage, you will have guessed, is susceptible to a phallic reading. The prudish Victorians\u0026nbspthought so. It could be mistaken for the same sexual organ\u0026nbspthe David fig-leaf was designed to conceal. And a long but rather flaccid one at that. But, as Freud may have said, sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. And isn’t a sausage sometimes nothing more than a traditional form of fast food? But now combine the sausage with the image of the painter holding up two fingers over the head of the father figure.Is this an obscene gesture? Only in the sense that the two fingers are meant to represent horns and thus signify “cuckold”. The painter, in other words, is suggesting – every father’s nightmare – that the father is not in fact the father. His wife is cheating on him. So we look carefully at the nominal father, who is holding the child in one arm and reaching into his pouch with his other hand (probably to pay the midwife). He has a grey beard and an apron, and is no spring chicken. Combined with the limp sausage, the implication is that the ageing man could be impotent and incapable of fathering a child.Who then is the father? And we should remember that there is a pregnant woman in the kitchen, sitting comfortably on the left of the scene, sipping a drink, looking rather beatific (possibly sozzled too). The leading candidate for rogue inseminator is the painter himself. Rather like Alfred Hitchcock making a brief appearance in one of his own movies, Jan Steen would often paint himself into the picture. And if he is making a point here, it is less an assertion of his own sexual prowess than the subtle reminder that indeed he and no other has given birth to every single one of the figures depicted in the painting. The two fingers are like a Steen signature, saying: “I am the artist.”The Wallace Collection is one of the nation’s great treasures but modest in scope by comparison with some of our better-known museums. And it’s housed in a building, Hertford House, that doesn’t look much like a museum either. It was originally a hunting lodge when it was built in the 18th century, with a curving driveway in front. You might not even notice it, tucked away as it is behind Selfridge’s. But the whole collection is an exercise is being more alert and noticing stuff you might not otherwise notice or know about. For example, until I had a good look at a gorgeous ancien régime chest of drawers that once adorned Versailles, I had no idea that the chest of drawers (or “commode”) was an 18th-century invention. I have no idea where they used to put their socks and smalls before then.\u0026nbspMy guide Anne Fay helpfully explained that the word “Rococo” comes from the French rocaille, meaning rocky ground or rockery, and containing elaborate references to natural configurations such as shells and pebbles. But she also directed me towards a small but bewitching painting, The Swing\u0026nbspby the French painter Jean-Honoré Fragonard (dated 1767). The central figure in this work is a pure Disney princess at first glance. The girl on the swing – or let’s say, young woman, aged perhaps 18 at most – is radiant. She seems to generate light or, to turn it around, the spotlight is all on her. She looks ecstatic and her peachy, lacey, frilly dress similarly emanates a kind of joie de vivre. Even her bergère hat is jaunty.But again, if you look carefully, there are elements in this painting that Disney, while borrowing the wardrobe, would surely prohibit. One of the girl’s dainty shoes is flying up through the air. Lying on the ground, to the left of the painting, underneath the swing, is a young man, his hat in his hand, a flower in his buttonhole, his face illuminated by the light of the girl. He too looks delighted. His gaze is directed towards the girl. But if we follow his gaze carefully we can see that he is looking right up into her dress, which is billowing open as she kicks her legs. We see a flash of bare thigh, she may or may not be wearing any underwear, we do not know. But there is a liberated, playful quality to the girl that suggests possibly not. Without any actual cameras, the painting gives us a classic scene of upskirting. But, so far as we can judge, consensual. The girl and the young man may well be lovers.\u0026nbspBut as you might expect there is a love triangle here. Look to the right of the painting and you will see, almost hidden in the shadows, a much older man, who is pulling the ropes attached to the swing – perhaps trying to pull the girl back to him. Who is he? Probably the husband. Also, quite possibly – as in the Steen painting – cuckolded, displaced in the marital bed by the younger man (who is, after all, already lying down and is being given a privileged through-the-keyhole glimpse of what is typically concealed).The girl on the swing looks entirely carefree. She is having a great time. She may be making some mocking gesture to do with her husband. But there are subtle hints in the painting that not all is well. For one thing, if you look carefully, the ropes that suspend the swing from some kind of grotto appear to be fraying. The swing itself may be unsafe. There are storm clouds gathering. The cupid figures dotted around the canvas are looking nervous. And finally, a little white-haired dog that you might not even notice, down on the right-hand side, is watching and barking. As if everything is about to go wrong. The painting is only a still, a snapshot, but it contains narratives, with alternative endingsBut probably the single most famous painting in the whole of the collection is The Laughing Cavalier, by Franz Hals (1624). Of course the irony of this painting is that the subject is neither laughing nor is he a cavalier. But he does look almost absurdly pleased with himself. He is smiling broadly and even his bristling handlebar moustache is smiling. He has rosy cheeks, curly hair, bright eyes, and is in blooming health. There are unproven theories as to who he is or was precisely. But none of that really matters. The laughing cavalier is a hyper-realistic image of vivacity, brimming over with good will and pleasure and, perhaps, anticipation.Because, as in the Fragonard, there is a suggestion of a sexual encounter to come. Is he perhaps a bridegroom looking forward to his wedding night? Or is he on his way to meet his secret lover? His richly detailed garb implies as much. The embroidered sleeve of his silk tunic (with no less than nine buttons on the cuff) is decorated with any number of symbols suggestive of a carnal union: Cupid’s arrows and lovers’ knots. But we also have a flaming cornucopia and a bee – connoting honey and sweetness but also, potentially, a sting.So Hals is being rather poised and ambiguous here. The laughing cavalier is rather like the girl on the swing, on a high, but he could conceivably come down with a bump if he’s not careful. We don’t know, we only have the immortal moment of hope and expectation. Which cannot be extinguished. But could be understood as over-optimistic. And yes, the eyes really do follow you around the room.I live a 10-minute cycle ride away from the Wallace Collection. And yet I barely knew it was there until the other day. The Wallace Collection is due mainly to Sir Richard Wallace, who was probably the illegitimate son of the 4th Marquess of Hertford and is described in a new book by Suzanne Higgott as “the most fortunate man of his day”. His collection was bequeathed to the nation by his widow, Lady Wallace, in 1897. But she didn’t leave any endowment for the purposes of upkeep.The museum, which is free to enter, now makes its living partly on the basis of retail and renting out its space. You can have a wedding party, Jan Steen-style, in the Grand Gallery for a cool £20,000. Or stage your corporate event there, in one of the most elegant settings in the country. Or just come for lunch or dinner in the courtyard café.A museum devoted to dogs is opening in New YorkInside New York’s new spy museumSalvador Dali artwork damaged \u0027by visitors taking photos\u0027 in galleryBut the paintings and fine works that are exhibited there remind you of the importance of not just seeing but looking. As one of the parables (in Mark’s gospel) says, you can see and yet not perceive. One of the great lookers (in the sense of doing the looking rather than being looked at) was Henry Moore. An exhibition of his works is opening at the Wallace in March. Moore would sit here and get inspiration in the armoury. He could see helmets were not just function they were also form. The helmet morphs, in his hands, into a symbol of protection that embraces mother and child.\u0026nbspBut what is the point of art anyway? Is it to reveal, in a Freudian way, the hidden pathways of the unconscious? To boast of the artist’s libido? One plausible evolutionary theory about the function of art maintains that it came about as an accessory to courting. A way of wooing or seducing. Come up and see my cave paintings some time. So therefore it’s not surprising if love triangles and other erotic geometries also get into the picture. But it can’t just be that surely.\u0026nbspFor anyone brought up on Monet and Picasso, the Wallace Collection, with works that date largely from before the French Revolution, comes as a bit of a shock. The level of sheer realism, in some of those Dutch paintings, is dazzling. But there is a connection with modern painters even as abstract as, say, Mark Rothko (whose work is dramatised in the play Red). All those sustained blocks of colour, or Campbell’s soup cans (as painted by Warhol), are related to The Swing and The Laughing Cavalier by virtue of the infra-ordinary – all the stuff that we normally don’t notice. Works of art ask us to be more alert. To be better sensory beings. They are telling us to pay attention to the world. To take note of little things. Even if it’s only a sausage.Andy Martin is the author of Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me. He teaches at the University of Cambridge.\u0026nbspThe exhibition, “Henry Moore: The Helmet Heads”, runs at the Wallace Collection 6 March to 23 June.

(I agree that your game is the world’s game never mind that our “Super Bowl” winners declare themselves “world champions.”)The “firsts” did not end there. It was my first match outside the United States my first trip to Manchester even my first press pass.

So many great contributions to humanity were born here, in the world’s first modern industrial city. The first passenger railway.\u0026nbspI took a train from London to get here! The first professional football league. I visited the national football museum! The first hipster reclaiming of gritty industrial city spaces in pursuit of authenticity. I passed by a group of men shooting up under a railway bridge along the canal path during my morning run!This World Cup shows how far women in football have comeThis felt like a trip to mecca because I was born and raised a football lover. Both footballs. In the United States, girls play soccer – maybe even more than boys – and from the time I could walk I craved to run free in fields and play games. In soccer, I relished the sensations of movement and power, playing midfield, running everywhere on the pitch.\u0026nbspI also grew up a die-hard American college football fan, worshipping in Michigan Stadium, a place we lovingly call “the Big House.” (Capacity is officially 107, 601, but we’ve been known to cram in upwards of 115,000.)For years I watched every game and participated in all the home game rituals and traditions with my dad, who was and still is a season ticketholder with the Wolverines. We always arrived early to watch teams warm up, listen to the PA announcer perform his introductory script, and cheer the team as they took the field, players jumping to tap the “M Club Supports You” banner at midfield.Created with Sketch.Your First Football Shirt: a collection of famous football memories Show all 31Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Alan Shearer, Lucy Bronze, Dwight Yorke and other footballers and famous fans discuss their first football shirt as well as some of their fondest football memories231 Andrei Kanchelskis winning the 1990 European Under 21 Championship for the Soviet UnionAndrei Kanchelskis: In my mind, winning a trophy for your country at any level is one of the greatest accolades.”331 Dwight Yorke on winning the treble for Manchester United in 1999Dwight Yorke: “Winning the treble with Manchester United will always be my favourite achievement in football.”431 Graeme Le Saux on scoring for England v BrazilGraeme Le Saux: Scoring against Brazil is definitely up there531 Alan Shearer on breaking Newcastle United’s goal scoring recordAlan Shearer: “I can’t describe the feeling.

In the 1990s I sat in the stands when Tom Brady – whose New England Patriots just won their sixth Super Bowl – was not the Tom Brady we know today, but was second, even third-string, backing up other future NFL quarterbacks at Michigan.If Brits think their families’ and communities’ commitments to football clubs are more authentic than Americans’ because they go back further, they are looking to the wrong league and teams. Our connections and century-long traditions are not found in the NFL, but, rather, with our college football programs that – like your links to British football clubs – go back to the nineteenth century.Patrice Evra sparks backlash for ‘patronising’ applauding of Eni AlukoAnd our rivalries are just as fierce. Michigan’s rival of more than 100 years standing is The Ohio State University: my mother is a graduate and serious fan. She can tell you all the reasons why OSU traditions surpass the Wolverines’, and how Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh is a beautiful 0-4 versus her Buckeyes. I learned from my mom that women are real, authentic fans too.Women play and follow football, many as seriously as men. But I experienced another first in Manchester. This was also my first experience in a traditionally male workplace that was still almost entirely, unapologetically, male. The only other women I saw in the press areas were serving food or working on the social media and communications teams for Man City and Arsenal. Pep Guardiola was so surprised to see a woman in the press room post-match that, when we made eye contact, his look of shock was priceless.I get it because I’m a historian. This is your “manly” sport. In the United States, our “manly” sports, historically, also happen to be our most insular and quintessentially American sports: baseball and American football. So while they may not translate neatly, I realise we have similar man-zone problems. In my lifetime, both our countries have worked to improve ersity and inclusion in sports participation and sports industries. We both have a long way to go.For all the claims of inclusivity and ersity that I saw in the national football museum on Saturday, I did not see it reflected in the match coverage on Sunday.Here’s the thing. I know there are hundreds, thousands of women in the UK who grew up playing football, cheering for local teams. They know the game as intimately as men do. They write well. They’re clever and funny and bring unique perspectives to their descriptions and analyses of the game. So why weren’t they in the media area on Sunday, and why was Pep so surprised to see me?Created with Sketch.Male cheerleaders make history at 2019 Super Bowl  Show all 7Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Inclusivity does not happen on its own. It requires ever-present work active, thoughtful decision-making by people in positions of leadership to commit to fundamental changes in their hiring practices, their mentoring cultures and professional growth opportunities, and their fostering of inclusive, healthy workplaces.\u0026nbspAfter all, the original construction of modern sport as a male domain was also man-made.\u0026nbsp(Ha.)I teach sports history at Arizona State University, and this semester I’m teaching a course on the history of baseball, or, rather, what baseball history tells us about American history.\u0026nbspHow multi-billion-dollar US college sports exploit their starsWe explore baseball’s critical role in both promoting and affirming an ideology of the supremacy of white men to hold positions of political, economic, and social authority, both within the United States and abroad.\u0026nbspThis was particularly so as the nineteenth century gave way to the twentieth when our country began to indulge its imperial ambitions beyond the North American continent. White men were fit to lead the world’s races, proving it through sporting prowess on the football gridiron and baseball diamond. This effort required pushing out people of African descent, and women, who had always been playing and loving baseball but now were forced to create their own separate – and often alternative or underground – teams and leagues to play in.When Jackie Robinson, who would have been 100 this year, desegregated Major League Baseball, joining the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947, he inspired future generations of young people to stake their rightful claim to sporting spaces despite being told their identities disqualified them.\u0026nbspIdeas about who belongs – and who does not – do not stay in the sport space they leach out and influence ideas about “natural” ability and interest in broader society.Here in England, for 50 years, from 1921 to 1971, the Football Association banned women from football pitches, declaring “the game of football is quite unsuitable for females and should not be encouraged.” By no coincidence, this was at a time that women were gaining confidence both within and beyond sport, securing the right to the vote, enjoying public spaces, and demanding equal treatment in homes and workplaces.\u0026nbspWhat have I learned on my trip of firsts to the city of firsts? Sports hold incredible potential and power for social transformation. Sports are about people, and about bodies, and, most of all, they make us vulnerable. All of us. It’s in the space of vulnerability and strength and power and times of joy and times of pain that we hold the capacity and potential to see the humanity in each other.No matter the location on the planet, women athletes and sports professionals know that sports and politics have always mixed, because we’ve always had to fight so damn hard to play, to write about those who play, to coach and manage and take our seat in the boardroom. We won’t stop fighting to claim our right to play.

Well beyond our galaxy, the Milky Way. Douglas Adams’\u0026nbspline from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy might well have been written especially to describe how far away they’re coming from: “I mean, you may think it’s a long way down the road to the chemist, but that’s just peanuts to space.”The Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 million light years from us the source of the FRBs detected by Chime\u0026nbspis a thousand times more distant than that.Before the project turned its hi-tech gaze on the heavens, there had been only one previously detected incident of a repeating FRB, and that was in 2012. “Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there. And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles – where they’re from and what causes them,” says Ingrid Stairs, a member of the Chime team and an astrophysicist at UBC.The fact that scientists don’t know what is generating the FRBs raises the spectre that they are actually the work of some far-flung civilisation.The Seti (search for extraterrestrial intelligence) Institute in California is dedicated to finding evidence of alien life. Senior astronomer Seth Shostak wrote on the Seti website that FRBs in and of themselves weren’t necessarily cause for cracking open the champagne and laying out the interstellar welcome mat.Billions of stars across space turning into enormous crystals“It’s lore among astronomy grad students that cosmic phenomena are either singular – in other words, there’s only one in the universe – or they’re very common,” Shostak writes. “For example, some folks have argued that Earth might be unique. Maybe there’s only one such bio-friendly world in our galaxy, and we live on it.\u0026nbspBut a more frequently heard opinion is that, among the trillion planets of the Milky Way, there could be many billions that have spawned life.“When, a few years ago, only a handful of FRBs were known, it was unclear whether they were rare or otherwise. Now that more than 60 have been detected, researchers can safely say that there are probably thousands of these things going off every day. They are as ubiquitous as indoor plumbing.”The exciting bit is that the FRB discovered by Chime is repeating. Shostak explains: “There’s a short flash of radio energy – quicker than an eye blink – and then, maybe two days later, it flashes again.“The repetition tells you something about the cause of these radio flashes. Obviously, you can’t expect that colliding black holes or neutron stars are going to return to their corners and collide again a few days later. Whatever is responsible for this series of bursts has to be an ongoing phenomenon.“In addition, the phenomenon has to be tremendously energetic. The radio flashes come from billions of light years away.It’s lore among astronomy grad students that cosmic phenomena are either singular – in other words, there’s only one in the universe – or they’re very common“Clearly, something in that galaxy can muster sufficient energy to produce a signal detectable here on Earth. And it can come up with that energy every few days or so.”Taken on its own, the FRB discovery might not have caused as much general interest as it did. But the news came alongside another announcement, and that concerned ‘Oumuamua.‘Oumuamua is actually the Hawaiian word for scout, or messenger, but it has that lovely science fictional ring to it. A common trope of science fiction is the idea of the Big Dumb Object –\u0026nbspa huge, unknowable, alien structure that appears in our skies or on Earth, a mute testimony to the existence of extraterrestrial life. Think the monoliths from Arthur C Clarke’s 2001: A Space Odyssey or his novel Rendezvous with Rama, in which an enigmatic cylindrical object glides into our solar system.Clarke, who died in 2008, would have loved ‘Oumuamua. The name was coined by scientists at the University of Hawaii when they spotted the\u0026nbspstrange object passing through our system, not unlike Rama, in October 2017.‘Oumuamua was an asteroid –\u0026nbspor something similar –\u0026nbspan elongated lump of rock anything up to a kilometre long, and red in colour. It was notable in astronomical terms because it was the first time an object from outside our solar system was detected to be just passing through.There were the usual internet theories about it being something to do with aliens, of course, but they weren’t taken very seriously. Until October last year, when the chair of Harvard’s astronomy unit, Avi Loeb, went on the record to say, actually, this could be aliens, you know.Basing his statements on the observations that ‘Oumuamua appeared to accelerate at certain points during its passage past us, Loeb told German news magazine Der Spiegel that it “may be a fully operational probe sent intentionally to Earth’s vicinity by an alien civilisation”. He added: “If these beings are peaceful, we could learn a lot from them.”Scientists are generally a little wary about tossing around assertions that not only does alien life exist, but that\u0026nbspit has progressed to the point that it can disguise its spaceships as asteroids and send them spinning through the galaxy.Even Seti, which wears its heart on its sleeve when it comes to its mission to find alien life, has poured cold water on the repeating FRBs being of alien origin. Seth Shostak writes: “Aliens are frequently given the credit for causing new celestial phenomena. A half century ago, Soviet scientists suspected that quasars were actually signals broadcast by highly advanced societies far, far away. In the 1960s, British radio astronomers temporarily referred to pulsars as little green men.“But you can safely bet that aliens are not the cause of FRBs. Why? The bursters are seen all over the sky, that’s why. The same sort of signal is coming from galaxies that are generally separated by billions of light years. So how could aliens organise so much of the universe to engage in broadcasting the same sort of signal? There’s hardly been enough time since the Big Bang to coordinate such widespread teamwork, even if you can think of a reason for it!”This week The New Yorker magazine interviewed Loeb. He could reasonably have been expected to backtrack a little on his pronouncements from October regarding ‘Oumuamua. But not a bit of it. He went further, suggesting that ‘Oumuamua was some kind of solar-powered sail to account\u0026nbspfor its change in speeds, which you would not expect to see from a dead object simply drifting through space.Not believing in aliens is akin to believing the world is flat, vaccines cause autism, and the world was created in seven days. No sensible person believes we are alone in the universeLoeb told The New Yorker:\u0026nbsp“The only thing that came to my mind is that maybe the light from the sun, as it bounces off its surface, gives it an extra push. It’s just like a wind bouncing off a sail on a sailboat. So we checked that and found that you need the thickness of the object to be less than a millimetre in order for that to work. If it is indeed less than a millimetre thick, if it is pushed by the sunlight, then it is maybe a light sail, and I could not think of any natural process that would make a light sail. It is much more likely that it is being made by artificial means, by a technological civilisation.”But Loeb sounded a cautionary note for any ET fans out there. The civilisation that sent out ‘Oumuamua –\u0026nbspmuch in the same way we sent out the Voyager probes – could be long extinct, given the distances it might have travelled.But still, here’s a respected Harvard scientist saying that he believes in aliens: “I do not view the possibility of a technological civilisation as speculative, for two reasons. The first is that we exist. And the second is that at least a quarter of the stars in the Milky Way galaxy have a planet like Earth, with surface conditions that are very similar to Earth, and the chemistry of life as we know it could develop. If you roll the dice so many times, and there are tens of billions of stars in the Milky Way, it is quite likely we are not alone.”It’s the sort of thing people have been saying for years, but to hear it from such an august personage adds weight to the fact that belief in aliens is no longer confined to the tinfoil hat brigade.I punted out the question of whether aliens exist on social media. Perhaps it’s the sort of people who follow me, but nobody came out and said they didn’t believe in the existence of aliens. One reply on Twitter read: “Not believing in aliens is akin to believing the world is flat, vaccines cause autism, and the world was created in seven days. No sensible person believes we are alone in the universe.”Thinking exactly that seems to be ridiculed as much as the idea that there were aliens out there used to be not so long ago. One commenter called the idea “narcissistic” another said, “It would be bizarre to think we are the only life in the universe. Equally bizarre to believe that the universe is small enough for us ever to have the chance of meeting other life.”That last comment is perhaps indicative of the idea that while life might exist on other planets, we might never be able to get there, or vice versa.“Maybe not this year, but in the next five years,” asserts\u0026nbspauthor Rowan Coleman when I ask\u0026nbspon Facebook if 2019 is going to be a big year for aliens. “Nasa are sending probes to Europa and other moons with frozen water on them. There’s a lot of frozen water which is sometimes fluid on mars. Given that microbiotic life can survive on Earth in both freezing and boiling conditions, and in the vacuum of space, it seems pretty obvious we’d find this kind of life within our solar system.”Are aliens sending us messages from light years away?Nasa finds strange alien planet hiding outside our solar systemSatellite mistaken for meteorite crashes across sky above New ZealandNasa scientists plan to send a nuclear robot drill to hunt for aliensDo we really have a right to colonise Mars?David Darby adds:\u0026nbsp“My prediction is that everywhere you find liquid water you will find life – it has been shown to be the case on Earth no matter how extreme the environment. We may only discover microscopic unicellular life as this is the only life that can be expected within our universe. Interstellar travel times would mean that any galactic empire would probably remain undiscovered as our technology won’t get us there. Our planet has been here long enough for them to visit us if they had the technology or inclination. The fact that they haven’t would probably mean that interstellar travel is a technological problem with no solution. The one thing we can be sure of is that ‘the truth is out there’…”The idea of discovering microscopic life is one that has gained much more traction in recent years, and Coleman’s point about life on Earth surviving in extreme conditions is one that comedian Ben Miller made heavily in his recent book The Aliens Are Coming!Miller – who studied at Cambridge for a PhD in solid state physics –\u0026nbspis firmly of the belief that life is out there,\u0026nbspbut that we’re likely to find microbes before the silver spaceships come flying.He tells me about microbes that exist\u0026nbspin hot springs in Yellowstone National Park\u0026nbspin temperatures of 90C, about 30 degrees above what they should be able to withstand. If they can survive in those conditions here on Earth, why not on other planets?Are alien civilisations sending out repeating radio signals and solar-powered probes to investigate life on Earth? What used to be a belief that was cause for ridicule now seems to be much more widely accepted as not just true, but inevitable.Will we find life – whether microscopic bug\u0026nbspor galactic empire – in 2019? It feels, on recent evidence, that if we’re going to make contact, then this year, or the next, or maybe the next after that, seems increasingly likely.

The group reported a loss of 270bn rupees (£2.9bn) for the third quarter of this financial year, the biggest loss recorded in Indian corporate history. Shares in Tata plunged by as much as 30 per cent - the biggest drop in 26 years - after the company revealed the figures. For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe problems largely stem from the Jaguar unit, which makes up the bulk of Tata’s revenue. The group said the automotive industry is “facing significant market, technological, and regulatory headwinds”, and added that investment in new models and technology remains high. this year due to weak sales, contrasting sharply with expectations that the British car maker would break even. JLR announced 4,500 job cuts earlier this year, the majority of which will affect UK workers. The firm has also warned that it needs more certainty around Brexit in order to continue investing in its UK operations, and said a “bad Brexit” would cost the company more than £1.2bn in profit each year.Tata chairman N Chandrasekaran said: “In JLR, the market conditions continue to be challenging particularly in China.

But what about the impact on firms that only sell in the UK? Ben Chu looks at the possible consequencesClick to followThe IndependentSupermarkets may sell only to British-based customers but around 30 per cent of our food is imported from the EUThe Brexit media spotlight has, for understandable reasons, tended to shine on exporting firms and major manufacturers with just-in-time supply chains, such as Nissan.These businesses are clearly at severe risk from the impact of a no-deal Brexit because they would suddenly face EU tariffs or import delivery problems that could shatter their ability to function.But what about UK firms that don’t export or manufacture? What about those companies that simply serve the domestic\u0026nbspmarket? What about smaller companies? What might the impact on them be?For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe answer is (as so often): it depends. If these firms rely on imports for their stock they too are severely exposed to any problems at the border. Think of supermarkets and grocers. They may sell only to British-based customers, but around 30 per cent of our food is imported from the European Union.Retailers that source “fast-fashion” clothing items from developing countries\u0026nbspcould also be adversely affected. That applies as much to small independent shops as it does to department stores.Created with Sketch.Brexit and travel: all you need to know Show all 14Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.British passports that expire after 29 March 2019 will continue to be valid as UK travel documents, but will lose the power that comes with being a European Union passport – notably the right of free movement within the EU27.You will still be able to travel to the EU with your pet after Brexit, but it could well get more complicated depending on the status that the European Union decide to apply.

In theory, mobile phone firms can impose whatever fees they think the market will bear.The impact on domestic manufacturers that mainly sell in the UK will depend on the share of the raw materials they import.Another likely problem for these domestic-focused importers is the pound. Most analysts expect a no-deal Brexit to result in another major fall in the value of sterling versus other currencies.How UK businesses are preparing for BrexitThis would push up their import costs. Some may have taken out hedges against such currency volatility. But those that haven’t will find their costs rise sharply. Smaller firms, in particular, are much less likely to have hedging protection.Liam Fox, the trade secretary, has this week floated the idea of the government abolishing all import tariffs entirely in a no-deal scenario. This could (notwithstanding delivery delays) mean a surge in the availability of cheap manufactured or produce imports from around the world. Even firms that only serve the UK domestic market and don’t import at all could struggle to cope with this sudden burst of cheaper competition.Another factor for domestic-focused firms to consider is the macroeconomic impact of no deal. If this inflicts a severe shock to the overall UK economy – resulting in lower consumer spending and a slump in investment spending by firms – that would probably hit the sales of most domestic firms, regardless of any border or tariff issues. If a no-deal Brexit harms the financial sector, domestic firms may find it harder to access bank borrowing.These firms could also be hit by a shortage of workers if a no-deal scenario results in an exodus of EU workers. Almost a tenth of workers in the construction sector – 200,000 – are EU-born. In retail, hotels and restaurants the share is 25 per cent.The important thing to remember about the UK economy is that everything is connected – no firm, whatever its main market, is an island.Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Meanwhile, a separate\u0026nbspcompensation scheme that has been promised by the Home Office is still not in place.Ms McKenzie said: “I’m concerned that we’re told one thing is happening but the practice appears to be very different. These delays are aggravating features of people’s pain and suffering, and are really inexplicable.”Ms Cooper claimed\u0026nbspthe statistics from the home secretary\u0026nbsp“simply didn’t match” the hardship the committee has observed among Windrush citizens who have been wrongly targeted by immigration enforcement.“While the compensation scheme is still not up and running, the Home Office should be making every effort to support Windrush citizens, alerting people to support that’s available and proactively offering it,” she added.Windrush deaths prompt accusations Government ‘pandering to far right’In the update, Mr Javid also revealed that of the 83 iniduals found to have been wrongly removed from the UK, 10 have since died. The Home Office has made contact with 52, while they have been unable to contact a further 21.More than one in five Windrush scheme decisions have failed to be made within the Home Office’s two-week target, the update showed. The Independent revealed last year that delays in the process had prevented people attending family funerals and heightened their anxiety.Overall, a total of\u0026nbsp2,453 people have been given documentation confirming status. The majority were from the Caribbean islands,\u0026nbspwith the second most common nationality from India (107)\u0026nbspand the third Nigeria (60).Mr Javid said the Vulnerable Persons Team, a separate scheme designed to provide help and advice where vulnerability issues are identified, has\u0026nbspprovided support to 614 iniduals, with 52 cases ongoing, and continues to\u0026nbspreceive 10 to 20 new referrals each week.The home secretary told the committee: “I continue to believe it is important that we take a cross party-approach which recognises the most important thing we can do is ensure the wrongs which some members of the Windrush generation have faced are put right.\u0026nbsp“I can reassure members that my department remains entirely focused on righting the wrongs experienced by the Windrush generation.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This is why we insist on the backstop.”\u0026nbspMs May has promised to put forward a fresh plan for maintaining an open border in Northern Ireland by next Wednesday, but Mr Tusk warned that any new proposals from the UK must be “believeable”.\u0026nbspHe said: “Give us a believable guarantee for peace in Northern Ireland and the UK will leave the EU as a trusted friend.\u0026nbspLive – EU council president says ‘we will not gamble with peace’“I hope the UK government will present ideas that will both respect this point of view and at the same time command a clear and stable majority in the House of Commons.”His stance was echoed by Mr Varadkar, who said\u0026nbsphe was “open to further discussions” with the UK but that the current withdrawal agreement remained\u0026nbsp”the best deal possible”.He said: “While we expect that the backstop will never be used, we agreed again today that it is needed as a legal guarantee to ensure that there is no return to a hard border on the island of Ireland while protecting the integrity of our European single market and customs union.“I think the events in London and the instability in British politics\u0026nbspin recent weeks demonstrates exactly why we need a legal guarantee and a solution that is operable, that we know will work and will last.”After their joint press conference, microphones recorded Mr Varadkar joking to Mr Tusk: “They’ll give you terrible trouble in the British press.”A laughing Mr Tusk replied: “Yes I know.”The comments sparked a furious response from Brexiteers.Andrea Leadsom, the leader of the Commons, said Mr Tusk has no manners, telling\u0026nbspthe BBC: “I think that what he has said is pretty unacceptable and pretty disgraceful.I\u0027m sure that when he reflects on it he may well wish he hadn\u0027t done it.The DUP’s Sammy Wilson called Mr Tusk a\u0026nbsp”devilish, trident-wielding, euro maniac”, adding: “Donald Tusk once again shows his contempt for the 17.4 million people who voted to escape the corruption of the EU and seek the paradise of a free and prosperous kingdom. This devilish euro maniac is doing his best to keep the United Kingdom bound by the chains of EU bureaucracy and control.”Asked about the row, Ms May’s official spokesman said: “It’s a question for Donald Tusk whether he thinks using that language was appropriate.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She is said to have told leaders behind closed doors that she accepts the backstop cannot be scrapped –\u0026nbspin a move likely to enrage her Eurosceptic Tory MPs.\u0026nbspEven if a Brexit deal is agreed, will we leave on 29 March?Rabid Brexiteers could learn a thing or two from TuskNearly £7,000 knocked off price of average UK home in Brexit slumpSpeaking after a meeting with the prime minister in Brussels, Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said “we welcome” the letter the Labour leader had sent to the prime minister\u0026nbsplaying out his party’s alternative proposals.“We have reiterated that we cannot have an agreement with uncertainty in the UK based on majorities of six, seven, eight, nine votes in the House of Commons,” Mr Verhofstadt said in a joint press conference with the parliament’s president Antonio Tajani.“That cross-party cooperation is the way forward and I think I can say that we welcome the letter that Jeremy Corbyn has written to Mrs May to offer such a cross-party exit, I should say, to the Brexit.\u0026nbsp“It’s important now that this leads to a position in the UK that has the broadest possible majority so that we can conclude this negotiation.”He also confirmed that Ms May had in the meeting not sought to scrap the backstop and conceded it was necessary, adding: “Mrs May today in the meeting assured us that there will be a backstop. What she said already in Belfast: there’s no question to remove the backstop, because that is absolutely necessary for securing and safeguarding the Good Friday Agreement, internal market, and peace process.”The prime minister is understood to have received a similar message from Donald Tusk, the European Council president who represents the collective views of member states.Jeremy Corbyn writes to Theresa May outlining his five Brexit demands Sources with knowledge of the meeting between\u0026nbspMr Tusk and the prime minister said the president told Ms May that “the Corbyn plan could be a promising way out of the impasse”, according to\u0026nbspBuzzfeed News.EU officials who examined the Labour plan believe it to be broadly in line with EU negotiating guidelines, the website says.Labour last night called for a “permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union”, close alignment with the single market underpinned by “shared institutions”, protections on workers rights, and UK participation in some EU agencies. The policy moves the party closer to a so-called “Norway+” Brexit that would keep the UK in the bloc’s orbit, though technically outside.In a joint statement the British government and European Commission said Ms May had had a “robust but constructive” meeting with president Jean-Claude Juncker, and that the pair would meet again before the end of the month.The two negotiating teams have been formally stood down since the withdrawal agreement was agreed between the two sides last year, with the EU saying it did not anticipate any further meetings. But with MPs in Westminster blocking the ratification of the agreement, officials will begin meeting again.The joint statement said the gathering was “held in a spirit of working together to achieve the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the EU”.Theresa May is said to have explained the situation in Westminster to Mr Juncker and raised “various options for dealing with these concerns”.But Mr Juncker responded by underlining that the EU27 would not reopen the withdrawal agreement – describing it as ”a carefully balanced compromise between the European Union and the UK, in which both sides have made significant concessions to arrive at a deal”.He however “expressed his openness to add wording to the political declaration agreed by the EU27 and the UK in order to be more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship between the European Union and the UK”, according to the read-out of the meeting.Created with Sketch.Brexit deal vote: Opposing groups of protesters gather by parliament Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.An anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester adjusts her pro-EU wig A message to Jeremy Corbyn in support of a people’s voteA mock Titanic captained by Theresa May heads towards an iceberg in a stunt by campaigning group AvaazProtesters of opposing sides are in close contact outside of parliamentPaintings of Theresa May and Jeremy CorbynFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentA pro-Brexit protester in Parliament SquareOpposing protesters share the space outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters stand on Westminster BridgeFormer Ukip leader Nigel Farage speaks to the media at the protests outside parliamentAnti-Brexit protesters demonstrate outside the Houses of ParliamentA pro-Brexit protester sets up outside parliamentAn anti-Brexit protester waves an EU flag on Westminster BridgeProtesters of opposing sides demonstrate outside parliamentProtesters of opposing sides stand near parliamentThe statement concluded: “The discussion was robust but constructive. Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council. The prime minister and the president will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions.”Ms May’s meeting Mr Tusk comes a day after he caused a row by warning that there was a “special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit without even a basic plan for how to actually enact it. Speaking after her meeting she said: “I’ve raised with President Tusk the language that he used yesterday which was not helpful and caused widespread dismay in the UK.\u0026nbspThe point I made to him is that we should both be working to ensure we should deliver a close relationship between the UK and EU in the future and that’s what he should be focusing on.”Speaking on her way back to London, she added: “I’ve had a good series of meetings today. We’ve had robust discussions but they’ve been constructive.\u0026nbsp“What I’ve set out is our clear position: that we must secure legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement to deal with the concerns that parliament has over the backstop. Taking that: changes with the backstop, together with the other work we’re doing on workers’ rights and other issues, will deliver a stable majority in parliament. That’s what I’ve continued to push for.”Mr Tusk said there was “still no breakthrough in sight” and that “talks will continue”.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

that Britain has sold itself a project that cannot possibly deliver on what it promised.Asked whether she is simply an exhibitionist, Dr Bateman said: I am completely comfortable with my own body, I view women\u0027s bodies as one of the big battlegrounds that we face today.And actually by engaging with society about women\u0027s bodies, one of the things it shows is the way in which people are quick to judge women purely based on their bodies.For thousands of years men have controlled what women can do with their bodies, and women\u0027s bodies have been seen as something purely existing for sex and for babies.So what is wrong with a modern day woman taking control of her body and using it to give voice to what is the most depressing political subject in Britain right now?Co-presenter Nick Robinson noted at the end of the interview: I want you to know that my computer screen was strategically placed so I have only been listening to what was being said.Theresa May has to accept that the only way she will get a Brexit deal through parliament is to back Labour\u0027s five demands, shadow chancellor John McDonnell has said.He told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme his party\u0027s plans are a traditional British compromise, and said: We believe a deal like this, put before Parliament again, could secure a majority and what you\u0027re seeing here is, yes, parliament asserting control, and the PM has to accept that the only way she\u0027ll get something through parliament is a compromise like this.A second referendum is still on the table if Ms\u0026nbspMay does not approve the suggested deal or parliament cannot reach an agreement, he said.Mr McDonnell said Labour\u0027s deal would command a secure majority.He said: If Theresa May said \u0027I\u0027ll sign up to Labour\u0027s deal\u0027 and we went to Parliament, I think we would have a secure parliamentary majority.But we\u0027re at that stage now where we\u0027re saying very clearly to everybody that people have looked over the edge of a no-deal Brexit and it could be catastrophic for our economy.The shadow chancellor added: In the national interest we have got to come together to secure a compromise, and then if we can\u0027t do that, well yes, we have to go back to the people.Theresa May\u0027s\u0026nbspBrexit\u0026nbspdeal risks causing\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspnever-ending nightmare for British citzens and businesses, two former senior civil servants will warn today.\u0026nbspLord Kerslake, former head of the Home Civil Service, and\u0026nbspLord Kerr, who headed up the Diplomatic Service, will say that the prime minister\u0027s withdrawal agreement\u0026nbspwould deliver a leap in the dark Brexit.More here:\u0026nbspWelcome to The Independent\u0027s politics liveblog, where we will be bringing you the latest updates throughout the day.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

My fear is that this is the leadership rolling\u0026nbspthe pitch for accepting a version of Theresa May’s deal, and I think that will be at odds with our values and damaging to our country and damaging to the politics that we’ve traditionally believed it.Labour row over Brexit deepens as remainer MPs hint at quitting party“Brexit is a right-wing ideological project and we should be opposing it on those terms.”Asked whether he would resign over the issue, Mr Smith admitted he was “considering” whether he could continue as a Labour MP, saying: “I think that’s a very good question and I think it’s something that I and lots of other people are considering right now.”Pushed on whether he could quit if Ms May’s Brexit deal is passed next month, he replied: “That’s possible.”Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger, another supporter of the campaign for a Final Say referendum, also refused to rule out leaving the party.\u0026nbspAppearing on ITV’s\u0026nbspPeston, she did not deny being part of discussions about a breakaway party and admitted there was “a disaffection with the lack of leadership we’re seeing on all sides”.\u0026nbspAsked whether she might quit, she said: “I’m focused on Brexit – that’s my responsibility as a constituency MP.”She added: “There’s many people that have many different challenges, not just Brexit, in terms of seeing leadership from all the main political parties.”It comes after Chris Leslie, another leading advocate of a fresh referendum, hinted that he could also quit, telling\u0026nbspThe Observer: “A lot of people’s patience is being tested right now. I think there are some questions we are all going to have to face, especially if Labour enables Brexit.”With the party threatening to be engulfed by civil war over Brexit, Labour officials emailed MPs insisting they had not ruled out backing\u0026nbspanother referendum.In a briefing document justifying Mr Corbyn’s decision to reach out to Ms May,\u0026nbspthey wrote: “This is consistent with our conference policy and the\u0026nbspfrontbench amendment we set out on 29 January: that made clear there are two credible options that Labour could support to prevent no deal and break the current impasse – either a close economic relationship or a public vote. This letter sets out in more detail the first of those options. It does\u0026nbspnot rule out the latter.”Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, also sought to quell the growing backlash, telling the BBC: “What this letter does is to set out that the prime minister needs to abandon her Brexit red lines. It does not rule out the option of a second referendum – a public vote – and Jeremy Corbyn is going be writing to members today to reassure them about that.”Sir Keir is seen to\u0026nbspbe\u0026nbspmore favourable\u0026nbspthan Mr Corbyn’s inner circle to the idea of Labour backing another referendum.Defending his offer to work with Ms May, Mr Corbyn told Sky News: “Half of our trade is with Europe, a lot of our manufacturing industries are very frightened and very worried at the moment that on 29 March there will be a cliff edge. There cannot be a cliff edge and we will do everything we can in parliament to prevent this cliff edge exit.”In\u0026nbspan email to party members, he said: “Labour can and must take a lead in bringing our country together.“We are convinced that our sensible alternative, set out in the five demands in my letter, could both win the support of parliament and bring together those who voted Leave and Remain.”He added: “Theresa May is unable to reach a sensible deal because it would split the Tories – and we will never vote for a bad Tory deal.“If parliament is deadlocked, then the best outcome would be a general election. Without it, we will keep all options on the table, as agreed in our party conference motion, including the option of a public vote.”That was not enough to reassure supporters of a Final Say referendum, with MPs condemning Mr Corbyn’s offer to work with Ms May if she agreed to meet\u0026nbspLabour’s five conditions.Writing exclusively for The Independent, Streatham MP Chuka Umunna said: “These tests are nonsense and Labour’s policy is all over the place.\u0026nbspEU mobile roaming charges could return overnight after no-deal BrexitEU parliament chiefs welcome Jeremy Corbyn’s new Brexit plansNearly £7,000 knocked off price of average UK home in Brexit slump“Above all, the letter makes no mention of referring this back to the people. The spirit of Labour’s conference policy was that if we couldn’t get an election, Labour would commit to referring this issue back to the people.”He added: “The leader and those around him have made it clear they have no interest in going there at all. He has also tacitly given a green light to those who not only won’t support a People’s Vote but are also happy to thwart the House of Commons’ ability to stop the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal in 50 days.“That is the harsh reality of what we have learned these past couple of weeks. The party won’t be forgiven by the next generation.”Mr Corbyn’s letter was welcomed by the EU, however. The European Parliament’s Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, said in a joint statement with\u0026nbspits president,\u0026nbspAntonio Tajani: “Cross-party cooperation is the way forward and I think I can say that we welcome the letter that Jeremy Corbyn has written to Mrs May to offer such a cross-party exit, I should say, to the Brexit.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I still believe that no deal would be a catastrophe for this country.”Mr Hammond is the second minister to set a deadline of next week for firm progress towards passing a deal, after Richard Harrington, the business minister, did the same.Meanwhile, senior No 10 officials denied the prime minister had told Mr Verhofstadt that her energies were focused on “changes“ to the backstop, rather than replacing it – as she whipped Tory MPs to support last week.Pointing to a possible time limit, an exit mechanism and technology-based\u0026nbsp“alternative arrangements”, one said:\u0026nbsp“There are three options and we continue to work on all of those.”In a joint statement the British government and European Commission said Ms May had had a “robust but constructive” meeting with president Mr\u0026nbspJuncker, and that the pair would meet again before the end of the month.The two negotiating teams have been formally stood down since the withdrawal agreement was agreed between the two sides last year, with the EU saying it did not anticipate any further meetings. But with MPs in Westminster blocking the ratification of the agreement, officials will begin meeting again.The joint statement said the gathering was “held in a spirit of working together to achieve the UK’s orderly withdrawal from the EU”.Theresa May is said to have explained the situation in Westminster to Mr Juncker and raised “various options for dealing with these concerns”.But Mr Juncker responded by underlining that the EU27 would not reopen the withdrawal agreement – describing it as ”a carefully balanced compromise between the European Union and the UK, in which both sides have made significant concessions to arrive at a deal”.Created with Sketch.

Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council. The prime minister and the president will meet again before the end of February to take stock of these discussions.”Ms May’s meeting Mr Tusk comes a day after he caused a row by warning that there was a “special place in hell” for those who promoted Brexit without even a basic plan for how to actually enact it. Speaking after her meeting she said: “I’ve raised with President Tusk the language that he used yesterday which was not helpful and caused widespread dismay in the UK. The point I made to him is that we should both be working to ensure we should deliver a close relationship between the UK and EU in the future and that’s what he should be focusing on.”Speaking on her way back to London, she added: “I’ve had a good series of meetings today. We’ve had robust discussions but they’ve been constructive.\u0026nbsp“What I’ve set out is our clear position,\u0026nbspthat we must secure legally binding changes to the withdrawal agreement to deal with the concerns that parliament has over the backstop. Taking that,\u0026nbspchanges with the backstop, together with the other work we’re doing on workers’ rights and other issues, will deliver a stable majority in parliament. That’s what I’ve continued to push for.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The setting means that you can only open WhatsApp if you have the right fingerprint or face, just like when you unlock your phone.It means that anyone who shares their phone around or is likely to have it unlocked can keep messages secret, even if other apps aren\u0027t locked up.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trialThe feature involves a slight trade-off: it\u0027s much harder for anyone to get into your chats, but it\u0027s also a little harder for you to do so, too. You\u0027ll be forced to show your face or your fingerprint every time you try and message someone.The feature is very easy to turn on: open WhatsApp\u0027s settings, head to the Privacy option, and click it to on.

It is worth having a full look through all of those pages.Facebook banned from mixing up WhatsApp and Instagram data by GermanyThere\u0027s one thing to beware of: even though the feature locks access to the\u0026nbspapp, it doesn\u0027t lock the notifications. That means if someone has your phone then they\u0027ll still be able to see messages when they come in, and will even be able to reply to them if they pull down and use the quick reply feature.That can be turned off easily, though it once again means sacrificing ease for security. To do so, head into the notifications option in the Settings app, click on WhatsApp and turn off show previews.The same can be done with other apps, though many have not yet integrated the biometric settings and so anyone with your phone is likely to be able to get into your messages. Apple does not offer a way to lock specific apps, meaning that developers have to introduce the features if they are to be included.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I can be totally funded by oil and gas, by big pharma, and there’s no limit to that whatsoever.”The congresswoman, who represents New York’s 14th district, then noted how a corrupt legislator could even buy stocks in a\u0026nbspcompany, then write laws deregulating that industry, causing the share price to soar and pocket a huge profit.“You could do that,” confirmed one of the officials, adding that even the minor ethics regulations which did apply to members of Congress did not affect the president.“So I and every member of this body are being held to a higher ethical standard than the president of the United States,” Ms Ocasio-Cortez concluded.“It’s already super legal as we have seen for me to be a pretty bad guy. So it’s even easier for the president to be one.”Ms Ocasio-Cortez won her seat in congress by unseating long-time Democrat elder statesmen Joe Crowley, who outspent her in the primary campaign 18 to 1.Almost 75 per cent of her campaign funding came from small inidual donations, compared to just 1 per cent for Mr Crowley, who was mostly funded by larger businesses.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have the technology to do it. We have the moral obligation. We have the economic imperative. We just need the political will to get this done. The sun is setting on the dirty energy of the past. Today marks the dawn of a new era of climate action.Here’s what you need to know:The deal is not a piece of legislation — it is a framework for a dramatic restructuring of the US economyThe resolution released by Ms Ocasio-Cortez and Mr Markey offer a range of actions that they view as necessary to combat the immense threats posed by climate change. It is also non-binding, meaning that it would not be necessary for the provisions to be enacted if it is voted on and passed.With 60 House cosponsors and nine cosponsors in the Senate, the ideas put forth would include massive infrastructure investment challenges already posed by climate change, including efforts to mitigate the increasing impacts of drought, wildfires, and rising sea levels the world has already seen.The deal also focuses on economic concerns of Americans who are suffering from wage stagnation, and a growing wealth disparity in the country.Altogether, the relatively short document released on Thursday by supporters of the deal includes a preamble, five goals, 14 projects, and 15 requirements.The deal proposes a prescription to combat rising costs of climate changeRecent climate change reports have put forth dramatic predictions on how damaging climate change will be. Forests will burn as a result of drought, food will become scarce, coastal communities will flood, and any number of species on Earth could face significant hardship.By 2100, according to some estimates, climate change could lead to as much as $500bn in lost output. Meanwhile, the United Nations warned late last year that the world has just 12 years to keep global temperatures from raising above 1.5C before risking any number of climate related catastrophes, a report that serves to underline the urgency of the deal put forth by Democrats on Thursday.Pelosi turns nose up at Ocasio-Cortez’s ‘Green dream or whatever’To combat those costs, the Green New Deal would call for a net-zero carbon emission output in the United States, achieved in part by investment in green American transportation and renewable energies. The loft goal set forth by Democrats would see that emission rate by 2030.Vulnerable communities are a particular focus in the resolutionAs climate change impacts are felt across the country and globe, those most vulnerable in society will be on the front lines, the document says.That includes communities of color, indigenous people, migrant workers, and the elderly, amongst others.“Climate change, pollution and environmental destruction have exacerbated systemic racial, regional, social, environment and economic injustices,” the resolution states.The deal has been received with mixed reactionWhile some groups praised the Green New Deal’s unveiling — including some 2020 Democratic hopefuls — not all are on board with the approach.Progressive groups have criticized the effort for a lack of concrete actions within the resolution itself. The deal sets forth worthy and ambitious goals, those critics have said, but the climate crisis needs concrete legislation.“We urgently need a bold and ambitious Green New Deal that tackles fossil fuels head-on,” Wenonah Hauter, the executive director of the progressive environmental non-profit Food \u0026amp Water Watch, told ABC News. “We support the ambition and scale of this resolution, and we are heartened by its recognition that climate change poses a grave threat to healthy food and clean water, but any legislation that does not explicitly address the urgent need to keep fossil fuels in the ground is insufficient”.green new dealOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And while a pro-military party had been expected to win the vote, analysts said there would now be serious questions over whether anyone could practically campaign against a member of the royal family.For exclusive articles, events and an advertising-free read for just Start your free trialWith an Independent Minds subscription for just Start your free trialWithout the ads – for justStart your free trial“This is a profound development,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political analyst at Chulalongkorn University, which abruptly made the princess’s Thai Raksa Chart party a “leading contender”. Her decision to enter politics would “shape the contours and dynamics of Thai politics before and after the election”, he told Reuters.With an active Instagram account and past roles in several popular Thai movies, 67-year-old Princess Ubolratana is unlike any other Thai royal.

Criticism of the royals is a criminal offence and has been punishable by harsh jail terms, particularly since the military junta took over in 2014.Preempting the struggle it will face competing against a princess, one pro-military party has already lodged a complaint against Thai Raksa Chart for fielding her as its candidate.Paiboon Nititawan, the leader of the minor People\u0027s Reform Party, handed a letter to the Election Commission calling on it to decide whether to invalidate the nomination.He said nominating Princess Ubolratana could breach the law that prevents political parties from using the monarchy for campaigning.The current prime minister, Prayuth Chan-ocha, who led the 2014 coup that ousted Thailand\u0027s last elected government, on Friday accepted his selection as candidate to lead the next government by Palang Pracharat Party, widely considered a proxy for the military.\u0026nbspThailand set to hold first general election since 2014 military coup People scramble for free beer after truck overturns in ThailandSaudi teen who fled to Thailand deletes Twitter \u0027after death threats\u0027Footballer \u0027tortured for criticism of Bahrain royal family\u0027 arrestedI am not aiming to extend my power but I am doing this for the benefit of the country and the people, he said in an official statement.Thailand has undergone 12 military coups since its constitution was drawn up in 1932, one of which threw out the elected government of telecommunications tycoon Thaksin in 2006.He has lived in self-imposed exile since 2008, but has retained plenty of support since his populist policies won two landslide elections in 2001 and 2005.During his time in power, Thaksin was seen as aggressively courting good relations with Princess Ubolratana\u0027s brother, now the king, and friendship with the princess herself.That’s despite the military and its affiliated parties portraying Thaksin as being less supportive of the monarchy.\u0026nbspIn 2016, two years after it ousted a government led by Thaksin’s sister Yingluck Shinawatra, the military moved to amend the constitution in a way that would ensure it would be impossible for Thaksin’s family to return to power.But with a princess on the pro-Thaksin side, “previous assumptions and scenarios have to be reconsidered”, analyst Thitinan said. Thai Raksa Chart is an off-shoot of the main pro-Thaksin Pheu Thai party that was led by prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra.“If this turns out well, it will be a process of reconciliation and unity,” Thitinan said. “If this does not turn out well, it will pose alarming risk and even greater risk for Thailand\u0027s political future.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Now the EU “shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union”.May made a speech in Belfast on February  reinforcing the idea that there will be no hard border on the Irish island.Theresa May announced on January  that a vote on her EU Withdrawal deal will take place on Tuesday, January , which was rejected  to .May has guaranteed MPs a vote on whether the controversial Brexit backstop is triggeredthe UK fails to conclude a new trade deal with the EU by the end of next year.She unveiled her plan B Brexit plan on January  and vowed to have another go with solving the issue of the backstop.The EU has not changed their stance on re-negotiating the deal and to re-negotiate the backstop.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Crawford Falconer, an ex-World Trade Organisation ambassador, was recruited by the Brexit department for precisely these skills.Indeed, he is the ONLY person in the Government machine who has ever negotiated a trade deal.Yet bafflingly, Mrs May is keeping this star player on the sidelines.Instead, she will fly to Brussels with Whitehall mandarin Olly Robbins, the pro-EU fanatic who plunged Britain into the backstop trap she is now under pressure to escape from.Robbins hates Brexit and has privately warned the PM this is Mission Impossible.Mrs May — herself a Remainer who has never grasped the case for Brexit — will be joined by trusted “deputy PM” David Lidington, a dyed-in-the-wool Brussels worshipper.In such company, even the inclusion in her team of a thundering Brexiteer Attorney-General Geoffrey Cox is only mildly reassuring.Mrs May is notoriously stubborn. She can also be devious.After nearly three years, even her closest political colleagues — who can be counted on one hand with a couple of missing digits — have no idea what her Brexit might look like.Voters are increasingly irritated by this foot-dragging.Why should we remain part of an organisation that wants to punish us by stealing Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and our car industry Nobody who watched the brutal humiliation of poor little Greece will be surprised. This tragic and insolvent nation should never have been admitted to the EU, still less the Eurozone.Only with the assistance of US banking giant Goldman Sachs — “The Vampire Squid” — got them in under the wire. Once inside, they launched a borrowing and spending binge which ended in tears in the  crash.Greece might have flourished as a cheap but lovely tourist economy. Instead, it is now being cruelly tormented by Brussels and lumbered with multi-billion euros debts it can never repay.Greece symbolises all that is wrong with arrogant Brussels — the catastrophic Euro, inflexible economic policies and mass unemployment for under-s.Above all, there is the sneering contempt of unsackable Eurocrats for the million people they rule from subsidised ivory towers.Theresa May is a poor negotiator who never truly believed No Deal is better than a bad deal.Without this implicit threat, Brussels will give little and demand much in . It would be a pleasure to eat my words and watch Mrs May play a blinder.She can use her good luck to land a historic victory. Or she can blink and condemn Britain to colony status, paying billions more into EU coffers while being led by the nose on trade deal promises that never materialise.In which case, forget about that snap election fantasy.The Conservative Party would never be forgiven by the .million voters who voted Brexit — or those who wish they had.SECURITY CHIEFS are dusting off Cold War plans anticipating a Soviet nuclear strike to whisk the Queen to safety in the event of . . .  er . . . a No Deal Brexit.Presumably The Mall will be cleared of traffic and used as a landing strip to fly Her Maj out before revolutionary Remainers string her up for supporting Brexit.The only question is whether she will go quietly.The royals refused to leave London even after Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Second World War.This Project Fear nonsense is even more insane than the idea that thousands will die of fruit shortages.To quote Corporal Jones: “Don’t panic!!”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You are nothing but a sperm donor.”Amber who stormed out of her home in Mansfield, Notts, in May  after being ordered to clean out a cool box. She was found hanged in a hedgerow three days later.A inquest into her death has heard claims the teenager was being emotionally abused at home and subjected to a series of draconian punishments – including being told to wash every pot in the kitchen - for undesirable behaviour.Mr Cook gave evidence to the Nottingham hearing on its ninth day after deciding to attend in person.It was originally only intended a statement from him would be read.He told coroner Laurinda Bower how he and Kelly met around  and had two children – Amber and a sibling, who can’t be named – before splitting on Christmas Eve , when he moved out of the family home in Derbys.Mr Cook said he last saw his children in early , when Amber was , and took them for a meal in a pub. He claimed she was happy and cheerful – until he said he had to take her home.Asked by Ms Bower why that was the final time he saw them, Mr Cook replied: “My shts were all over the place.“I tried to ring Kelly and said I would be off this week, and Kelly said I could not see them at the drop of a hat.“I would ring and it would be, ‘we are going here’, or ‘we are going there’.“Every time I phoned her it would be ‘inconvenient’. There would be ‘family business’ to see to, or ‘we are taking them here, or there’.“The last time was a heated discussion. It was getting to the point where you are beaten down by it. I wanted to see the children.”Mr Cook said that during their last conversation, Kelly told him: “You just can’t see them when you want to.”The inquest heard he considered talking to a solicitor, but didn’t feel he had a leg to stand on.At some point around March , he went to their home – but found it was empty.Mr Cook said: “I went to a friends’ house on the estate, but they said that one morning they woke up and they had upped and gone. I had no idea where they’d gone.”He added the next contact he had with the Peats was on the day after Amber disappeared.Mr Cook told the hearing: “I found out in Facebook so I tried to contact Kelly with the number off the missing person posters.“I got vile abuse off Danny – ‘she is not your f****** daughter, she wants nothing to do with you, you are nothing but a sperm donor.“I phoned back again and spoke to Danny’s mum. I didn’t get much information. I was in deep shock about it.”He added he didn’t know about any issues surrounding his daughter that the inquest had heard about, including her running away from home previously and problems at school.His mum Jenner Lancaster – Amber’s grandmother – told the hearing her granddaughter was a lovely, sweet, lovable child who liked to cuddle and play silly girly things like dressing up, and with her make-up bag.Mrs Lancaster said she saw Amber quite frequently when she was young – but when her son and Kelly split up she only saw her two or three times before her death.One of the occasions was Valentines’ Day in , when Danny wanted to cook Kelly a romantic meal and the children went to stay with her for the weekend.But Mrs Lancaster said Amber was weepy because she had overheard a conversation between Kelly and her mum, Dianne Gillibrand, in which they had said she wouldn’t want them.Mrs Lancaster said: “I told them I would always want them. How can you not want two little children like that, that give you so much pleasure “It struck me as odd.”Mrs Lancaster next saw the young siblings on Mother’s Day , but they couldn’t stop for long because Kelly was waiting in her car outside. She gave them a pair of charm bracelets, and expected to see them again before she went into hospital that April for a knee operation – but never did.She told the hearing: “I got a message from Kelly to say they loved the bracelets, and that was it.“I bought them Easter eggs and sent a message to seethey would be coming for them. And I wanted to get Amber a birthday present because I was going in hospital. But the messagewas, ‘don’t know, not sure’. That was it.”Mrs Lancaster added that she went to the family home in a bid to see them – but found they had moved.When she contacted Kelly to ask for the new address – only to be told: “I am not comfortable with you having it.”She said: “I thought, ‘this is really strange’, but that is the way it was.”Mrs Lancaster found out Amber had gone missing through her sister, and panicked. She said she had no concerns about her granddaughter’s behaviour, and what had happened came as a shock.Referring to the Peats, she said: “They trust you with their kids and then stop you seeing them, and the next thing you know she is missing.“It’s horrible, it really is horrible.The inquest continues."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/VP-MAP-USA1.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"booming sounds shake houses america experts baffled","story":"Experts have been left baffled by a spate of seismic booms from Arizona to New York that appear to have gathered pace over the past week.The string of phenomena was first reported last Thursday morning when locals in three separate Tennessee counties reported hearing loud booming noises.On the same day, North Carolinians contacted police reporting unexplained loud blasts and booms that kept them awake at night.Two homeowners said the booms were so powerful that they briefly lost power as a result of the tremors, Mysterious Universe reported.Similarly unexplained explosions have been reported happening in isolation over the past years, but rarely with this frequency.On Saturday, loud bangs were reported in Rhode Island, where Jeremy Brazas doorbell captured a video and audio of a loud noise over a three minute period.The whole house shook, he told TurnTo.

I know we are meant to fan our faces and ask Nurse to bring us something to soothe our nerves after that nasty man uttered such a frightful insult.But I couldn’t help laughing at toothless Tusk’s tirade.At last, a European Union bigshot has blurted out his contempt for British voters.That’s surely preferable to all those smarmy smiles and fake phrases about “respect for each other’s values” and how we hope to work with “our European friends and partners”. Real friends don’t nick £billion off you.There are two things worth knowing about Donald Tusk. The first is that in his youth he was a bit of a brawler.The ­second is that five years ago he resigned as Polish prime minister to take up his current cushy number in ­Brussels.Born in , Tusk grew up in the city of Gdansk, when Poland was a grimy ­colony of the USSR. His family had ­German roots and his dad, a carpenter, died when Donald was . It can’t have made for an easy youth.Gdansk gave rise to the Solidarity trade union ­movement which protested against Iron Curtain suppression.Tusk has recalled that in his youth he was “a typical hooligan” who would ­saunter along the streets in a gang, ­“cruising for a bruising”.In some ways, who can blame him  They were edgy days and young men will do what young men have done since time immemorial: Defend themselvesunder attack. Communism wasa ­stinking and ruinous creed.Decent Poles bravely reasserted their national sovereignty after too many decades of being governed by ideological bureaucrats who couldn’t give a fig about the electorate.Er, remind you of anything, Mister ­Eurocrat That colourful background in the Gdansk of the s and s made it all the odder when, in , Tusk quit the premiership of his country to become an EU grand fromage.He had been Poland’s PM for seven years and the country had done well.Yet he chucked that in so that he could succeed shrivelling nonentity ­Herman Van Rompuy as president of the European Council.The job is less important than it sounds. Its occupant basically acts as a collector of opinions from EU heads of government and acts as their representative at ­international shindigs.That it was held by such a blinky-eyed vole as Van Rompuy was a measure of its signicance. Yet Tusk chucked in the prime ministership of his country for it!Brussels may offer wonderful pensions, top-trough brasseries and as many rides in the back of a BMW  Series as you could wish, but had Tusk gone mad The answer to that question is “not ­necessarily”. He saw that under EU rules, national governments are now increasingly junior to the federal superpower.The real power in Brussels lies not with Tusk, nor even with boozy European ­Commission president Jean-Claude ­Juncker, but with the backroom officials such as Martin Selmayr and Sabine ­Weyand.

So she got some of her gang to speak out for her.An “LA friend” quoted is widely thought to be her Pilates guru Heather Dorak. A “close confidante” is most likely Benita Litt, whose two daughters were royal bridesmaids.The “former co-star” can be identied as Suits actress Sarah Rafferty, while the “former colleague” could be actress Janina Gavankar.Meg, , and Harry, , were at Draper’s Hall, in London, where the Duchess took to the podium to hand out awards to those who, despite le-changing injuries, accidents or illnesses, have excelled in a sporting or adventure challenge.But the most interesting quotes — tearing into Meghan’s dad and her half-siblings Thomas and Samantha — come from a “long-time friend”, most likely her Northwestern University pal Lindsay Jill Roth.Meanwhile close pal and tennis star Serena Williams posted to Twitter a cryptic photo of herself with a cuppa, captioned: “Sips tea.”“Sipping the tea” is US slang for enjoying the gossip. The post was Serena saying: “I’m loving watching this play out.”Meghan has a press team at Kensington Palace, who also work for Harry, William and Kate. She could have issued something though them — but left them blindsided instead.Not since the chaotic days of the War of the Wales’s between Charles and Diana has a senior royal spun their own PR.William who lived through rival briefings, made it clear it could never happen again. But the press team didn’t even know about the Meghan story.When an American TV producer called and asked about the piece on Wednesday, their response was. “What article ”In the People cover story and ensuing coverage around the globe, Meghan is painted as a cross between Mother Teresa, Mary Berry, Grace Kelly and a Stepford We.She cooks, she loves her dogs, she’s the bestest friend in the world, she’s never had a relationship with the half-siblings who cashed in — and she did reach out to her dad.But the lies, untruths and “global bullying” against her has left her pals worried the “emotional trauma” could harm her baby, due in April.Diana was a renegade and used the press effectively. But it drove her team to distraction.Meghan, as an actress, also knows how to court good publicity. A royal source said: “She thought, why didn’t her team deny reports and speak out for her  Why was the narrative of Kate versus Meghan allowed to take hold “The fallings-out were more with William and Harry. She and Harry think many of their team are kids.”That is probably why Meghan has been trying to shut down negative stories herself — even via a magazine that had ‘Duchesses at War’ as a December cover. But it has a large US audience and she wants the message out quickly.However, as her press team know, the story has only brought the debacle with her dad back into the spotlight.There’s no doubt Meghan is a breath of fresh air for the British monarchy.But the mantra that has ensured the Queen rises above the ebb and flow of popular opinion is: “Never complain, never explain.”Meghan now needs to take aleaf out of her book.FORMER US actress Meghan has an intensely loyal circle of close pals. Many live in America but she regularly calls, texts and Skypes them.A number have spoken out to defend her “elegance, grace and philanthropy”. Here, we take a look at who they could be...Pilates instructor Heather Dorak lives in Los Angeles and is pregnant with her second child.Meghan said: “She’s amazing — as an instructor, as a friend, she is inspiring in every way.” She added her workouts are “the best”.Sarah Rafferty, , starred as Donna Paulsen on the TV drama Suits.Meghan played paralegal Rachel Zane. Sarah is also mum to two daughters aged  and seven.The glamorous Janina Gavankar, , bumped into Meghan in LA on acting jobs.Meghan trusts her so much she authorised her to speak to media before the royal wedding last year.After a career as an entertainment lawyer, Benita Litt founded an ethical bag company and vitamins firm.She has joined fashion fan Meghan at a number of charity events.Lynsay Jill Roth, , who is an author, met Meghan at Northwestern University.She based a character on the Duchess-to-be in her  novel What Pretty Girls Are Made Of.Fashion designer Misha Nonoo, , used to be married to Harry and Will’s mate Alexander Gilkes.She helped introduce Meghan to her royal husband-to-be. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Personally, I didn’t.What I hope we’re all agreed on, though, is the fact that Danny’s too busy playing Danny Dyer, the professional geezer, to be a good listener or natural TV historian.It’s an act that worked, of course, when he was wondering, “Eleanor of Aquitaine, was she a looker ” but didn’t serve him so well when presented with a longbow.“Long, innit ”The Beeb clocked this before production started, obviously, so had paired him up with dozens of head-patting historians and actors who got him to dress up as every kind of medieval t**t you can imagine. Like Mr Benn on crack, it was.Armour, codpieces, nappies, tights, doublet and hose, and a gigantic white smock, bleached with human urine, which had one grovelling “courtier” wondering: “Has all the p*** been washed out, my Lord King ”A good question.We didn’t actually get the answer, though, until part two, on Wednesday, when, after a brief detour round his ancestors, Louis IX of France, William the Conqueror and Henry II, viewers got to the nub of things, with Professor Chris Given-Wilson explaining the agonising death of Edward II: “By thrusting a hollow instrument, like the end of a trumpet, up his fundament.”“’Old on a minute,” said a rattled Danny. “He’s been stabbed  With a trumpet ”“Into his fundament.” Long pause.“Don’t tell me it’s up his a**e ”Right up it, Danny, with a red-hot poker. News which didn’t just do his “nut in”, it seemed to derail the entire documentary.They ran out of direct royal ancestors shortly afterwards as well, and the BBC adopted its stupid default setting in such circumstances. It turned Danny’s Right Royal Family into a dance and cookery show, complete with demonstrations of both, from medieval experts.It was about this time I also sussed out what was going on in the background, with all those winsome historians. An audition.The BBC was using it to find its new face of history, though why any of the blokes turned up is a mystery. Auntie’s already made it clear: “The days of white, middle-aged men explaining stuff are over.”Danny, on the other hand, can be tolerated, because he’s their new performing Cockney. A novelty act who can be dressed up and patronised so much he ended this one doing some weird medieval can-can, with his family, in front of his lost ancestral pile.A trumpet wasn’t quite shoved up his fundament as they danced, but the p*** had very much been washed out of him, my Lord King.GREAT TV lies and delusions of the month. “I think it’s going to be a really great show.” Cheryl Tweedy, The Greatest Dancer.“We do TV shows and we’re national treasures.” Jedward, Celebrity Coach Trip.“People will remember my name and I love that.” Some t**t off Ship- wrecked.IF you’re to take anything from the news experts have claimed Monday, January  was the most depressing day of the year, it’s probably the fact the experts clearly never sat through what happened eight days later, on Tuesday, January .Britain’s Top  Dogs Live: .

Lord Bob Kerslake sounded the drastic alert today as he demanded Theresa May rule out No Deal, call a second referendum - and stop a disaster.It comes after Mrs May faced more deadlock despite talks in Brussels yesterday with just  days left to Brexit. She will only meet EU chiefs again later in the month after they rebuffed her bid to reopen the -page Brexit deal. Instead they expressed a preference for Jeremy Corbyns customs union plan instead. Mrs May will head to Dublin tonight for dinner with Irish Premier Leo Varadkar. But already, the crossbench peer said, many officials are now spending signicant time preparing for riots instead of the jobs theyre paid to do.  He told the BBC: Its unnecessary. The government could stop this now.I think they could say we think, as many of the cabinet have already said privately, that no deal Brexit is simply not a realistic or viable option.We shouldnt be preparing for riots in the streets, which is what we are doing at the moment. I have to tell you there are many civil servants and local government workers spending signicant time not on the jobs theyre paid to do but actually preparing for this possibility.   Radio  interviewer John Humphrys suggested the warning was an exaggeration.But Lord Kerslake, who has advised the Labour Party since departing as Head of the Home Civil Service in , said: Its undoubtedly happening, trust me on this.The peer predicted the March  date of Brexit will be delayed and said it was wrong to think somehow or other the Brexit nightmare will endwe leave on the th. It will not. He said Parliament is nowhere near ready to pass all the necessary laws to leave on time. He added: Its not a natural disaster outwith the control of the government. A huge amount of quite unnecessary fear is being created amongst the public.  In a report published by the Peoples Vote campaign for a second referendum today, Lor Kerslake said there was no clarity about key elements of Britains future relationship with the EU. He said the proper ing of government required a proper understanding of how issues such as the future regulation of air travel and drugs, the sharing of data and criminal records, and co-operation on tackling climate change would be dealt with in future. Britain is ided, directionless and hurtling towards a legal deadline, with no idea where we will end up after we cross it, he said. A responsible government should now acknowledge our predicament: we are not ready to embark on a journey when we do not know where we will end up. We should not leave until and unless we know where we are going. If we do, the only certainty is that the resources, energy and talent of our country will be consumed by Brexit for many more years to come. The nightmare will not end. It will simply take on another form. A blindfold Brexit that offers no clarity can never provide closure. It means the arguments about Brexit will just go on and on.

They said the Government’s strategy to get people off the streets is not ambitious enough, and falls well behind the public’s desire to solve the issue. Tory MP Will Quince backed our demand for an extension to the Housing First scheme, which provides mental health and addiction support as well as housing. He said: “If we don’t address the underlying causes of homelessness then getting someone a home may not solve the problem.”  Labour MP Neil Coyle displayed yesterday’s Mirror front page telling of “Britain’s shame” as he spoke in the debate. He said our “fantastic campaign deserves credit for humanising what can be a bit of a statistical debate, when actually these are real people’s lives in devastating circumstances”. MPs agreed the Government lacked ambition with its target to halve rough sleeping by  and end it by . That timeframe is “too long” and it must be “far more ambitious”, said Mr Quince, who co-chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group for Ending Homelessness with Mr Coyle.  And Labour’s Lyn Brown said even that target will not be met at the current rate of progress. Rough sleeping fell by % last year but rose in big cities including London and Manchester. Ms Brown said: “At % a year it’s going to take until  to deal with rough sleeping and that’s not good enough.” Shadow Housing Minister Melanie Onn said: “In five years’ time we will be back to where we were in .” The Housing First approach, which has been successful in Scotland, is being piloted in Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, and the Liverpool area to help , rough sleepers and those at risk of ending up on the streets.  As well as secure housing, the system involves support to help rough sleepers recover from any mental health or substance misuse issues, and to sustain their tenancies. Mr Quince said: “We know this works because we’ve seen it work around the world in particular in Scandinavia where they’ve seen an eradication of rough sleeping entirely.” Mr Coyle highlighted the case of a woman in his Bermondsey and Old Southwark constituency in South London who was “sleeping with someone dferent every night so she wouldn’t have to go back to an abusive relationship or sleep on the streets”.  But he insisted that, despite the complexity of homelessness, the issue is solvable and that the public are ahead of the Government in demanding change. He added: “The two truisms from all the cases I see are that no circumstances have been anything other than tragic, but all of them have been avoidable. The public interest in solving homelessness isn’t matched by government action.” Blaming the Tories’ welfare policy and cuts for the problem, he said: “If only as much effort went into tackling this problem as creating it.” Tory MP Peter Aldous said an assessment must be made into any link between homelessness and the controversial roll-out of Universal Credit .  He also called for long-term funding for services and a “dramatic increase in the amount of affordable housing”. There are now . million children in poverty in private rented homes, the National Housing Federation has revealed – up % from . Almost , of these children would be lted out of povertythey were living in social housing. Homelessness Minister Heather Wheeler said: “Ensuring that everyone has a decent, affordable, secure home is a core priority for this government.” She insisted the Government’s target is “actually an ambitious target but it’s essential that we achieve it”.

Ruby - a Hungarian Vizsla - had cheekily stolen two brownies which contained Xylitol, a form of sweetener, which is toxic to dogs and can cause liver failure when consumed. Ruby fell ill within  hours leaving owner Kate Chacksfield, from Acton, West London, heartbroken.And despite spending pound, in a bid to save her le, Ruby died aged seven on October . Kate, , is now sharing her story to raise awareness for the dangers of dogs consuming natural sweeteners. The media and presentation coach said: I only made brownies with Xylitol in to reduce the amount of sugar I was eating. But while I was out, Ruby managed to get into the container off the side in the kitchen and eaten a couple.  She seemed fine at first and it wasnt until a couple of days later she began being violently ill and I took her to the vets. I had no idea how serious eating natural sweeteners was for dogs, the photos of her on le support still make me cry. Weve had her since she was a puppy and Im completely lost without her. Kate claims Ruby had stolen the chocolate brownies in the past and claims the vet had stated small amounts of chocolate arent too harmful to dogs her size. Following previous experiences - Kate wasnt too worried about Ruby this time until she began being sick. Kate said: Ruby began being violently sick so I rushed her to the vets so sent her home after checking her over.  But soon after she collapsed and we took her back as soon as possible - it was then they started treating her for rat poison because of her symptoms. We just thought she may have eaten some by mistake in the park or something - it never crossed my mind to mention the brownies. As Rubys condition began to deteriorate, she was taken to The Royal Veterinary College, London, but sadly died eight days later of liver failure and a suspected stroke. It wasnt until after Rubys death that vets askedshe may have consumed Xylitol which is when Kate realised her health deterioration was linked to the brownies. She said: I had absolutely no idea Xylitol was harmful to dogs what so ever and I was heartbroken when they told me and I knew it was too late for Ruby.  I really, really urge other dog owners to read up on the dangers of Xylitol in dogs and urgently take their pets to the vetthey accidentally consume it as it could be the dference between le and death. Xylitol sweetener can be found in many products such as sugar free sweets and gum, some baking mixes, peanut butters and chocolate. Kate says it takes just a quarter of a teaspoon to cause liver failure in dogs the size of a Labrador, and even less in smaller breeds. She said: We did everything we could to save Ruby - she was so loved and we all miss her dearly. We really had hope she would pull through so we were heartbroken when she didnt.  Wed love to be able to save other dogs from going through what Ruby went through by raising awareness on the dangers of Xylitol for dogs. It takes just a quarter of a teaspoon of sweetener to harm a dog. If anyone has any concerns they can the Animal PoisonLine for advice.

She and Pete Ames had only been dating for six months but both knew they had found “the one”. Then doctors said they were running out of ways to treat the blood cancer she’d been fighting for three years. And she would probably die within months. “I was told I was out of treatment options,” says Jo. “All the doctors could offer me was palliative care. “I pushed them for a timeframe and they told me it was unlikely I’d make it past Christmas. It was devastating. I wouldn’t reach my one-year anniversary with Pete.  “A few weeks later we were painting my bedroom and Pete burst into tears.

The disease can usually be cured with intensive chemotherapy and Jo gave up her job and moved in with her parents to focus on the treatment.  But she relapsed months later and over the next three years tried all shyavailable treatments. Nothing worked... Instead, the cancer spread to her lungs and bones. The pain was so severe Jo began suffering fits. She says: “When I was diagnosed, I felt like broken goods. I was a year out of university, embarking on my career and dating. I met Pete through a mutual friend, who told each of us what the other had been through. “We really clicked. He got everything. We knew this was something special. But our hopes were dashed when the doctors said they’d run out of options.” Pete proposed at his house, which he shydecorated with fairy lights. He even painted “I love you” on the walls in  languages. He quit his job in Birmingham to work for minimum wage in Manchester to be with Jo.  They hastily planned a wedding – finding an off-the-rack dress as they had no time to get one made. Jo says: “I was very frail, according to the doctors’ estimates I only had a month left. I had an IV drip I had to tape to the underside of my arm but it was an incredible day.” Pete says: “I’ve been to a lot of weddings but never one where there was so much love. Everyone was hugging each other.” Days before the wedding, Christie Cancer Hospital in Manchester told Jo her doctors had been given permission to give her a new drug, Brentuximab Vedotin, on compassionate grounds. It stopped the cancer progressing so well the NHS agreed to fund it for other patients, including  who went into remission and had le-saving stem cell transplants. Another drug Bendamustine, which is still not widely available on the NHS, sent Jo’s cancer into remission and she was able to have a transplant.  Jo says: “A year before my transplant we checked the donor register and there were no matches. By the time I was ready there was one. “We were terried he might not want to go through with it. We couldn’t speak to him directly but, thanks to Anthony Nolan, everything fell into place.” Jo spent a month in hospital during the London Olympics in  as her body was blasted with chemotherapy to wipe away the cancer, her bone marrow and her white blood cells to try to stop her body rejecting the transplant. Pete, a business consultant, says: “The worst moments were sitting at home after leaving Jo at the hospital, eating dinner at pm and thinking, ‘If the transplant doesn’t work, this is what’s left. Our bed felt so empty. There were a lot of tears.” The nightmare nearly became a reality... Jo says: “You are pushed very close to death during the transplant. You are being sustained by blood transfusions. There was one night where I felt something give way in my body. I hit rock bottom. I knewI chose, I could pass away quietly. But underneath that was another thought, ‘No, push through one more night.’ I had to keep trying for Pete and my parents. The next day my blood counts started to rise ever so slowly.” Recovery was tough. Jo suffered graft versus host disease, which can be fatal, as her body struggled to accept the transplant. It was  months before she was able toto regular work for the first time in five years. She took up track cycling and, after doctors gave her the all-clear, she ran the London Marathon on her rd birthday last April. The couple also discovered it might be possible for them to have a baby, despite Jo being left infertile by chemotherapy, as her womb was undamaged. They used Pete’s sperm and a donor egg but were left with just one embryo to implant. Jo says: “One of our friends said they thought it would work because we do pretty well when the odds are against us. “After years of having no future to plan for, we’re planning how to raise our daughter. She is the best gt – the gt of love we thought we’d never have.”Find out more about the Anthony Nolan charity at www.anthony nolan.org"},{"url":null,"title":"harry hints meghan markles baby","story":"NewsHarry hints Meghan Markles baby will take important record from Prince LouisThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex were pictured cradling the baby bump at the annual Endeavour Fund Awards at Drapers Hall tonightShareCommentsByBradley Jolly:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video harry-meghan-attend-servicemen-awards-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPrince Harry tonight revealed he and Meghan Markle are expecting a heavy baby.

Vlad Luca Filat funded his extravagant lestyle for years using cash which vanished from three banks. The -year-old is the son of Moldovas jailed former prime minister, Vladimir Filat, who was jailed for nine years in June  for his part in a fraud worth pound million [billion], an eighth of Moldovas GDP. Now Filat Jr, who moved to posh Knightsbridge, London, as a student in July , must hand British authorities nearly pound, thought to be from the fraud. The National Crime Agency said Filat Jr paid pound, up front to rent a flat in Cadogan Square, Knightsbridge, where the average house price is more than poundmillion.   In photos online, Luca can be seen enjoying trips abroad and popping Champagne at pool parties in St Tropez, in the south of France.One image shows his leaning on a Mercedes jeep in a snowy region.Police investigated the student and found three HSBC bank accounts were funded by money from overseas companies, mainly based in Turkey and the Cayman Islands. Cash deposits, including pound, across three days, were also made into these accounts. But Filat Jr, who had no registered income in the UK, has spent huge amounts of cash on luxury goods and services, including a pound, Bentley from a dealership in Mayfair, central London. Filat Jr must now hand authorities pound,. from the three HSBC accounts, which were frozen in May  under the Criminal Finances Act.  District Judge Michael Snow, sitting at the City of London Magistrates Court, said: I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the cash was derived from his fathers criminal conduct in Moldova. The NCA said the money will be passed to the UK Treasury but could eventuallyto Moldova. However the order does not prevent Filat opening another bank account which could receive more suspicious funds, a spokeswoman said. Rob MacArthur, from the NCA international corruption unit, added: Account Freezing Orders are a valuable tool in the fight against illicit finance in the UK.   Where we suspect money in an account is the proceeds of crime, we can apply to the court to freeze and then forfeit the sums.

Consulting rooms have been turned into bedrooms with salvaged beds and a kitchen with basic equipment. The old waiting room is now a lounge with sofas, a TV and even a pool table, all donated by the local community. When snow hit last week, the residents of the surgery were warm, safe and dry. Banners outside have renamed it the Saving People Homeless Project. The building, close to Eccles town centre, had been empty for nine years, but its residents now face eviction during the coldest month of the year. NHS Property Services says the premises are unsafe and the “building was broken into and occupied without our consent”.  An eviction notice served last Friday was only averted at the last minute when solicitors argued it would put the occupants’ lives at risk due to sub-zero temperatures. “The building was just sitting here,” says resident Steven Agnew. “Would the NHS rather have people in here taking care of the place, and themselves, or just freezing to death  If they get people out, we’ll be at the NHS’s door in one way or other.” Fellow resident Stacie Martindale lost her home after fleeing domestic violence, including kidnap. “I got into pound, of arrears even though I wasn’t living there,” she says. “Then the council said I’d made myself intentionally homeless. It was a choice between the street and a dangerous relationship.”  Her son is now living with his shygrandmother, but Stacie and her dog Kion had nowhere to go. She needs two things to feel safe – Kion and a lock on her bedroom door. Neither are possible in most hostels, but at the GPs’ surgery, she has both. Meanwhile, her room is full of the little touches that make a home – fairy lights above the donated sofa bed, side table and lamp, toiletries lined up on the window sill, an electric radiator, and a bed for Kion. “This is not a squat, it’s a community,” says Stacie, a former pub worker and labourer, while giving us a tour of the surgery. “I’ve been living in there for  weeks now and it’s made me feel human again. It’s better than living in a mixed dormitory. “A lot of people arrived with nothing more than a carrier bag – their lives carried in their two hands. “Now they’ve got their humanity again, a couple of changes of clothes, a bed, a few things taken out of a skip and a hot meal. There are wash basins in each room and there are toilets on each floor. “We’re getting results. We had a young care leaver living with us and now he’s got his own flat. We took him down the housing and got him sorted. But people are very anxious about the eviction. Panic set in on Thursday night and people started losing hope. We’ve won a reprieve but we don’t know for how long.”  Manchester is currently running a ground-breaking Bed For Every Night scheme, but it ends on March . Alec McFadden, from the nearby Salford Unemployed and Community Resource Centre, says residents hope the surgery could come to be included in the Manchester scheme, and that it could be continued beyond the end of March. Matthew, , suffers from schizophrenia and has been homeless for  months, even sleeping under a trailer in the snow before coming to the surgery. Above his bed, his spare clothes hang from a curtain rail. In the corner he has a microwave with a single potato and a bag of pasta. “This is somewhere I actually feel safe,” he says. Ashley Parker, , became homeless after struggling to pay rent on his agency job wages. He then lost his employment because he didn’t have washing facilities, but is now able to shower at the surgery. “They’ve said I can reapply, so let’s see,” he says. Another occupant, Dwayne, has a towel and spare jumper hanging from hooks in his room next to a neatly made double bed and TV.  “You can’t workyou can’t sleep and when you’re homeless you can’t get a good night’s sleep,” he says. “I’m thinking about work now that I’m not sleeping with one eye open any more.” A spokesman for NHS Property Services said it asked residents to vacate in November and that the Greater Manchester Combined Authority homeless team “at the time confirmed that there is alternative accommodation immediately available for the occupants”. They added: “Fire and Rescue Services have deemed this property unsafe for shyresidential use in its current form, therefore, we were left with little option other than to instruct our legal team to proceed with seeking shypossession.” The decision now lies in the hands of the courts and the NHS whether to work with residents or to evict vulnerable people onto the winter streets. “I’m not speaking out to get help, I’m speaking out to get heard,” Stacie says. “People have accused us of breaking into buildings, but really we’re saving people’s lives.” "},{"url":null,"title":"thousands nightclubs close young people","story":"NewsThousands of nightclubs close as young people ditch dancing for bars and gymsEXCLUSIVE: In the past decade the numbers have fallen from , UK to just ,, figures showShareCommentsByNadeem Badshah:,  FEB NewsRave nights may be a thing of the past as these days we prefer a pint and a chat\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRave nights may be a thing of the past as the number of clubs has fallen by , in a decade, according to research.

She said: I’m very shocked and disheartened by what we have gone through. We saved to buy our first house through shared ownership and looked at reviews and Bovis were five-star builders. Buying a house is the biggest debt we have ever been in. The fact it has taken two years to get to where we are now is a joke and we’re not the only ones.   We’ve never had a direct apology from Bovis they’ve never taken liability for what they have done. Adding: It has cost them pound, to rip our house apart and put it back together again.” The work saw their entire ceiling ripped out and two thirds of the upstairs joists replaced, but when the couple went to accept the keys to their ‘finished’ home early this year, they said it was anything but. Ashleigh said there was bubbled up plasterboard, sloppy paintwork, gaps around the front and back doors, the bathroom floor still sagged, there was poor patched rendering at the rear and an indoor adhesive had been used to stick paving slabs down. They have refused to move back in until the works have been carried out to a satisfactory standard. Ashleigh said: “My husband is a builder by trade and my brother is a carpenter so they know what the standards should be. This week they have pulled their finger out.   I was aware one of heads of Bovis was athouse yesterday so I went over and told him how unhappy I was and that we had been going around in circles because every job they complete they make four other jobs because it’s not done properly. “Originally they wanted us to move back in on December but when we viewed the property two days prior we still found so many problems that had not been sorted, but Bovis were pushing us to move in. “Last Saturday I took carpenter to look at our home and he had more of a snagging list than what there was two weeks prior.” The couple have still been paying council tax and standing charges for a house they don’t live in. Ashleigh said: “Bovis says they have been in contact with us constantly but that’s a lie. Communication has been terrible and they lost our snagging list eight or nine times. It’s not good enough, and it’s still not good enough so many other people are suffering. They need to be shamed as it’s not right. I’ve not met a happy customer yet.” A spokesman for LiveWest said: “We have been working with Bovis Homes to bring the matter to a swt conclusion and have been in regular contact with the customers to ensure they are fully up to date with the current situation.” A Bovis spokesman said: “The absolute priority of our regional team is to deliver a quality home for Mr and Mrs Pow and LiveWest, and we apologise their customer journey with us has not been up to the standard we strive for since they moved in two years ago. “The team has been in regular communication with Mr and Mrs Pow and LiveWest to progress the works, although the current dispute has meant our contractors had to delay carrying out the work inside the home. “We are pleased to say the final interior work has now been complete and repair of the exterior render, hampered due to adverse weather, has been resolved and now requires painting. “We have welcomed hundreds of happy customers to our popular Water’s Edge location, and while we strive to deliver a home of the highest quality, with any newly-built property there can sometimes be items that need to be addressed. “We are sorry this has caused so much disruption for Mr and Mrs Pow, but we will continue to work closely with them, LiveWest and our contractors to ensure a successful resolution.” "},{"url":null,"title":"young woman just weeks live","story":"NewsYoung woman with just weeks to live reveals her heartbreaking final wishGeorge Compton, of Cobham, Surrey, has battled lung disease all her le and now her time could be running outShareCommentsByJane LavenderErin Cardf:,  FEB NewsGeorge has been told she may have just weks to live \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email George Compton has been told she could have just weeks to live after her body rejected a potentially lesaving transplant . The -year-old, of Cobham, Surrey, has battled cystic fibrosis all her le.She was thrown a leline when she had a double lung transplant in August . But, tragically, in December , Georges body started rejecting the organs and she contracted a series of infections. Medics have told her she could have just weeks to live - and George has just one, final heartbreaking wish.   She is taking time out from planning her own funeral to beg people to sign up to become organ donors.And despite now being treated in hospital George only wants to thank the donor who gave her the new lungs and their family for the extra time the extra time the transplant has given her.Speaking from her hospital bed in Greater Londons Hillingdon Hospital she said: Not long ago, doctors warned that I could have just weeks to live. Since then, it’s been very up and down, but I’m getting stronger, especially mentally. “If the worst does happen, I have come to terms with it. I’ve nearly finished planning my funeral. I just have some letters to finish to family members and family to say goodbye. “But I’ve had the most amazing le. I am so grateful for everything it has brought me, and everyone that has come in and out of it.   “I can honestly say I will die the happiest girl ever and look back and say, ‘Yeah you know what, I made the most of that.’ “If the worst does happen, I want my legacy to be that I lived, I loved, and I did it all with a smile on my face.” Georges inspiring words come as campaigners are calling for a resolution to an ongoing price dispute with pharmaceutical company Vertex, manufacturer of CF drug Orkambi, which has shown in clinical trials to slow the decline of lung , thus extending the le of patients. Cystic fibrosis patients and their families have implored the government to step in and override Vertex’s patent, to allow other companies to create the drug cheaper. Diagnosed with cystic fibrosis - a genetic condition causing the lungs to become clogged with sticky mucus making it dficult to breathe - when she was a baby, George is a member of Share Your Wishes, a group of transplant recipients, live donors and families of donors. They are all fighting to ensure that people disclose their decision to be organ donors to their loved ones, to help facilitate more donations.  In and out of hospital for the majority of her childhood, George was placed on the transplant list at , when her right lung collapsed. Briefly taking herself off when she began to respond brilliantly to the drug Kalydeco, she was listed once again in September , by which time she required round-the-clock oxygen. George says the lng transplant saved her le. She explained: “My health, up until now, has been amazing. All I wanted to do was make my donor proud of me and to live le happily with good lungs. “It’s the small things you take for granted,you’ve never been able to do them and, after my transplant, I could go on walks with my friends, get a full-time job, climb the O and hike Orrest Head in the Lake District, which I did seven weeks post-transplant.  “Most importantly, I’ve been able to use my story to promote organ donation in a positive light.” One of the highlights of her le was meeting her donors family after exchanging letters with them through a transplant co-ordinator to ensure she stuck to strict anonymity rules. George said: “Meeting them was incredible and overwhelming at the same time. “I’d have loved to have known my donor as a person, as I think we matched very well, but I want to say thank you for every second I’ve had with these lungs. “I’ve not only been given more time with my family and friends, but good health to enjoy, which I never did growing up.” Things changed dramatically for George in mid-December last year when she was struck down with a chest infection.  Hospitalised over Christmas, she was only allowed home for a lunch with her family on Boxing Day. She was soon breathless and exhausted - signs of rejection which, according to the NHS, can occur when the body sees a new organ as a threat and produces antibodies against it. At Harefield Hospital, George was pumped full of steroids and antibiotics, but was determined to be out of hospital by New Year’s Eve. She said: “I planned to get myself home as I had, unfortunately, been in hospital on Christmas Day. “On Boxing Day, I woke up not feeling  per cent, but had a shower, some painkillers and got all dressed up for lunch with my family. “When I got to their house, I remember saying I was going to quickly pop upstairs, but walking just  steps left me struggling to breathe. My family noticed and even had to say to me, ‘George, get your breath,’ as I was still chatting away, and am so stubborn that I never know when to acknowledge when I need to stop.”  She was taken back to hospital after lunch and Georges condition deteriorated over the next few days. Her temperature soared and antibiotics and painkillers stopped working. George said: “I remember messaging my mum as she was at work saying something wasn’t right.” She was put on oxygen and eventually moved to the high dependency unit as she continued to deteriorate. George said: “Then, it felt like it all went really quickly. My temperature was raging and my oxygen levels were dropping. I was getting really unwell.” Sadly, she didnt make it home from hospital by New Year’s Eve as planned. Instead, by January  doctors were warning her family that her lungs, by now irreparably scarred by a string of infections, and her body rejecting them, might need to prepare for the worst.  George said: “They said I had days. Even hours. I survived because I’m strong-willed, but I was in a dangerous situation.” After that, George was transferred around ious dferent wards as medics assessed the extent of the damage, while her helpless loved ones waited to seeshe would pull through. Remarkably, she did – but her future is still uncertain, although doctors are doing all they can. Having made peace with the fact her time may run out, she hopes people will see her story as a positive one and that her words will now urge others to sign up as organ donors. George said: “I can take any news, so long as people are honest with me. I’m not scared of dying, but of leaving my loved ones. “I know things haven’t been great now, but I still want people to know that donating organs doesn’t just change the recipient’s le, it changes their family’s too. Evenit buys an extra six months, every moment is worth it. “I’ve had three and a half years because somebody said yes to giving me that chance. I didn’t want to die then, at . I had so much more to live for and I got to experience a le of breathing freely, which I could only have dreamed of. “If in doubt, ask yourself what you would doyou, or a loved one needed an organ.” A great supporter of the Share Your Wishes openness initiative, George wants everyone to let their loved ones know their desire to donate organs when they die. She added: “Have that conversation with your family. It’s not something people want to talk about, but making your wishes known makes that moment easier when the time comes. “It also gives so much comfort for a person to know their loved one has lived on in someone .”For more information, visit www.shareyourwishes ."},{"url":null,"title":"you should never leave your","story":"NewsWhy you should never leave your childs bedroom door ajar while they sleepA firefighter has shared some incredibly important advice for parents and revealed the one thing they should never doShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  FEB Updated:,  FEB NewsA firefighter has revealed why you should always close your childs door at night \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA firefighter has issued an important warning for parents that may help save lives in the future.

The billionaire, , took the unprecedented step of posting the allegations the US tabloid magazine said they were prepared to publish about himhis newspaper, the Washington Post, did not stop investigating them. The National Enquirer broke the story about Bezos relationship with Lauren Sanchez which, the tabloid claimed, was conducted behind his we’s back. The Amazon tycoon - the richest man in the world with a fortune of nearly billion - is currently splitting from we MacKenzie in the largest orce ever. In his post on medium, Bezos says he was allegedly threatened with the publication of nude photos of him and suggestive photos of Sanchez unless he publicly made a statement saying the magazine’s parent company American Mediawas never “politically motivated or influenced by political forces”. The magazine publisher is at the centre of a continuing controversy involving Donald Trump over the practice of “catch and kill,” in which stories were allegedly bought by the National Enquirer but never published to avoid embarrassing the President.   Bezos published the emails his lawyers had received from AMI after they wrote to them wanting to broker a deal. They allegedly approached Bezos after learning he had been conducting a private investigation into how it obtained his text messages between him and Sanchez. They tried to persuade him into shutting down the investigation because of the likelihood it may lead to more damning revelations about AMI’s “catch and kill” tactics and its political ties to Trump and other world leaders. The photos in question include a “full- body selfie of Bezos wearing just a pair of tight black boxer-briefs or trunks,” and a “naked selfie in a bathroom,” among others, according to a threatening email sent to the man Bezos hired to run the private investigation penned Dylan Howard, the chief content officer of AMI on February .   In a letter sent to Bezos lawyers, Jon P Fine - AMIs deputy general counsel - accused the Amazon tycoon of continuing defamatory activities. He said the Enquirers activities were consistent with applicable laws and wrote: American Media emphatically rejects any assertion that its reporting was instigated, dictated or influenced in any manner by external forces, political or otherwise. Simply put, this was and is a news story. Mr Fine said the Washington Posts reporters continue to pursue and to disseminate these  and spurious allegations in a manner that is injurious to American Media and its executives.

The small arcade had a sitting area in it so that’s where we were. We went with some friends and their children and we were letting the kids play together. My daughter all of a sudden ran over and said Ezra climbed into a game. Initially, I though oh like climbed on top of......but no. He climbed in the prize door of a large crane game. The door was pretty large and surprisingly easy to get into. We tried to get him out but the door would only go inwards, pushing into him. I got the restaurant employees and asked for them to get the key to the machine and let him out but they didn’t have a key.   The closest key was  hours away. We immediately called police and fire department and they had to take the top of the machine off and one fireman jumped in and pulled him out. As they waited for the fire brigade, Ky shot a video of Ezra playing with the toys inside, seemingly unphased. The cheeky tot was not harmed in the incident, but it didnt stop mum Ky from going into full mum meltdown mode. She told WALA: I was scared to death. My husband had to keep assuring me that he was ok and not in any real danger. I didn’t laugh until it was all over. It’s pretty funny now but definitely not then.  Afterwards the cheeky youngster was seen unwinding with his prize at the familys home. Ky said: I was panicked the whole time until he was in my arms again. He just has no fear. Little Ezra has become something of a celebrity since the incident, but we dont advise anyone trying this move out for themselves.

Its said they are being threatened with being sent to a re-education campthey refuse to take part.One resident told Radio Free Asia: “Kazakh people in Xinjiang have never [eaten pork]. Starting last year, some people have been forced to eat pork so they can celebrate a festival belonging to the Han Chinese.Pork and alcohol are strictly forbidden in Islam. Muslims, also known as Uyghurs, do not usually celebrate the lunar new year holiday, also called the Spring Festival.   Our main festivals are Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. Spring Festival is for Han Chinese and people who believe in Buddhism, If we wont put up the couplets or hang lanterns, they they say we are two-faced, and they send us to re-education camps, another resident said.  The celebration of Chinese festivals has roots in folk religion, which includes Buddhist images and artwork. But its claimed Chinese authorities have ordered all households in Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, Muslims included, to put new year decorations outside their homes. Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the exile group World Uyghur Congress, said: According to our information, the Chinese government is stepping up its campaign to assimilate Uyghurs into Han Chinese culture. They are forcing Uyghurs to celebrate Lunar New Year, to put up decorative couplets.  They are also forcing Uyghurs to drink alcohol, to show that they dont subscribe to extreme religious beliefs and dont disrespect traditional Chinese culture. Beijing initially denied the existence of re-education camps. But Shohrat Zakir, the chairman of the areas government, said in October that the facilities are an effective tool to protect the country from terrorism and provide vocational training for Uyghurs. In February last year, a previous report claimed Muslims in the same region had been forced to take part in new year celebrations.  These claims again included accusations Muslims ate food that was forbidden.It comes after government officials in the huge nation were caught on camera beating dogs - sometimes to death - on city streets.The gruesome torture in the Hangzhou area was a result of dog owners being banned from walking their pets from am to pm.

That happens with late goals but we still have to take confidence because it still was a good performance.“I came in two weeks ago and we had five new boys on the deadline.“They’ve only trained once so it was always going to be hard but in periods of the game you could see we can all play together and how it can come off.“Hopefully, we can show more of that in the upcoming games.“It’s always disappointing to concede a last-minute goal but I think the boys worked their socks off. The performance might not have been as good as against Motherwell and Hearts but every one of us certainly put everything in.“Unfortunately, a strike like that happens and you can’t do anything about it.”Despite only signing for the Dark Blues on January , Dales has already featured five times for the club and is set for his sixth turn-out in tonight’s clash at home to high-flying Kilmarnock.It’s been a non-stop start to le at Dens Park for the -year-old who is enjoying le already in the Scottish top flight and is hoping to experience his first victory in dark blue in just over  hours’ time.He added: “I think I’ve settled in quite well.“It’s definitely dferent up here, it’s a lot quicker, up and down all the time but I think that suits me.“That’s my game, to be dynamic, so I think it probably suits me more up here than down in League One.“I’ve only been here a couple of weeks and I’ve already played four-and-a-half games in two weeks.“Some of the others have played five so it has been pretty thick and fast butwe can put another good performance on again I think we can get the three points.“It’s a great opportunity to do that as long as we work as hard as we did on Saturday.

I actually don’t have any relatives here in Dundee because they all moved to America but I’m sure they will be over soon to watch me in person.”And the former DC United man admits being in an environment where the population live and breathe football is a special feeling.His grandad’s love of United and the fact dad John, a former USA skipper, spent a big chunk of his career in England, means that’s not come as a surprise.“Over here everyone talks about football all the time and it’s the culture. It’s everywhere, which I love, and it’s all over the city.“There are so many competing sports back in the US that are big but football is getting bigger and at the final this year in Atlanta you saw , people there and that is great to see. The game is going to keep growing there and you will see more and more players coming through but here it’s on a dferent level.“I knew what it was like over here, I got it from my dad from when he was here.

That got us the space to play and I think we got a bit away from that in the second half but it will come.“If we keep going and show our class we will finish off games a bit better.“I think, like the manager has said, there are a lot of good players who have good experience so when they get in, they just gel.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5c36d3189f97.74208600.jpg ","title":"gordon forest backs dundee united to carry on good form against st mirren","story":"Assistant head coach Gordon Forrest has hailed the “leadership” shown by Dundee United’s new recruits.Despite a large chunk of the club’s  new signings arriving on deadline day, manager Robbie Neilson’s assistant Gordon says players like Mark Reynolds, Mark Connolly, Calum Butcher and Peter Pawlett have already shown they’ve got the character to take the Tangerines to the next level.That level is the Premiership and they’ll get a taste of that this weekend when travelling to top-flight St Mirren on Saturday.And Gordon is backing the Tangerines to repeat the display in their - win over Morton last weekend.He said: “The new players didn’t have much contact with the staff and the other players but straight away you could see on the pitch they were right behind what we are trying to do as a club.“There was a good energy about the guys, they were passionate and a bit of leadership came out on the pitch as well. It was so pleasing to see how they slid into that game but also they’ve been on the training pitch this week and it seems like they’ve been here a while.“It can take time to bed in but we can’t have that with  games to go.“It was important we got players in with the right character and mentality and we knew they would fit in straight away.“It’s been great and credit to them for that but also credit to the players already here for reaching out and bringing them in.”The club are hoping for a sell-out of away tickets at St Mirren this week with , of their , allocation already taken up."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/02/5c5ac680eef516.84169022.jpg ","title":"tom duthie this is how good dundee uniteds 11 signings have been","story":"It’s still early days with Dundee United’s January signings but  of the  Robbie Neilson fixed up last month have already had game time.Today, therefore, the Tele takes a look at how they’ve done in their limited time so far and looks ahead to what Arabs can expect from their new men.Ross LaidlawThe goalie who has joined on loan from Hibs for the rest of the campaign is the one arrival fans have still to see in action. That could change in Saturday’s Scottish Cup visit to St Mirren and at the very least he will provide experienced cover for Benjamin Siegrist.Charlie SeamanIt was a dficult start for the Bournemouth kid as he made his debut in the defeat at Ayr United just hours after flying north to begin his loan. The -year-old, however, did reasonably well at Somerset Park and looked good as he made his home debut in Saturday’s win over Morton.Mark ReynoldsThe vastly-experienced Aberdeen defender showed his ability and know-how as he strolled through his debut against the Ton, despite injury meaning that was his first competitive outing since last May. Reynolds was handed the captain’s armband and showed leadership qualities that could prove vital in the coming months.Mark ConnollyThe arrival from Crawley Town is another centre-half and Saturday saw him show instant signs of being able to form a solid partnership with Reynolds. The Irishman is a no-nonsense defender who looks perfect for the physical requirements of the Championship.Calum ButcherBack for a second spell at United having previously played at Tannadice under Jackie McNamara, the midfielder was brought in to add bite in that area of the park. He lasted an hour at the weekend and in that time won his tackles and had a big influence on those around him in the middle of the park.Ian HarkesThe -year-old American was something of a surprise arrival but with his energetic box-to-box running has shown why Robbie Neilson wanted him. The former DC United team-mate of Wayne Rooney covered a lot of ground and, as he showed in the Scottish Cup win at Montrose, also has a goal in him.Morgaro GomisAnother who is ing to United, in his case for a third spell in tangerine. Gomis blotted his copy book by picking up a red card in that defeat at Ayr. Now , the  Scottish Cup winner is unlikely to start every game but will provide good cover in central midfield.Peter PawlettThe manager spent most of last month working to secure the services of the former Aberdeen man who played for him at MK Dons. Pawlett wasted no time showing why with a superb debut against Morton that saw him grab his first United goal. His pace, use of the ball and movement off it means he will be a very big player.Cammy SmithThe third of the arrivals who have played for United before. Smith has fitted in well since joining up from St Mirren. He goes about his work in quietly but his knowledge of how to win promotion from this ision makes him an asset.Aidan NesbittAnother who played for Neilson at MK Dons. The former Celtic kid has signed until the end of the season and so far only one of his five appearances have been as a starter. At , the attacker could be one for the future –he can add goals to the nice touches seen so far.Osman SowAnother ex-MK Don and the Swedish striker also played for Neilson during a successful spell at Hearts. The -year-old has had a lack of game time buthe can get his match fitness back quickly there is no question he has the ability to get goals in this ision."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"customers-overpaying-for-unused-mobile-data-7-ways-to-avoid-it","story":"MOST mobile customers on SIM-only deals are overpaying for unused data, Citizens Advice has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"alex-salmond-holyrood-committee-convened-by-linda-fabiani-must-show-no-bias","story":"MSPs have voted to establish a Holyrood committee to investigate the Scottish Governments handling of complaints against Alex Salmond."},{"url":null,"title":"anniesland-emergency-services-on-the-scene-at-muirkirk-drive","story":"POLICE Scotland has confirmed officers are at the scene of an incident in Anniesland."},{"url":null,"title":"brendan-rodgers-confirms-scott-bain-has-celtic-gloves-for-now","story":"Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers has confirmed that Scott Bain has the number one short at the Parkhead side for now.

It’s amazing how you can be enjoying it and then quickly go to not enjoying it.“I was at Dundee at the time and picked up a lot of injuries and wasn’t enjoying it at all.“I was going to go on-loan from Dundee, I’d spoken to my we and just said ‘listenI don’t enjoy my next spell I might retire from playing’.“That was just the way I felt at the time.“I’d had a bad spell, but thankfully I was going on-loan for six months and I picked the right club in Derry City.“I really enjoyed my time there and I’m back enjoying football again.”Low is looking forward to ing to face Aberdeen with a Scottish Cup quarter-final place on the line.He is hoping Gary Naysmith’s Doonhamers can cause an upset, but he knows it will be tough against his former side.He added: “There is a lot of quality in our squad. Stephen Dobbie is the one everyone talks about.“But there are a few other players who maybe don’t get talked about as much.“Dobbie has scored  goals this season, so everyone knows how good a player he is.“But it’s fair to say Aberdeen have plenty of quality in their side, but hopefully we can make it a tough game for them come Sunday.“In my opinion they are the second best team in Scotland and they have been that for a number of years.“If we play our best and Aberdeen play their best, then it will still be tough for us and we may need some luck.“You never know what might happen and hopefully we can catch them on an off day and you never know.“It will be a tough ask, but it’s a game we look forward to.”"},{"url":null,"title":"blue toon must step up as top two clash","story":"Peterhead captain Rory McAllister says they must prove their League Two title credentials by beating Edinburgh City tomorrow.The second-placed Blue Toon face table-toppers Edinburgh at Balmoor and a win for the Buchan outfit will narrow the gap to one point.McAllister and his team-mates also have two games in hand on City and the skipper knows the importance of picking up three points tomorrow to put them in a strong position.The talismanic striker said: “From now until the end of the season every game is a cup final for us.“If we win all our games we’ll win the league so that’s the way we have to look at it. It’s in our hands to finish top of the league and hopefully we can do that.“If we win this game it puts us in a good position and it means the pressure is more on them than it is on us. If we don’t win tomorrow the pressure will be on us.“If we win the game it means they have to go and win a lot of games because the ball would be in our court to go top of the league.“I think the boys we have are good enough to win the league and we’re honest enough to know that these are the games where you have to step up and prove you’re good enough.“People can say we’re the best team in the league, but this is a situation where we have to go and show that we are the best team.”From two previous meetings with Edinburgh this term, Peterhead have only taken one point – that’s a statistic McAllister wants to improve, but he knows it won’t be easy against City.He added: “We’ve played them twice already we’ve lost and we’ve drawn. I thought we should maybe have beaten them down at Ainslie Park when we drew -.“But even when we played them at home we had a few chances to take something from the game.“It will be a tough game and they keep churning out results so we expect it to be dficult.“We had a wee blip against Annan last Saturday week and lost -, but we just need to keep playing the way we have been before that and hopefully get a result.”McAllister hopes to play a big part in tomorrow’s game after battling to overcome back problems that have plagued him in . The -year-old said: “I think I’m over the worst of it. I’m not completely right, but it’s OK.“I’ve trained since Annan and I trained on Saturday with Cove and on Monday with Cove because, with the weather and everything, it’s been better for the Aberdeen boys to be training more locally.“I do put strain on my back with my job as a plumber because I’m usually bent over a boiler or a sink or something. It’s one of these things and you have to manage it as best you can.”McAllister has scored  goals this season, but he’s not entirely happy with that total.“If I look back, I should have scored a few more,” he said.“But the team is still competing at the top of the league, which is the most important thing. I’m sure the goals will come –  is all right, but not quite as good as normal. As long as the team keep winning I’m not too fussed about it.“I still have a lot to contribute to the team and the goals will come.“I also feel I’m contributing in other ways outside just scoring so it can even itself out, although it’s always good to score.”"},{"url":null,"title":"mid argyll girls secure scottish cup win","story":"Bruce WestUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowHere’s a novelty question. When did two players from Mid Argyll help Rangers win the Scottish Cup The answer is # . Local girls Jasmine McPhie and Carla Todd were both key players in Rangers Girls triumphant run in the Girls Under  Scottish Cup.In their run to the final, Rangers played the top four under  girls teams in Scotland beating Aberdeen - in the first round, then Hamilton - and Central Girls - in rounds two and three. A quarter-final tie against Glasgow City saw the Rangers Girls win - to set up an old firm semi-final against Celtic Girls in which the Rangers Girls emerged - winners in a close game.The final was played on Saturday November  at the Oriam Performance Centre in Edinburgh. In a competitive match, Rangers started strong but Hibernian began to come into the game and whilst both sides had chances, the score remained - at half time. In the second half, Rangers took the lead in  minutes but three minutes later Hibernian drew level.There were few chances in the remainder of the second half and at full time both teams were level at -. Rangers took the lead again in extra time with a deserved winner to secure the cup.Jasmine and Carla came through the Lochgilphead Soccer Centre from primary one age to primary seven, playing in local festivals.In   the girls were important members of the successful Lochgilphead Red Star  team which won the DFDL league cup and finished second in their league. At the end of that season they joined Rangers Girls where they are in their second season playing mostly in the Paisley League against boys teams but also in national girls# competitions.Both girls have also been involved in Scotland national squads for their age group and the Soccer Centre is delighted to see them thriving with a big club.With more than  girls now playing football through the Soccer Centre, the success of Jasmine and Carla should be a real inspiration for local girls.So girls, you may live out in rural Mid Argyll but with talent, hard work and the right attitude you could be creating your own football opportunities."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

However, a good friend of the museum has stepped forward with the offer and agreed to allow Dunadd Community Enterprise time to explore the possibility of buying the building and make a final decision that any community use has the full support of its members and is sustainable.Since the Church of Scotland moved to its new premises in Kilmartin, it has been its intention to sell Kilmartin Church and the Glebe, as well as the churches in Ford, Kilmichael Glassary and Kilmichael of Inverlussa. Kilmartin Museum has been in discussions with the Church of Scotland about buying the Glebe to use for their education programmes, and to develop overflow parking in a small area to accommodate the extra visitors expected when the redeveloped museum opens in .At the recent AGM, members of Dunadd Community Enterprise supported the committee to go ahead with seeking funding to commission a full feasibility study that would explore sustainable community use of the building. Funds would be required to buy, renovate and convert the church.There have been lots of ideas and discussion, but careful business planning is required to ensure whatever the church is used for would attract grant funding and crucially, would be sustainable in the long term. This will take some time and funding needs to be sought for a feasibility study in the first instance, so Dunadd Community Enterprise could not currently buy the church.Kilmartin Museum already has funding in place to purchase the Glebe Field, and they need to go ahead with this to keep to their redevelopment project timescales. However, the benefactor has said it will be possible to maintain public access to the historic stones housed in the church and that the museum can also use the building while the building work required during the redevelopment project is taking place.Dr Sharon Webb, museum director said: ‘It would have been a real shamethe church and the historic stones had become inaccessible, and this decision by the church head office could have presented real dficulties to both the museum and community enterprise, so it’s great that a temporary solution has been found. It’s wonderful that there are such generous and philanthropic people who want to make a dference to both the museum and the local community.’David Bracken, chairman of the Dunadd Community Enterprise, added: ‘This gives us the time we need to explore all the possibilities and make sure thatwe do go ahead and raise funds to buy the church, it’s the right thing for the community now, and for future generations.’Negotiations between the Church of Scotland head office and the anonymous buyer are ongoing."},{"url":null,"title":"a76 roadworks set cause disruption","story":"NewsA roadworks set to cause disruption as Transerv Scotland prepare to close roadRoad chiefs say the work is part of their vital schedule of improvements taking place across the network.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  FEB NewsRoadworks will hit the A this weekend\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailDrivers are set for travel misery this weekend as a large part of the south wests road network is resurfaced.Almost km of the A will be treated south of Glenairlie, between Sanquhar and Carronbridge.The work will involve a weekend closure of the road.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13926204.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18355078.jpg","title":"ayr united 2 inverness 3","story":"NewsAyr United  Inverness : John Roberston hails Somerset Park among best grounds in worldThe Inverness gaffer was full of praise for the old fashioned surroundings as his side clung on in the face of a stirring fightback.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN NewsNathan Austin puts Caley - up \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailJohn Robertson hailed Somerset Park as one of the best grounds in the WORLD after Caley held off a storming Ayr fightback.

Its brilliant...one of the best grounds in the world to come and play your football. In the past we might have lost a game like this so Im delighted.  Ayr knew a win here would take them top of the Championship and started well with Robbie Crawford missing a good chance in the first minute. But they soon hit the self destruct button as their defence went AWOL to allow Nathan Austin in for a double before Liam Polworth rammed home a third. The game looked over with barely  minutes on the clock and shellshocked Ayr took time to regroup. Coventry-bound Michael Rose rocked the post with a header before Michael Moffat drew a fingertip save from Cammy Mackay. McCall turned to the bench at half time and introduced top gun Shankland who immediately turned the tide. He set up Declan McDaid to haul Ayr back into the contest with a close range finish eight minutes after the restart. And a resurgent Ayr thought they had a penalty when Carl Tremarco appeared to handle in the box but ref Nick Walsh waved away loud protests. United continued to pour forward as the clock ticked down and Shankland set up a grandstand finish when slamming home a  yard free kick with five minutes left.  But their comeback proved too little too late as Inverness clung on. Ayr boss McCall said: Im just gutted. Weve conceded three goals and at least two of them were gted with just crazy defending. And were the team with the best defensive record in the league. I think a draw would’ve been fair but it’s just one of those nights.

However, it has a narrow focus in terms of local taxation.ldquoGiven the consultation only concluded last Friday, it is surprising that the Scottish Government were able to announce the tourist tax today.The new deal with the Scottish Greens includes an extra poundm for the core local government settlement, a move to three-year local authority budgets and legislation that will give councils control over tourism taxes.The deal also includes raising the council tax cap, meaning local authorities will now be able to increase council tax by .%, up from %.Fellow Tweeddale East councillor Stuart Bell, also leader of the councilrsquos Scottish national party opposition group , said: ldquoSignicant announcements have been made on a phased development of alternatives to the council tax. ldquoAlthough I donrsquot advocate that locally we should immediately take advantage of the proposal to give local authorities power to introduce a tourist tax, or the suggested workplace parking levy, these are adjustments that some Scottish city authorities will want to take up after the necessary legislation is approved.ldquoI am also pleased that talks on meaningful alternatives to council tax will restart and that with a three-year funding settlement, as opposed to the current one-year deals, there will be more clarity for local authorities on future funding.ldquoThere are also small changes in the - revenue grants for local authorities. Despite the constant chant of despair from the Bordersrsquo Tories, I said all along that the December announcements of funding for the council were only provisional. ldquoThe Conservatives who lead the council like to highlight that we were told we might see pound.m less for core revenue funding next year, conveniently forgetting to talk about promised money for new services such as the massive expansion in early learning and childcare.ldquoThey also omit to tell Borderers that we are getting poundm more next year as capital funding, almost exactly offsetting the change in revenue funding.ldquoWe must wait until the detail of the poundm package from the Scottish Government is analysed by officers, but my provisional calculation is that the new funding announcements could give the council more than pound.m, meaning that we will see a clear cash increase in next yearrsquos funding for core revenue and capital.ldquoSadly, we are being told that the Conservatives in Holyrood may vote against these welcome changes.Rachael Hamilton, Conservative MSP for Ettrick, Roxburgh and Berwickshire, said: ldquoThanks to the SNP, Scots across the country are about to be hit by a triple tax bombshell.ldquoThis budget not only taxes aspiration but taxes people for driving to work, which is quite frankly ridiculous in a constituency like mine, where travelling by car is essential.ldquoWe will pay the highest income taxes in the UK, council tax could go up and now you might even be taxed hundreds of pounds a year for taking your car to work.ldquoThe SNP have run out of ideas on how to grow and expand the economy.

In my current role, there is barely a day that goes by without discussing with a parent or carer the impact of sugar in their childrenrsquos food, but, letrsquos face it, fat, salt and sugar make things taste nice, and itrsquos easy to fall into the trap of overindulgence.ldquoThatrsquos okay every now and again, but regular overindulgence of fat, sugar and salt leads to grave consequences, such as tooth decay, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.ldquoObesity, including childhood obesity, is fast becoming the epidemic of our age.ldquoMany of us are blissfully unaware just how much salt, sugar and fat is in the foods we buy.ldquoBig companies which produce, promote and retail these products are in it to maximise profits.ldquoThey have at their disposal expensive advertising and marketing which hugely influence our choices and purchasing habits.However, Galashiels councillor Harry Scottfelt the proposals amounted to unwelcome government meddling with personal choice, saying: ldquoIrsquom not in agreement with any of the proposals in this paper.,params: .pushldquoI appreciate the problem, but this is typical nanny state, dictating to us how we should live our lives.ldquoIt will cause unnecessary restrictions on business, specialist retailers will find it hard to market themselves, and I doubt very much whether it will have any impact on the groups it is targeting.ldquoWhilst Irsquom very much in favour of labelling food to make clearer to the consumers whatrsquos in it, in principle I am against compulsion.ldquoPeople have to take responsibility for their own lives and lestyle choices, and as long as you keep within the law, the state should have no place in telling you what you can eat or drink.A motion put forward by Councillor Scott called for the response to be completely rejected, but it was not supported by his fellow councillors.Instead, they opted to vote to submit the consultation response in full, albeit as a council officer response not as a political response.According to NHS Health Scotland, in ,  per cent of Scotlandrsquos children were at risk of becoming overweight and  per cent were at risk of becoming obese.That same year,

The doorsquocot is a clue that once a residence of some signicance stood here. It was called Dolphingstone Castle. Nothing now visibly remains of the castle, but around  years ago ruins were still to be seen.It was at one time an elegant mansion, but before that, on the same site, an older castle once stood ndash now all gone, and the structures of modernity are hemming in what is left of this ancient site. A wave of new housing laps at its walls to the west, the A traffic roars past on its south, and roads surround it on other quarters.One wondersthis small slice of East Lothian history will survive the developers. I hope it does. It is a small, historic fingerprint and gives a mysterious glimpse into our countyrsquos past, in an area now being carpeted with thousands of new houses.Earlier maps suggest that Dolphingstone Castle was surrounded by woodland. So perhaps the planting of a small wood or orchard within the old walls could create an island of both nature and history amidst the tide of urbanising development in this area.Up above on the ridge of Falside Hill to the south, the restored Farsquoside Castle looks down on the developments below . It sits like an eagle perched on a high ridge, observing the land below.How dferent the landscape it surveys would have been in  when, according to an old story, a small force of hand-picked warriors descended from the castle under the cover of darkness.It was just past midnight when they left, guided by a slither of moon. It was a raiding party, bent on revenge and heading for Preston Tower in what is now Prestonpans.Tradition tells us a feud had existed between the houses of Farsquoside and Preston for some years. The cause of the feud was the breaking down of walls between the two estates and the animals of each side grazing on the land of the other. Regular, and sometimes violent, clashes had taken place.But then Hamilton of Prestonrsquos livestock had been poisoned, or so it seemed. They had drunk from a burn which flowed from Farsquoside and it was assumed the water had been deliberately poisoned. Hamilton of Preston Tower, making no investigation, sent his men on a raid of violent retribution.Farsquoside Castle was attacked and blood was shed. This was the act which the select band of warriors who had set forth from Farsquoside were to avenge.In darkness, they filed down from the ridge on a path now known as Whinney Loan. This took them down to where the new houses are now being built on the southern edge of Wallyford.From here, great care was needed lest they be seen or heard. Dolphingstone Castle lay ahead and although their grievance was not with the occupants of Dolphingstone, early discovery could ruin the element of surprise.So the raiders veered north of Dolphingstone, by way of Prestoungrange, and at dawn, with the smell of the salt pans in their noses, they set about their vengeful work.Screams and running bairns alerted the occupants of Preston Tower. Armed men were ready, for this raid was expected, although not from this direction.The walls of Preston Tower held the attackers at bay but the people of the village suffered the worst of the slaughter. What senseless violence: neighbours separated only by the brae of a hill had been whipped up into a hateful frenzy against each other. Gradually the raiders melted away, back up the hill, with blooded swords.But hate builds on hate and the reckoning was not slow in coming. The very next day, Hamilton of Preston led a force westwards. It arrived by the walls of Dolphingstone Castle and then rounded past them to head up the hill towards Farsquoside, crossing where now the A speeds by.No attempt at surprise was required, this was to be an open fight. The Lord of Farsquoside had arranged his men along the top of the ridge, looking down on the approaching force of Hamiltonrsquos men. The order to charge was given and the men of Farsquoside poured down the slope.The leaders of both sides were in the thick of the fighting. It was the Lord of Farsquoside who fell, pulled from his horse and hacked to death by Hamiltonrsquos men.Seeing the death of their leader, the men of Farsquoside fled back to the castle. But the Lady of Farsquoside, in shock and rage at the death of her husband, rallied the men. She led them out of the castle in a furious charge as the sun began to set, forcing Hamiltonrsquos men to flee back to Preston.The battle, or skirmish as some would call it, was over, and the feud had reached its bloody climax. Soon after it was discovered an infectious disease had stricken the cattle, not poisoned water. Cattle on both sides had been equally affected. No one was to blame.How easy it had been to make enemies out of neighbours based on  assumptions. We are told Hamilton attempted to make amends. But the dead could not rise and the Lady of Farsquoside was said to be devastated at the loss of her husband. We can be sure others of lesser status suffered no less.This feud was over little remains to record it except tradition passed down, captured and retold by th-century writers such as P MrsquoNeill and Robert Seton, from whose works this account is garnished.Preston Tower still stands in Prestonpans, in a ruined but still defiant state. Farsquoside, much restored, is a visual delight still keeping watch atop the ridge. But only those feint hinds of Dolphingstone Castle remain, most of it lost to time and mystery just like the details of this story.But all the more reason to preserve and value them, I think."},{"url":null,"title":"betting-businesses-told-to-monitor-gambling-habits-of-people-on-benefits","story":"East Lothian Councilrsquos licensing board has approved a new gambling policy which puts the responsibility for policing the risks of betting in the hands of new licensees.Among the issues that new applicants will have to prove they have addressed before being given a licence will be monitoring ldquogaming trends that may reflect benefit payments, ldquoidentying and reporting attempts to launder money on premises and ldquoprotecting vulnerable people and those with gambling dependencies.Approving the new draft policy, which will govern the boardrsquos licensing decisions for the next three years, board members raised concerns about a lack of legislation to stophigh streets in deprived communities becoming lined with betting shops.Councillor Lachlan Bruce, Preston Seton Gosford ward member, called for current laws which prevent local authorities from refusing a licence to betting businesses because of overprovision to be changed.He said that it was impossible to walk down some town centre streets without being confronted by gambling premises offering promotions and deals.Mr Bruce told the meeting: ldquoThere are high streets in East Lothian where [betting shops] seem to be every  yards.ldquoThere is an issue where it is impossible to avoid gambling premises.The board was told that the Gambling Act  precluded using overprovision as a reason to refuse a licence for a betting shop.The councilrsquos new policy will put the onus for local risk assessments on applicants who want to open licensed gambling premises ranging from bookies to casinos, bingo halls, tracks and travelling fairs.Board member Councillor Jane Henderson, North Berwick Coastal, spoke of the dangers of gambling addiction, saying: ldquoGambling is an extremely destructive situation and sometime it does not get the headlines other things do.ldquoBut it crosses all walks of le and we, as a board and as iniduals, have a moral duty to recognise it is as much an illness as anything  and anything we can do to help should be taken very seriously.Councillor Willie Innes, council leader and Preston Seton Gosford ward member, cautioned that only a minority of people who gambled were affected by addiction and for others it was simply an activity they enjoyed.He told board members: ldquoWhen I first joined the council, gambling was a backstreet activity with premises down back alleys and it took us a long time to persuade the industry to come onto the high street.Mr Innes said that the new policy, which set out additional risk assessment requirements for applicants, sent ldquoa clear message to both the industry and those concerned about it."},{"url":null,"title":"prominent-cockenzie-campaigner-larry-tomlins-remembered","story":"Larry Tomlins, who was chairman of Cockenzie West Tenants and Residents Association, was involved in campaigns to reduce speeding and upgrade local park facilities in his community.The grandfather-of-two was an active supporter of the recent fight to implement speeding restrictions outside new housing at The Chimneys, Cockenzie, and helped oversee the trial and subsequent introduction of  miles per hourspeed limits in the Whin Park area of the village.Mr Tomlins, , grew up in Ayrshire and moved to Cockenzie more than  years ago, where he raised his family with we Ann.A consultant engineer, he ran his own successful business and still found the time to be an active member of his local community.He was a founding member of the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association, which helped improve Whin Park for local families.Ward councillor Fiona OrsquoDonnell said: ldquoLarry made a huge contribution to the tenantsrsquo and residentsrsquo association and the wider community.

The th-century equivalent of a Tesco delivery, it slipped under the noses of the English in the dead of night.The perils that face us as a no-deal Brexit looms are historic in quite another way. When Britain opted to leave it was a vote, we were told, for that nebulous but comfortingly empowering idea of ldquotaking back control. Now, as the military has been put on standby to impose curfews, requisition buildings, impose travel bans and crush any sign of unrest or revolt, we could not be further from the conceit of taking things into our own hands. Quite the reverse: almost everything is beyond our control, from the fast-rising cost of imported goods and materials, to the foods available to buy, to the terms and conditions on which our new relationship with Europe will depend.The threat to medicine supplies is alarming enough.

MPs last week backed an amendment calling for it to be \"replaced\" with alternative arrangements.A joint statement issued after talks between Mrs May and Mr Juncker said: \"Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK Parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council.\"Mrs May set out MPs demands for a \"legally binding change to the terms of the backstop\", while Mr Juncker \"underlined that the EU will not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement\".But he \"expressed his openness to add wording to the Political Declaration\" to be \"more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship\".The PM later said: \"I have set out very clearly the position from Parliament that we must have legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement in order to deal with Parliaments concerns over the backstop.\"What I see and hear from leaders is a desire for us to work together to ensure that we can deliver the UK leaving the European Union with a deal.\"My work is to deliver Brexit, to deliver it on time and I am going to be negotiating hard in the coming days to do just that.\"Mrs May was offered a chink of light by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who again ruled out reopening the Withdrawal Agreement, but said she believed \"solutions\" could be found.Speaking during a visit to Slovakia, Mrs Merkel said: \"I think we can find solutions without reopening the Withdrawal Agreement.

There were goals of outstanding quality, red cards, rammies, crunching tackles, the lot. It was interesting to note some observations from football fans south of the border on social media, who reacted asthey had just been given a portal to the past to witness how football was once, and is really supposed to be played.Two committed teams going hell for leather. Donrsquot you just love it.:Former Rangers manager speaks out on time in Ibrox hot seatWith all that being said though, much of the subsequent discussion in the hours and now days following the match centred upon the second-half flashpoint between Scott McKenna and Alfredo Morelos that ended up with both players being sent off.Now, before we get on to Morelos, it is worthwhile noting here that McKenna has rather slinked out of the spotlight simply by deign of who  was involved in this particular incident. The young centre-back has a huge future in the game, but just as Rangers manager Steven Gerrard pointed out after the match that Morelosrsquo antics could cost him a big move, the same charge could be levelled at McKennahersquos not careful. His reaction to Morelos leaving the boot on his nether regions on Wednesday may have been instinctive, but it was excessive and daft all the same.In the first match of this season too, when Morelos was sent off for a petulant kick at McKenna, the Scotland man was hardly an innocent party. Neither was Morelos, mind you, despite the rescinding of his red card that followed.:Rangers goalkeeper to discover fate over Pittodrie incidentAnd here is where the SFA tribunal have painted themselves into a corner in regards to the Morelos red card, and why it is no surprise to see Rangers appealing the decision.To most neutrals, and in accordance with how the rules have been applied in the last two decades, there seems little doubt that referee Bobby Madden got both dismissals spot on.However, given that Rangers have already successfully appealed the red card against their strikerrsquos ordering off earlier this season on the grounds that the force of his kick was not excessive and did not equate to brutality, then it would seem asthey have a good case to have this red card overturned as well.As daft as it was, the precedent has been set.:Strikers disciplinary record baffles former Ibrox bossHowever much you may disagree with the ordering off on the opening day being overturned, and however much you might think that Morelos deserved his sending offon this occasion too, I donrsquot think you could argue that there was much of a dference between the force of his kick at McKenna on Wednesday and the force of his kick at McKenna in August. Irsquom no lawyer, butthere is to be any semblance of consistency applied from the SFA tribunal, then it would seem to naturally follow that the law should be applied similarly here too.Was it an obvious refereeing error Well,it is deemed not excessive using the same parameters as the August judgment, and so cannot constitute a sending offence of Violent Conduct as the previous ruling explicitly stated, then you would have to conclude that yes, it was. What a mess. And one entirely of the tribunalrsquos own making.EvenMorelos does manage to slither off the hook for the second time this season though, he would do well to take heed of the promptings of his manager regardless. He is one of the most exciting attacking talents this country has seen in recent times. He is spiky and aggressive, sure, but as he displayed on Wednesday, he is developing into a fine finisher. And hersquos only . Rangers should enjoy him while they have him, becausehe can curb his petulant streak, then surely he wonrsquot be around for all that much longer."},{"url":null,"title":"andrew-mckie-there-may-be-hope-for-us-yet-if-even-corbyn-can-talk-sense","story":"Not Theresa May, off to Brussels again ndash though not, we were told, to suggest an actual change to her withdrawal agreement that would make it possible to get it through the Commons, but merely to tell the EU that there will have to be some sort of change, because nobody will put up with the backstop as it is. I suspect the Prime Minister of being the sort of woman who might choose I Will Survive when roped into the karaoke, but no one can deny that shersquos done it her way. Even though her way has created most of the problems.But however traumatic and alarming the road to Brexit has been, yoursquove got to give this political drama credit for retaining the ability to surprise. Of all the possible outcomes , the one which never occurred to me was that Jeremy Corbyn would start talking some sort of sense.I donrsquot want to overstate the case, obviously. The letter that the Labour leader sent to the Prime Minister still describes a kind of Brexit which I donrsquot like or want. But I think wersquove all accepted that wersquore none of us going to get what we want, and Mr Corbyn ndash in his own way just as stubborn as Mrs May ndash has at least managed to do what she has not, and drop some of his pet preconceptions of what Brexit has to be.Therersquos the small point that the Labour Partyrsquos previous position, set out in six tests of spectacularly vague aspiration, not to mention downright fantasy, was even more ludicrous than Mrs Mayrsquos vision. Indeed, the only one of those tests which had any detail ndash that we retain absolutely every benefit of EU membership, but leave anyway ndash was not just fantastic but by its own definition literally impossible.The same canrsquot be said of the new version of Labour policy, though, as is also true of the Tories, itrsquos never entirely clear whether this is actually policy or merely what think-tanks like to call ldquoa contribution to the debate. But it is actually a contribution and a reasonable and constructive one, at that.Instead of the six tests, there are five demands, simply described and perfectly cogent: a permanent UK-wide customs union alignment with the single market alignment with EU rights and protections participation in EU agencies and close co-operation on security, including the European Arrest Warrant. The remarkable thing about the letter detailing theseis not just that itrsquos thoroughly serious, but that it is quite reasonable to think of all those demands as achievable. In fact, though it doesnrsquot describe them in terms of the EEA, the five demands are very similar to the Norway + or Common Market . solutions which have been suggested by the likes of Labourrsquos Stephen Kinnock and the Toriesrsquo Nick Boles.There are several advantages, of which the main ones are that itrsquos a kind of off-the-shelf solution which the EU has already given other countries, that it delivers Brexit without throwing trade and business into chaos, and that it probably stands as good a chance as anything of getting through the Commons.I repeat that I donrsquot like it myself. If you were to choose between being in a customs union or the single market, yoursquod go for the latter. A permanent customs union, without EU membership, would put us in the same position as Turkey, unable to strike independent trade deals with third countries, but compelled to accept the terms of deals the EU negotiates with other nations, without any say in formulating them, and with those third countries under no obligation to reciprocate.But as Mr Corbynrsquos letter points out, EU leaders have already said that such changes to the Political Declaration are possible,there are changes to Mrs Mayrsquos red lines .The fact that it would involve the Prime Minister backing down at all is one good reason for thinking that this Labour plan probably wonrsquot happen. Even so, the partyrsquos new position is a signicant development. EvenI donrsquot think itrsquos a sensible plan, itrsquos at least not a nonsensical one.The other thing that makes it signicant is that Mr Corbyn has nailed his colours to the mast. Hersquos claried that Labour remains committedto delivering Brexit, though a fairly soft version of it. That may not be the majority view of Labour members, or even MPs, but at least it lets the electorate know the partyrsquos stance.Last week, I thought that the only realistic option that avoided a no deal Brexit was a rewording of Mrs Mayrsquos withdrawal agreement. If ndash a hugendash some substantial alteration to it can be negotiated, it still seems much the most likely outcome. Thatrsquos mainly, of course, because the Prime Minister is not the kind of person who has regrets, even though they ought to be too many to mention. But the sht in Labourrsquos position revives the outside possibility that something akin to an EEA solution could be got through the Commons.Itrsquos also,there were anyone out there still flogging the Peoplersquos Vote horse, a fairly bald statement that, as far as the Labour leader is concerned, that particular nag has been shot and sent to the knackerrsquos yard. Whether this new stance is in the Labour Partyrsquos best electoral interests, or stands any realistic chance of coming about, matters less than the fact that at last someone has produced a relatively sensible proposal, evenitrsquos one I donrsquot much like.

She describes herself after the referendum result just months before as ldquocrushed and shocked.But when she moved to Edinburgh she found that the city rejected Brexit, and accepted her.ldquoI hardly ever hear any debating, and I canrsquot recall ever meeting anyone who is openly a Brexit supporter in Edinburgh she says.ldquoThrough the last year Irsquove never met any hostility against me as a Swedish person.ldquoIf anything, Irsquove had people saying to me that I shouldnrsquot worry since Irsquom Scandinavian, and the UK apparently likes Scandinavian people.ldquoHow does that make me feel  Completely awful.Alice ThorsellAlicersquos French friend, Florine Le Moine, says the same.ldquoI think it might have to do with the fact that Irsquom a young French woman, she says.ldquoWhenever I told people I was French they thought it was charming and were all very welcoming.ldquoIrsquove never been told Irsquom stealing other peoplersquos jobs.A third member of the group, Clement Samzun, came from France to work in hospitality.He says he has met people ldquowilling to share cultures, communicate and live with each other.ldquoI personally work hard here, pay my taxes and live in this country, and I have never suffered any hostility from UK citizens here, he adds.Clement SamzunOlivia Ottervald, who moved to Scotland as a student from Poland, is quicker to identy the characteristics that she feels protect her from anti-immigrant sentiment in the UK.ldquoNo one was suspicious of me but Irsquom also a white cisgender woman who speaks good English, she says.ldquoI did meet a taxi driver, who obviously voted for Brexit, who said I was alright but that they just donrsquot want more people from Poland to come and take their jobs.ldquoBut that was just once in the Scottish countryside.Olivia OttervaldElina Dagdelini came to Scotland from Greece to study at Glasgow Caledonian University.

So when they said were going ahead with Brexit, I elbowed my husband and said: its happening. He looked at me and said, what are you talking about  I said, it is happening, and were out.

And neither do the UK government or the EU leaders, because none of these questions have been answered,  days before Brexit.

I have built a career here, I am responsible for a college library and I am on the board of the professional body for librarians in Scotland . I am not on a permanent contract and I am not even sure that my employer will be able to renew my contractI have to get a VISA.

To tackle the uncertainty I started the process to Brexit-proof myself almost straight away. I applied for a Registration Certicate, Residence Card, and ultimately British Citizenship.\"To be honest, it feels somewhat bittersweet: to have become a British citizen at a time where EU citizens are increasingly made to feel like others.I now feel more secure, although my job prospects are uncertain . I also worry for EU citizens here whose road to settled status or citizenship is more challenging, as well as for British nationalsand their ability to move to the continentthey ever wanted or needed to.\"One final thing I dont fully understand is the governments outward hostility towards EU citizens, such as Theresa Mays lsquoqueue-jumpingrsquo comment.

I do not mean this solely from a personal perspective as a EU citizen, but also from a societal perspective. It is now clear that Brexit is not going to be the idyllic tale they wanted people to believe.\"As I write, the government is stepping up preparations for a no-deal. This eventuality would, without a doubt, present serious and long lasting negative consequences, which will be detrimental for the whole of society both in the short and long term.\"My greatest concern is related to the NHS and its future.

Moreover, for me research is a collective or group experience that has to go across country borders: being exposed to the iety of ersity of cases and situations we have in Europe is a great form of learning. I could not imagine keeping doing research without being exposed to such ersities and to European research networks and communities.\"Personally, for someone like me that deeply believes in Europe and feels as a European citizen, Brexit has brought in a sense of rejection, likethe community that hosted me at some point decided I was not welcome anymore.

Even before Brexit has taken effect, we are already seeing less collaboration with our European colleagues due to uncertainties about continued funding and the freedom of movement of researchers between the EU and UK.\"Personally, it feels like a kick in the teeth. Brexit was ldquowon on a dislike of others and a disregard for facts, which for a non-British academic like me is impossible to understand or accept.

months, following a fire in the old building back in .Temporary accommodation on site was made for the nursery children.The new library space at Kinellar SchoolThe new school is built on the same site as its predecessor. As part of the build, the project team used the opportunity to improve facilities in the village by redeveloping a derelict tennis court and constructing an enclosed children’s play park as well as additional parking for use by the school and local community.The school’s social staircase is already becoming a well-used architectural feature alongside its many other bright and airy flexible learning spaces, including the glass fronted library and learning area upstairs.Its teaching wings benefit from cleverly designed acoustics, modern set up and technology offerings in all  classrooms, and are on two levels, with lightwells connecting them.Specially commissioned artwork is also an important feature of the new school.Local artists worked with pupils to design and create a number of pieces, including a large Oak tree in the dining area symbolizing growth with leaves painted by every child.  Aberdeenshire Provost Bill Howatson said: “A great team effort has led to the delivery of an extremely high quality building on time and on budget, and we’re thankful to everyone who has played their part in that. data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Erasums students question what will happen after Brexit\"  What is the future for Erasmus students after Brexit  viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"“It stands testament to what a community can achieve by working together, right from those dark early days after the fire when local people rallied round to offer soup and sandwiches to staff, to the lovely reception pupils received from the community in Kintore.”Chair of Education and Children’s Services Committee, Councillor Gillian Owen said: “It’s not only wonderful to see the pupils at Kinellar enjoying their new school but also to reflect on what a fantastic learning experience this project has given them. In addition to the educational opportunities – working with artists, the community and the construction team – the pupils have also learned important lessons when it comes to being resilient and flexible.”Head Teacher Pamela Farquhar added: “As much as we loved our time at Kintore it is nice to be back home.“The new school was made possible thanks to Anne Gibson who sold her land to Aberdeenshire Council.“Her husband was a former head teacher here so the school has a special place in her heart.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inspectors praise north east nursery","story":"Education inspectors have expressed confidence in the ongoing improvements being made at Rothienorman Pre-School Nursery.A recent visit led to the village hall facility being described as a “welcome and nurturing environment” and Inspectors said children were “happy, enthusiastic, and developing confidence”.Key strengths included a “dedicated team” which inspectors said have developed positive relationships and a “strong sense of community”.But the nursery has been asked to improve in certain areas, including increased use of national guidance to develop a “robust and rigorous approach to self-evaluation”. Inspectors said this will enable practitioners to identy what is working well and what needs to improve.They also want to see development of approaches to assessment and planning to help improve the quality of learning experiences and provide “greater depth and challenge” for all children.Improvements are also being sought in the development of practitioners’ knowledge and understanding of how to support children’s early language and mathematical thinking.Inspectors are confident that the setting has the capacity to continue to improve and will make no more visits in connection with this inspection.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..!

He said some areas of the town, such as Shore Street and Upper Ormlie, had been designated as one-way streets some time ago but this had not been implemented. \"That needs to be corrected,\" he said at Tuesday nights meeting.Mr Potts and other community councillors felt something had to be done to address the issue of speeding and one suggestion was for more sleeping policemen to be installed in problem areas of Thurso.Councillor Rosie, who represents Thurso and Northwest Caithness on Highland Council, said what is needed is a transport review which can take a comprehensive look at the issue. \"We need a strategic look at the whole thing ndash something which covers transport management and pedestrians,\" he said.However, community councillor and former police officer Bert MacLeod urged caution. He said: \"You need to be careful you dont go overboard with this  mph limit. Modern cars can stop quicker than vehicles did in the past. We need to be sensible.\"Mr Potts claimed \"some of the driving in Thurso is abysmal\".Mr MacLeod replied: \"Why should you and I be affected because someone drives like an idiot \"He also pointed out there are problems with installing sleeping policemen on roads. New laws have been introduced as cars have been damaged by them, he said.\"It is not just a case of putting them down,\" stated Mr MacLeod. He argued that enforcement is the key to tackling the problem.\"If you had a traffic warden in each town again that would help,\" he added.Community councillor Colin Johnston said something should be done to address the issue of traffic and parking in the town.Struan Mackie, another Thurso and Northwest Caithness Highland councillor, stressed that it takes time to process traffic orders and pointed out that the mph plan for Wick began over two years ago.He also pointed out that the county is going to get traffic enforcement officers which should help deal with some of the parking issues.Mr MacLeod commented: \"You have got to watch you do not overdo these things.\"But Mr Potts said: \"Parking has been an issue for a long time. It is up to us to keep fighting. There is parking available in the town so the problem can be overcome. That should be our war cry all the time.\"Friday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"Flexibility plea on new GP deal","story":"THE problems facing GPs in Caithness have been outlined to Scotlandrsquos health secretary Jeane Freeman by two north MSPs.Rhoda Grant and David Stewart.Labour representatives for the Highlands and Islands, met with Ms Freeman to express their concern about the new GP contract and the impact it could have on rural and remote areas.They were accompanied by Phil Wilson, a professor of primary care and rural health at the University of Aberdeen and a GP in Inverness.Also present was a Dingwall GP Miles Mack.Mrs Grant asked Ms Freeman for the face-to-face meeting at the Scottish Parliament and highlighted issues which GPs across the Highlands and Islands have raised with her and Mr Stewart.The doctors told the minister that five of the  permanent GPs in Caithness are likely to retire in the next five years.Ms Freeman heard that since  almost half of all permanent GP posts in the county have been vacant and partially replaced with short-term locum provision.Three practices have ceased to be independent contractors and have been taken over by NHS Highland.Concerns were also raised about the capacity for undergraduate teaching and the effect on retention and recruitment of GPs in remote areas.Doctors have told the MSPs that the new contract fails to recognise the workload in rural areas where surgeries deal with a far greater range of medical problems, including emergencies that would be dealt with in hospitals in urban areas.Mrs Grant said: ldquoThe main concern is that whatrsquos on the table with the new contract is an urban model and this just doesnrsquot suit remote and rural areas.ldquoGPs are worried it will cause poor continuity of care for patients and that procedures currently performed at surgeries are being centralised ndash for instance for blood tests or vaccinations.ldquoThis will inevitably inconvenience patients and worsen health outcomes by raising barriers to care.ldquoThe contract states that other healthcare professionals will be employed to deal with these extra tasks ndash but with rural GP posts remaining unfilled, and shortages of nurses in many areas, how can we expect to find these extra people in our out-of-the-way places ldquoThere must be flexibility for GPs to retain the old system of care.The new contractrsquos funding formula has been based on the number of appointmentsand does not take account of the issues faced by rural areas such as patient and doctor travel.ldquoGPs in our region cannot wait for another three years to see some movement on this and Irsquom hopeful that the health secretary will find a suitable way forward.At the meeting Ms Freeman said she had ldquogenuinely taken the issues seriously and discussion would continue with colleagues.

We have been calling for more parking enforcement in Wick for a while now.\"High Street and Bridge Street are far too regularly packed with cars parked where they shouldnt be. Its an issue that has been raised time and time again by both drivers and pedestrians. Some people think they are above the rules and for too long theyve got away with it.\"He added: \"Under the current proposals Bridge Street and much of High Street will essentially become double yellows, meaning no parking at any time. This should also help stop the constant issue of people selfishly parking in areas like the Market Square.\"The parking bays there are intended only for those who are disabled badge holders but these rules are often ignored by people who just canrsquot be bothered walking.\"Councillor Sinclair said the order would give council officers the power to enforce parking restrictions once they receive the required training but, initially, existing enforcement staff would carry out the work.\"We should expect a much more regular presence than under the old system,\" he said. \"The discussions Irsquove had with the officer responsible for parking have been extremely encouraging.\"Having an enforcement officer in the town for regular and random visits is a great start butthe situation doesnrsquot improve we will still be pushing to get someone in this post locally to clamp down on rogue drivers.\"He explained that in Inverness several council employees have been trained to undertake parking enforcement duties as well as their day-to-day jobs. \"There is no reason why the same couldnrsquot be done up here. If these orders get the go-ahead, and I am confident they will, then I hope we will begin to see a dference in peoples behaviour.\"The Caithness civic leader, Councillor Willie Mackay, also backed the plan. \"It is a fantastic idea but it is the enforcement that is the key to the success of this,\" he said. \"If we can get enough staff trained up to act as traffic wardens ndash and I am pretty sure we can ndash then their presence will deter bad parking.\"Parking in the centre of Wick has been a contentious problem for some time and has often been raised by the local community council and others. If this is approved, it will make a massive dference to the town centre, although there will always be some motorists who will take a chance and park there.\"However, Councillor Mackay has misgivings about the extent of the restrictions planned for other parts of Wick.Friday  Feb  : AM"},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry set to attend Mey games","story":"THE Mey Highland Games is going to ldquoput Caithness in the global spotlight, according to its organiser Captain Richard Otley, after Prince Harry announced he would attend the event this year.Rumours were re last year that Harry and his we Meghan would attend the special event which included para-athletes for the first time but when the royal retinue appeared at pm there was no sign of the couple.Capt Otley believes that the information released over the weekend to the media about Prince Harryrsquos attendance may have come from Buckingham Palace itself.

The planning application also covers landscaping and future restoration of the site.The application process is being handled by consultants AECOM.The council-owned quarry currently supplies stone and aggregate materials for Council roads and building projects as well as the local construction industry.  It extracts Devonian Flagstone which is highly suited to a range of crushed aggregate products, in particular as roadstone and aggregates, used for producing asphalt for road construction and maintenance, with the quarry being the only active producer of asphalt in Orkney.The activity at the quarry generates an income for the Council which is reinvested to provide and protect some of the vital services we provide in Orkney.The current quarry area is heading towards the end of its use and an expansion would safeguard supply of materials. Current output ranges between , and , tonnes of rock per year andapproved, the ha expansion will release approximately  million tonnes of additional resources, sufficient for another  years of production.Full details are available on the Council website at http:www.orkney.gov.uk Council C long-term-development-of-cursiter-quarry-in-firth.htmPersons wishing to provide comments on the proposed development can do so by writing to AECOM at fraser.blackwood@aecom or by post to Fraser Blackwood, APEX ,  Haymarket Terrace, Edinburgh, EH HD by  February .OIC says that, at this stage, comments made to Aecom are for the purposes of assisting with the scheme design and EIA process and as such are not representations to the Planning Authority.

In the first year of operation, the council predicts  million passengers will use the line.: Edinburgh tram extension decision delayed for three monthsAlthough the details of the final business case are not being revealed to the public until it is considered by the transport and environment committee on February , the council says it can be built within a budget of £m. But councillors will be asked to approve an overall budget of £.m to include a recommended six per cent level of “optimism bias” to take account of an increased risk buffer for any problems encountered. An initial assessment of the extension was predicted to cost a total of £m.The delayed original tram line was opened in  and cost £m for a shortened route - more than double the original budget. The estimated final costs of the inquiry into the crisis is expected to rise above £m.Council leader Cllr Adam McVey said: “Edinburgh has a fantastic public transport network but we need to extend the tram to build on our first-class, fully-integrated transport system.“The final business case before us now is the result of a huge amount of work by the project team to produce a strong business case for taking trams to Newhaven which – crucially – does not ert funding from other council services.”He added: “Having developed the case further and gone through the tender process, we now have much greater certainty of the total project cost – following industry guidance, learning the lessons from the previous project and taking a thorough, diligent and prudent approach to risk management.

Our natural world is already in decline, with global warming being considered as the greatest cause of species extinctions this century. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changehas said that a .#C average temperature rise may put - per cent of species at risk of extinction. If the planet warms by more than #C, most ecosystems will struggle. And it is not just tigers and polar bears that will find it dficult to cope. The recently published Scotland’s Nature on Red Alert report demonstrates that the future is looking bleak for many Scottish species and habitats. Commissioned on behalf of Scottish Environment LINK, a network of more than  environmental charities in Scotland, and WWF Scotland, the report draws together existing evidence of climate change impacts on Scotland’s bioersity. In Scotland, climate change is changing the habitats of many species to such an extent that they can no longer live here. Species such as the Snow bunting is already a conservation concern as its mountaintop habitats are under threat, due to higher temperatures leading to less snow cover. Scotland’s globally signicant machair habitat, only found in northern Scotland and north-west Ireland, is under threat from rising sea levels. Machair holds a iety of plants and insects which attract birds such as the Corncrake and the Corn bunting it is also the last UK stronghold of the Great yellow bumblebee. Climate change is warming our rivers and seas. Forecasts indicate that Scotland may lose its White beaked dolphin population, as it is already at the edge of its range and is being pushed further north with warming seas. Some of our most well-known fish species, such as Atlantic salmon and Arctic charr, prefer colder waters but as water temperatures rise, this will threaten the survival and growth of their eggs. While Scotland is regarded as a stronghold for the Arctic charr, a recent study showed that  out of the  UK populations of Arctic charr studied have declined in abundance since . Warmer waters are also affecting the availability of food for many of our seabirds. For example, Kittiwakes, which have declined by approximately  per cent since , rely on sandeels. Sandeels feed on zooplankton, including the copepod Calanus finmarchicus, which does not do well in warmer waters. So as our waters get warmer, sandeel populations decline, which then affects seabirds such as the Kittiwake. Climate change is also affecting food sources of other species such as the Golden plover and the Capercaillie. Changing climate conditions upset the availability of food on which chicks rely on. Specically, a wet June reduces the Capercaillie chick’s ability to forage for insects, with those chicks that eat less having a reduced chance of survival. For the Golden plover there is now a mismatch between the annual breeding time and the annual emergence of the chicks’ critical food source, craneflies.In Scotland, climate change impacts on bioersity will be further compounded due to our geography. With Scotland located at the \u2028western edge of the European \u2028continent, many species will simply have nowhere to go as the Atlantic Ocean is a natural barrier to their movement. These species losses are potentially devastating, and not just in terms of our environment’s natural and cultural value but also because of the ecosystem services our species and habitats provide. We rely on those services for our own wellbeing and to mitigate the impacts of climate change. If our peatlands dry out, they can no longer store as much carbon for us and our rivers may no longer protect us from floodingrainfall levels rise. To stem the tide of species decline in Scotland, we need to drastically cut greenhouse gas emissions by  and reach net zero emissions by  at the latest. However, emissions will go down fasterwe have a healthy environment that can sequester carbon, while continuing to provide important ecosystem services such as pollination, clean water and air.In other words, ambitious climate targets will only really deliverwe restore the health of our nature and improve its resilience to climate change.Therefore, the Scottish Parliament must ensure that the new Scottish Climate Bill fully reflects the ambition of the Paris Agreement to limit the temperature increase to .°C by introducing ambitious targets ending Scotland’s contribution to climate change, and back these up with action to secure the future of Scotland’s wildle.

It’s not optional for some and compulsory for others.As predominantly a cyclist rather than a driver, I tend towards that point of view - but for a dferent reason.: Edinburgh urged to adopt Danish segregated bike lines to boost cyclingJust because some drivers break laws does not mean it’s ok for cyclists to do so too, believing that for them there are unlikely to be any consequences.The roads are an unequal place, errant drivers are far more likely to kill or injure cyclists than vice versa, and the focus should be on educating them to give cyclists more respect.In my opinion - and some riders will vehemently disagree - the way to do that is for cyclists to be beyond reproach themselves. The inconvenient truth is that cyclists need drivers to change their ways more than vice versa.That means riders not sailing through red lights as queuing drivers fume at their arrogance. Not forcing pedestrians to duck out of the way on pavements that are not designated for shared use. Not blithely cycling at night without lights .Of course, there should be equally zero tolerance of drivers doing the same - this is absolutely not one side must behaviour better than the other.Perhaps I’m naive, but my impression is that drivers who see that cyclists are respecting the rules of the road are more likely in turn to respect riders - not stopping in cyclists’ advanced stop lines at junctions, not driving in cycle lanes and giving them more space when passing.: Mark Beaumont calls for drivers and cyclists to respect each otherWhat’s brought this to mind is the rise of the delivery driver and rider, particularly those conveying hot food, such as Uber Eats and Just Eat.I fear that more of these type of drivers and cyclists on the roads, where speed is the essence, will make things worse.I saw one rider cycle onto the pavement to dodge a red light, and you know what  He had no lights on his bike either. “My battery has run out,” he said. On both front and back lights That’s not how cyclists who ride for a living should operate.In an even more unbelievable case, a rider with no lights pulled onto an off-road cycle path in Glasgow city centre at night right in front of my bike so we almost collided. “I don’t need any because I’m not on the road,” came the extraordinary reply.Come on folks - respect each other, whether you’re a driver or cyclist, on a road or a cycle path.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4869831.1549559892!/image/image.jpg","title":"labour and tories may have to split to avoid no deal brexit paris gourtsoyannis","story":"The Conservatives and Labour parties are both too ided over Brexit for any one party to be able to come up with an acceptable deal with the EU, writes Paris Gourtsoyannis.It’s just one of the many ways Brexit has proven to be a disappointment: despite rattling the UK’s constitution to its core and radically altering political norms, leaving the EU has yet to change the landscape of the party system. It was assumed that resolving the internal contradictions over Europe would result a split in one of the two main parties. How could the Tories stay united with one flank abhorring a no-deal Brexit, and the other actively pushing for one  And how could MPs in Labour pushing for a second EU referendum reconcile with a leader who believes in delivering it, not stopping it Trying to push a binary, popular choice through the one of the oldest representative parliamentary democracies in the world has been the root cause of the current deadlock, and the best argument for a no-deal exit from the EU.Now it seems there is a final opportunity to salvage a Brexit deal and avoid a chaotic clf-edge scenario. But having already rampaged through the constitution, devolution and decency in public debate, the price of an orderly Brexit will be high: it needs not one, but both the UK’s main political parties to destroy themselves.It should already have been obvious that no one Brexit position could win unanimous support from either the Conservatives or Labour. Tory MPs were ready to hand their Prime Minister the worst defeat in parliamentary history and torch their remaining reputation as a party of sound government in the process. But Labour MPs, too, have shown how impossible it is to unite behind a single position, even with their leader furiously triangulating between dferent interests. It was Labour votes that killed off not just the idea of a second EU referendum, but also the best chance of avoiding a no-deal exit on  March by extending Article , through the Cooper amendment. Now those same Labour MPs in Leave-voting areas are in talks to accept one-time investment from a Conservative Government in exchange for voting to deliver Brexit, against what their colleagues say is the party and the national interest.: What Donald Tusk could learn from Winston Churchill – Alastair StewartIt’s said the -year-old trauma of the Corn Laws lives on among Tories, who have a terror of party splits – that’s why we had an EU referendum in the first place. An illustration of just how deep that fear runs, and how desperate the situation is, is offered by the so-called ‘Malthouse compromise’ between Brexiteer and Remainer MPs.It has brought together polar opposites in the Conservative Party, with the most extreme Eurosceptic views, represented by Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker, joined in an unlikely partnership by Nicky Morgan, a one-time ringleader of pro-EU troublemakers. Tories enthusiastically embraced the outbreak of compromise and unity – that’s why Housing Minister Kit Malthouse could lend his name to an effort to rewrite the Government’s central policy without being sacked. It’s likely only thanks to the existence of the Malthouse group that the Government was able to salvage its deal, securing a majority for Sir Graham Brady’s amendment calling for the replacement of the backstop.But the Malthouse compromise is an exercise in saying anything to get Tories in the same room together. It’s approach is to take each faction’s core beliefs, cut them in half and stitch them to one another – not one Frankenstein’s monster, but two: a negotiated deal that replaces the backstop with ‘alternative arrangements’ for the Irish border, and a no-deal scenario with a two-and-a-half year transition.It speaks to just how poorly informed the UK political establishment has been throughout the Brexit process that MPs believe a third country could be allowed to automatically stay in the EU single market and customs union. With  days until Brexit, it is beyond credibility, and only makes sense as a Tory team-building retreat.: Brexit: Ireland warning over ‘threats’ as EU rejects May’s dealIn Brussels and in Downing Street, they know Malthouse is a smokescreen, and Brexiteers are no more likely to vote for a final Brexit deal that doesn’t meet their demands. The Tory civil war over Europe is forever: it won’t be solved by a single vote and a couple of PowerPoint slides from a handful of MPs.On the Labour side, Jeremy Corbyn is also learning how dficult it is to bridge ides over Europe. He has manoeuvred himself – and been manoeuvred by shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer – into offering what is probably the only Brexit deal that can win a majority in the Commons and the approval of Brussels, while solving the Irish border problem. It covers a deal that includes a customs union and close alignment with the single market, while remaining silent on the issue of free movement of people.If the Prime Minister and the Labour leader worked together and brought loyal MPs with them, they could get it through parliament. But May would face a huge rebellion – possibly even bigger than the one that saw her lose by  votes a few weeks ago. It would also be costly for Corbyn. EvenLabour MPs weren’t whipped, many would see the offer from their leader as a green light to vote with the Government but for staunch Remainers, their leader’s offer is already a betrayal. As polling has repeatedly shown,voters believe Labour has enabled Brexit, the next election would could be devastating – especially in Scotland.Part of the reason why European politicians have been so appalled by the UK’s approach to Brexit is that on the continent, they are used to cross-party cooperation, particularly on issues of huge national importance. British politics don’t work that way, and haven’t fragmented to the same degree under pressure from the recession and constitutional conflict. But to get a Brexit deal through, that will have to change. To avoid a national calamity, both main parties may have to break themselves.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4869283.1549558359!/image/image.jpg","title":"why nicola sturgeon was wrong to push independence in america pamela nash","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon should travel overseas to promote Scotland # but not the cause of independence, writes Pamela Nash.Scotland ‘The Brand’ is a global success story. Our world-renowned food and drink, and our manufacturing excellence, are hugely successful exports that help grow our economy.The Scottish Government is right to promote Scotland around the world, and that means that ministers must also – from time to time – travel abroad to do so. Similar trade delegations travel from the other nations and regions of the UK to promote their own local companies.Yes, it costs public money for flights and accommodation, but everyone can recognise that the resulting trade deals can, in turn, massively boost our public finances.Today, at First Minister’s Questions, SNP Deputy First Minister John Swinney stood in for Nicola Sturgeon because she is on a trip to North America.The USA is Scotland’s top export destination country with an estimated £. billion of exports from Scotland in , so this is clearly an important market for Scottish companies.Ms Sturgeon’s itinerary includes “trade and culture engagements in Washington DC, New York, New Jersey, Ottawa and Toronto” during the five-day visit.So far, so good.: Nicola Sturgeon plays down prospect of early Scottish independence voteBut the First Minister – on a trip entirely funded from the public purse to represent the whole of Scotland – also delivered a speech at Georgetown University.It was this event which attracted the most media attention, and the SNP carried her full speech on its party website.In that speech, Ms Sturgeon repeatedly highlighted her support for independence.She also talked about breaking up the UK on PBS’s flagship NewsHour current affairs TV programme.It’s clear that the First Minister used this trip not only to promote Scotland, but to promote her party’s own narrow-minded and isive pursuit of independence. That’s a vision which is not supported by the majority of the people she is supposed to represent.It’s also clear that it would create new trade barriers that threaten economic growth.Ms Sturgeon has blurred the lines between the interests of Scotland and the interests of her party – a bad habit of the SNP.It’s time for the First Minister to do her job and represent all the people of Scotland and to focus on growing our economy.The best shot in the arm for our financial future would be for the threat of an unnecessary and unwanted second independence referendum to be taken off the table.Pamela Nash is chief executive of Scotland in Union©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4869861.1549625229!/image/image.jpg","title":"readers poll do you support a workplace parking levy in scotland","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Workers in Scotland hit by a proposed new workplace parking levy could face the equivalent of a p income tax hike, MSPs have heard.Scottish Conservative deputy leader Jackson Carlaw claimed that people have been left “alarmed” by the proposal, which was at the heart of the Scottish Government’s budget deal with the Greens last week.

MPs last week backed an amendment calling for it to be “replaced” with alternative arrangements.A joint statement issued after talks between Mrs May and Mr Juncker said: “Despite the challenges, the two leaders agreed that their teams should hold talks as to whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK Parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council.”Mrs May set out MPs’ demands for a “legally binding change to the terms of the backstop”, while Mr Juncker “underlined that the EU will not reopen the Withdrawal Agreement”.But he “expressed his openness to add wording to the Political Declaration” to be “more ambitious in terms of content and speed when it comes to the future relationship”.The PM later said: “I have set out very clearly the position from Parliament that we must have legally binding changes to the Withdrawal Agreement in order to deal with Parliament’s concerns over the backstop.“What I see and hear from leaders is a desire for us to work together to ensure that we can deliver the UK leaving the European Union with a deal.“My work is to deliver Brexit, to deliver it on time and I am going to be negotiating hard in the coming days to do just that.”Mrs May was offered a chink of light by German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who again ruled out reopening the Withdrawal Agreement, but said she believed “solutions” could be found.Speaking during a visit to Slovakia, Mrs Merkel said: “I think we can find solutions without reopening the Withdrawal Agreement. That is not on the agenda for us.”In diplomatic statements, the description “robust” often indicates a heated row.European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schinas said that the word was “something that both sides agreed was an accurate way to describe the tonality of the meeting”.As Mrs May arrived in Brussels a protester waving a placard reading “Don’t crash out” leaped in front of the PM’s convoy as it arrived at the Commission’s Berlaymont HQ but was quickly whisked away.The possibility of a “disruptive” Brexit is causing economic uncertainty in the EU, commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis said, as Brussels revealed its latest economic forecast.The EU economy is expected to grow .% in , with the UK’s forecast at .% - although this is a “purely technical assumption” based on a status quo relationship with Brussels.Mr Dombrovskis said: “The possibility of a disruptive Brexit creates additional uncertainty.”Meanwhile, the Dailyreported that Mrs May is seeking to delay another Commons “meaningful vote” on the Government’s Brexit stance until the end of February - just a month before the UK is scheduled to quit the EU on March .©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"first look at the jarls squad","story":"Plenty of onlookers were already on the streets as the squad made its first procession of the day from Islesburgh Community Centre, past the galley shed on St Sunniva Street and on to the Toll Clock Shopping Centre.In the gloom, the ranks of the Jarl#s Squad looked the part wearing emerald green kirtles with dragon mots underneath simple brown leather breastplates embossed with the same mot.

We would like to thank everybody for the great support locally.”The house was originally built in  for Eilidh#s great grandfather Samuel Campbell, and for many years it operated as a temperance hotel.Fire ravaged the building in the s and, although part of the domestic side was occupied up until around  years ago, it has since lain dormant.Councillors on the review body said the couple deserved sympathy and support in their vision to restore a building which had been in Mrs Mcniven#s family for four generations.The couple#s supporting statement before planners said: “It is important to remember that this is a property that has been in the same family for  years and is about to become a new home for a young local family. The historic value of the property is not lost on them. However without intervention it may very well be lost entirely.”Dingwall councillor Margaret Paterson said she thought it “sad” that obstacles had been placed in the way of a couple who proposed to put so much into a building that was “almost falling down”.Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and Raymond Bremner, who represents Wick and East Caithness, also spoke in support of the couple#s plans.Councillor Bremner said he believed the aluminium window frames, as proposed for the development, had changed considerably from previous types which did not stand up well to spray from seawater.He added: “I have a lot of sympathy with the applicants and with the points made in their appeal. I don#t have an issue with the change of use.”Broadford and Strath Community Council had lobbied in support of the couple, while neighbours and local businesses also backed the proposed conversion.Community council chairman Hamish Fraser said: “They are proposing to restore a building that will become an asset to the community. It#s a common-sense decision to support a young couple who want to live and make a business here.”Planning officials had turned down the original application on the grounds that it had breached three policies of the Highland-wide local development plan.In their reason for refusal planners said modern windows and a door with patterns “is not in keeping with the character of a historic building”.In his letter of support of the couple, local historian and broadcaster Professor Norman Macdonald said: “In many years of regularly attending Highland Council planning committee meetings at all levels I do not recall a single application where a big and ambitious idea has come to the brink of jeopardy over such relatively immaterial and tangential matters.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/15_9_21-Barcelona-by-Xavier-Mercade-5-Copy.jpg","title":"the waterboys set to kick off skye live festival","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineLegendary Scottish-Irish folk-rock band The Waterboys are to kick-off the Skye Live festival’s fth-anniversary celebrations this autumn.The opening concert in Portree on Thursday th September will see the bandto Skye for the first time in nearly  years.

Across our network, we connect businesses locally, nationally and internationally, with other businesses, with decision-makers and with opportunities. As a respected, recognised voice for business, our opinions are regularly sought by policymakers and politicians and through our networks we have helped businesses of every size, in every sector, to thrive.“The Causeway Coast and Glens area finds itself in exciting times, with plenty of opportunity ahead, from the organic growth of tourism, to the arrival of the Golf in . We also have Northern Ireland’s first Enterprise Zone located within our region and we need to continue to promote and connect the right people to make the most of this opportunity. “To prosper we need to focus on Skills, Infrastructure and Growth. Skills shortage is consistently raised as one of the biggest issues facing our members. There are job vacancies across our towns and villages, and employers cannot fill these because of the shortage of the appropriate skills in the local economy. In many other sectors, we need to promote enterprise and apprenticeship models for schools, colleges, and universities so that students and leavers can build up their knowledge of business, better preparing them for work or to set up their own business, and we need our businesses to be ready to take on and train new people.”Murray adds: “Our Causeway Coast and Glens area, according to recent figures, is the second highest council area in terms of renewable energy production, and we need to build on this towards energy parity and then beyond to energy export. However, we suffer from poor transport and energy infrastructure and we are raising this regularly and know that our local representatives are doing the same. “We need better transport links across the Borough and we need high-quality road and faster rail infrastructure that connects Coleraine to Belfast and Derry-Londonderry, allowing people and goods to travel here and move around.”Explaining the growing importance of technology-based businesses Chamber member, Gary McClarty, Chief Executive of Coleraine based MCL InsureTech says:“Over the last ten years MCL InsureTech has become one of Ireland’s leading online insurance companies. We are passionate about everything online and we are constantly embracing new ways of working to give customers the best possible online experience. We have the technological know-how and expertise to create innovative online loyalty services that will enhance the lives of customers who choose us as their online car insurance partner. “We also market test our IT solutions in a real-time environment, enabling us to continuously improve the end result for both the consumer and business user. Our unique online insurance proposition has already enabled us to capture around € million of the motor insurance market in the Republic which equates to nearly one in every twenty vehicles. We intend to replicate this success in the Northern Ireland market and it is crucial that we can recruit skilled iniduals to help us achieve our objectives.” As part of a major expansion plan in Northern Ireland MCL InsureTech is to create  new jobs in the next  months, with a further  new jobs envisaged over the next three to five years. MCL InsureTech operates three dferent insurance brands ItsWomen.ie, BoxyMo.ie and plus.ie, as well as an IT solutions company DotSys Ltd and a media buying business B Connected Media.Staff numbers at the organisation have more than tripled over the last decade, up from  to .Hospitality and tourism is also another growth sector and ‘A Causeway Welcome’ is a new initiative being developed by Causeway Chamber to support members. One of the forthcoming developments planning to create a signicant number of jobs is the £ Million Merrow Hotel and Spa, providing  rooms, a luxury spa with sea views, a leisure club with a m pool, a glass sauna and infinity pool, a steam room, a gym and studio, a demonstration restaurant, a bar bistro restaurant, a signature cocktail bar, a conference space, meeting rooms and nine chalets serviced by the hotel.

A number of local experts collaborated on the design to ensure the end result was a hotel that was sympathetic to its surroundings. With the number of tourists to the North Coast on the increase, we wish to provide accommodation and leisure facilities to meet demand. It is hoped that groundworks will start in , creating up to  jobs locally.“With two world class golf courses on its doorstep, the Merrow has the potential to become an ideal location for golfing enthusiasts. Portstewart has an excellent links course and is frequently described as one of Northern Ireland’s hidden gems, while Royal Portrush, which will host the  Open Championship, is only a few miles away”.Mark Donnelly from Merrow Hotel and Spa explains the signicance of using a local architect to design the proposed development: “The concept for the design of the hotel was to propose a low-lying building, predominantly three storey, set within its landscape that reached out to the coast and the NW circuit, wrapped around sun-filled courtyard spaces and that could become a focal or signature building for the area. The sea views of Inishowen, North Donegal, and the Scottish islands of Islay and Jura are also an important influence in the design. The objective was to create a building that is of its time and its place, without being ostentatious.” To find out more the Chamber’s priorities and forthcoming plans, spaces are still available for the President’s Business Lunch.

An entrepreneur and pioneer in his field, Sir William, despite his worldwide success, has never forgotten his strong ties to Ballymena.“His vision and dedication has put our borough firmly on the map as an area of manufacturing excellence and innovation.”Mid and East Antrim Borough Council agreed to bestow the Honorary Freedom of the Borough of Mid and East Antrim on the Wrightbus founder in February . It followed a motion proposed by the previous Mayor, Councillor Paul Reid, and seconded by Councillor Audrey Wales MBE.Among those who paid special tributes to Sir William was former Mayor of Ballymena, P.J. McAvoy, who, as a long standing SDLP representative was poles apart on constitutional issues from the ardent unionist. On Friday, however, he told the audience of the personal bond that had grown between the pair during their service on Council.“I well remember Sir William giving me a lt in that great big car of his many times when going or coming from council meetings! “I’m happy to be here today to pay tribute to the man I call my friend,” he said. Further tributes came from North Antrim MP, Ian Paisley who remarked on Sir William’s political activism at a time when many in the business community ‘kept their heads below the parapet’. And he recalled nights in the harsh days of the troubles when his late father would receive ‘phone calls from the man he codenamed ‘Ahoghill’. Mr. Paisley said Sir William was a rare breed in today’s society: “He is a character. If anyone wants to see what makes a real Ballymena man they need only look at Sir William Wright.” Lauren Christie, speaking on behalf of the extended Wright family, thanked all who attended for the honour conferred on her grandfather and paid special tribute to Mrs. Ruby Wright, who, she described as ‘the great woman behind the great man’.

I was born in , my family have been resident in Ballymena for generations, Allen, obviously, on my fathers side and Gribben on my mothers. My parents moved into the Demesne Estate shortly after it was built, first living in Carnduff Drive and then after a few years moving to Glenshesk Drive where they lived the rest of their lives.  I attended Ballymena Boys Secondary School. Music lessons were pretty much a non event. Every exam time each student would be hauled up to the front of class to sing a song and was awarded a C grade. My standout memory of music lessons was hearing the music teacher playing an album of Holsts Planet Suite to himself, this at least started a le long love of classical music.  In my early teens Glam rock was the big thing but apart from Bowie, T Rex, Rod Stewart etc I seldom listened to the charts.  I was more into album bands like Cream, Taste, Hendrix, early Fleetwood Mac, Pink Floyd and especially Led Zeppelin. Of course I followed the usual links from these back through Willie Dixon, Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf to the Delta greats, Robert Johnson, Son House and Charley Patton.  First real early Blues album I heard was by Leadbelly and then Robert Johnson : The King of the Delta Blues , album which has been a major influence on my playing ever since.  I started playing bass guitar when I was about twelve then switched to six string. FLAMINGOMy first paying gig was at The Flamingo playing bass with local rockers Angel when I was fourteen.  After discovering the joys of Blues and Booze, I could be found many a night after closing time, sitting around a fire in the woods at the back of my old school, playing guitar and singing the Blues with friends.  Many Friday nights were passed in The Bridge, Dunloy listening to South Bound Train and most Saturdays were spent in The Pound or The Harp Bar in Belfast, catching as much live music as I could.  This was during the dark days of the Troubles, with bomb warnings and check points an everyday normality but somehow music lovers seemed to live in a world apart, music clubs being one of the few places religion didnt encroach on.  I have played in ious bands throughout the years, including Angel, AGS, Harpers Hill Blues Band, The Flood and BIDDY EARLY as well as playing as a solo Delta Blues player, playing slide guitar harmonica.  Lately I have seriously got into electric Blues Harp, being influenced by Sonny Boy Williamson ii, Little Walter, Paul Butterfield, John Myall, Walter Horton etc. I currently play Blues Harp with The Matchstick Men, Irelands premier Status Quo tribute act, and I also regularly sit in with Legal Tender and Blues Taxis. I can be found most first Saturdays of the month at the excellent BT Blues and Rock Club sitting in on Harp with the featured bands. For the last six years I have been host of BIDDY EARLYS Open Mic at the BT Club, one of the Provinces most successful Open Mics which I also founded. I have finally decided to call an end to it at the start of this year to concentrate on my own music.  I play ious instruments guitar,  string guitar, slide guitar, bass guitar, banjo, mandolin, auto harp, Appalachian mountain dulcimer and of course Blues Harp.  Yeah, after all these years, Ive still got the Blues, once your hooked, thats it for le! - see BB King, John Lee Hooker, Buddy Guy etc.  As for other local promoters of the Blues, theres the afore mentioned BT Blues Club which Looi Burns has been doing an excellent job of running for many years and of course local bands like Legal Tender and Blues Taxis.

And back in the hungry s when every day was a grind to put the most basic grub on the table and keep a roof over your head, it was women like the lady opposite who you relied on to get you to your work on time.Our pictures show one of the last of the ‘knocker-uppers’ who rose well before the crack of dawn every day in le to go round the doors to give people their morning alarm call.Known as ‘The Lady With The Map’, Mary Millar plied her trade in Kells and Connor.A knocker-up was a job in Britain and Ireland that started during and lasted well into the Industrial Revolution, when alarm clocks were neither cheap nor reliable.Most had given up the role by the begnning of the s but Mary was still performing her morning task up until the outbreak of World War .  The knocker-up used a baton or short, heavy stick to knock on the clients doors or a long and light stick, often made of bamboo, to reach windows on higher floors. At least one of them used a pea-shooter!In , the knocker-up would be paid a few pence a week. The knocker-up would not leave a clients window until they were sure that the client had been awoken.A knocker upper would also use a snuffer outer as a tool to rouse the sleeping. This implement was used to put out gas lamps which were lit at dusk and then needed to be extinguished at dawn.There were large numbers of people carrying out the job, especially in larger industrial towns. Generally the job was done by elderly men and women but sometimes police constables supplemented their pay by performing the task during early morning patrols.The pictures, re-discovered by areporter on a research task at the Local Studies Department of Ballymena Library appeared in the Belfast Newsletter in January of .

At only four-days-old Dáithí travelled to London where he underwent open heart surgery. Six days after that he underwent his second open heart operation.Máirtín described the stay as a “hard week” for his family and told the Andersonstown News that although Dáithí’s hearthasn’t declined, there had been slight damage done to his kidneys due to the high dosage of medicine the Ballymurphy toddler has to take.“It was a hard week for Dáithí, it was a hard week for us as well,” explained Máirtín. “There were constant needles, test after test for Dáithí but we got through it. The staff were amazing and the cardiologist seemed happy with Dáithí’s heartbut noticed some kidney damage.“Dáithí takes medicine for his heart, to help him go to the toilet he takes aspirin, around  doses of medicine in total a week. The hospital will be keeping an eye on it. Dáithi’s heartis okay at the minute and he is stable.“I know I speak for Seph and I when I say it was tough for us. When we first went over last year we have been educating ourselves ever since around organ donation and it’s got a lot more real. We were speaking to the surgeon who is going to be taking Dáithi’s heart out and eventually putting in a new one hopefully, it’s a lot more real,” he saidSince the family’s ‘Is Deontóír Mé Yes I Donate’ campaign began back in July, launched by Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey, there has been an increase of four per cent in the number ofpeople in the north who have opted into the organ donation register.Máirtín stressed how transplant is not a cure, but a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.“Seph and I came back from Newcastle saying we had to up the campaign, we have to keep raising awareness. When we were over we had to sign consent forms for the heart surgery for when Dáithí receives his gt, for the surgery to go ahead. You are basically siging a consent form with a list of risks and the first thing that it states is ‘death’ in capital letters and that’s jumping out of the page.“I did a radio interview this week and we were asked ‘so you are basically waiting for someone to die’ so that Dáithí can receive his gt – I said my son is dying, that’s the reality of it. We are desperate to help save his le and truly believe that awareness is key.”“Dáithí had his tube out for three months there and people thought he was fixed because he looks so well, people don’t always think he is sick.”An avid Paw Patrol and Liverpool FC fan, Máirtín and Seph spoke of how their son will continue to wait on the routine list. “He is stable enough to be at home,” explained Seph. “We asked the medical team over in Newcastle what are his chances of getting a heart on the routine list and there was little to none. It’s not impossible but it doesn’t happen that often. There are quite a few children around Dáithí’s weight and age that are unfortunately on the urgent list. We want to be at this stage because it means we are getting more time.”“You don’t want him to get worse but he is going to get worse,” added Máirtín. “While organ donation as a whole is up, hearts for children are down the last two years and that list is going up. As I said transplant is not a cure, transplant give you time. Everybody is dferent the first transplant baby in the UK is now in her ’s. The anxiety that Seph and I have will probably never go away. The last two years have been some of the best and worst times of our lives. We love Dáithí so much and will do anything to get as much time with him as possible.“We have put down hurdles, the first was getting to Newcastle, the second was getting Dáithí assessed, the third was getting him accepted onto the organ list and the next one is getting him a new heart. There will be lots after that but we’ve been taken it one wee step at a time. We would rather be on that rocky road than no road at all,” he said.A family health morning will take place on Saturday February  from -pm as part of Heart Awarnesss month at Glór na Móna.To register to become an organ donor visit: www.organdonation.nhs.uk register-to-donate register-your-details "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"catherine mcevoy to be named musician of the year","story":"FOR anyone who is familiar with Catherine McEvoy’s music it will come as no surprise to learn that she is to receive the Musician of the Year accolade at the upcoming TG Gradam Ceoil  in Belfast’s Waterfront Hall. As one of the leading concert flautists in Irish traditional music, recording success, TV and radio appearances and a considerable teaching contribution has marked her distinguished career. While Catherine is no stranger to critical acclaim, she says that she was “completely shocked” by the announcement of the award, which comes at a time in her le when she least expected it.Over the last  years Catherine has balanced her own music career alongside a teaching career at St Joseph’s School for Children with Visual Impairment and ChildVision in Dublin. By providing lessons and music therapies to students with multiple disabilities and visual impairment, she gives children a  for their talents and helps equip them with skills to improve their quality of le. The positive impact of Catherine’s work is undeniable but, admittedly, it allows her little time for her own music. Despite being a professional Catherine says she deals with her hectic schedule by treating her own music as a hobby.“I wouldn’t have loads of time for my own music, but I was never a full-time musician,” she explains.“Music was always a hobby for me. I would do some teaching at home, and I would do the Willie Clancy Summer School, and I would do some stuff in the States too. The funny thing about the trips away is that they’re almost like a holiday. “When you’re a professional musician you are under a certain amount of pressure all the time, but I’m lucky in the sense that I’m not because I still play my music in the way I want to play it – it’s something that I’ve always done and I love doing it. It’s still a hobby for me even though it takes up most of my le. I’d love to do a lot more playing for myself than I am, but sometimes work can get in the way.”In her family le, Catherine is also surrounded by music. Her husband Tom also plays the flute, while her three grown-up children, Jane, Ruairi and Fergus are accomplished musicians in their own right, but surprisingly, having grown up in Birmingham, Catherine says she herself hadn’t heard Irish traditional music until she was -years-old. However, it was in those musically formative years in the city that followed that she picked up the distinctive traditional music style of her parents’ native Roscommon, which she would become renowned for in the years to come.“My dad was more into football and my mum was a good ballad singer, she would’ve sang at parties and that,” she says.“I remember listening to Elvis and Clf Richards – we had those sort of records in the house when we were very very young, but not particularly traditional music. “It was only later when I was around eleven that I heard traditional music. I thought ‘oh, I like it’. Then my brother was away in boarding school learning classical fiddle and then he got into The Dubliners and started buying their records. That’s when the whole thing took off. “There was a prolic music scene in Birmingham, as there was in London, but it doesn’t get such a high profile. A lot of the big musicians gravitated towards London, but there was still a lot of great musicians in Birmingham, many of them from Roscommon, and there was lot of great musicians passing through. “Funnily enough I heard an interview with Finbar Furey recently where he was talking about playing in folk club in Birmingham run by a man called Mick Hipkiss – the Skillet Pop Club, and we actually used to play there. I remember seeing Finbar play there, and Christy Moore. I also remember the night when Mick Hipkiss announced this new group that had just been formed and were getting on the road called Planxty – that was back in the early s.”She continued: “A lot of County Roscommon players would travel to Birmingham. One of the first lady flute players I saw play was a woman called Peggy McGrath from County Roscommon and I was really taken with her style – that really spurred me on as well.“The Roscommon style, or the Sligo-Roscommon style, is a rhythmical, flowing sort of style as opposed to what they would call the Northern style,” she explains.“It’s slightly smoother and quite up-tempo. It’s something that I inherited. I wasn’t that I consciously decided to play in that style, it’s just because that was the flute playing that I heard. I’m self-taught and what you hear is what you learn.”Although Catherine says she inherited the Sligo-Roscommon style, she has made it her own indelible skill and fluency. Her recognition as the TG Gradam Ceoil  Musician of the Year undoubtedly encompasses a le-time of achievement, but having picked up a serious injury in her hand just over two years ago, she says it comes following a particularly low part of her career. While her musical ability has suffered as result of her injury, in some ways, the award could not have come at a better time.“Two years ago I had aspontaneous rupture in my right hand in part of my tendon, so I’m very lucky that I can still play,” Catherine says.“It took a lot to get over that I initially thought I wouldn’t be able to play again. I’ve actually had to change my hold on the flute slightly. Obviously the older you get the harder it is to recover, but it has taken a lot of mental anguish to get back to level of playing that I would be happy with. I’m probably only back to about  per cent – I’ll never be  per cent, which is sad in away because I had this idea of retiring and going off into the sunset playing for the rest of my le. I had just gotten over it, and then they go and give me a Gradam Ceoil.”She continued: “It was the biggest shock I ever got in my le. It was massive boost, especially coming from a very low part of my le two or three years ago and sort of clawing my way back. “There are probably loads of other people out there who deserve it, but it’s a great thing and I’m really honoured. I’m delighted and to get an award for something that you’ve been doing for most of your le, something that you get pleasure out of doing, is a great bonus.”She adds: “It’ll be wonderful. It does come with a certain amount of pressure because it’s live TV. I’m the type of person who doesn’t really know how to handle the limelight, but I suppose a lot of Irish people are like that. But it is great, and I’ve had so much good will, which sometimes you don’t realise because you live in a bubble where you think people aren’t thinking about you and then you are showered with all of this good will.

People still talk about him, and I don’t think there is that much rose-tinted glasses, as there can be when people aren’t about any more, but he was a very successful forward and good goal-scorer, and I remember kicking a ball with him in the back garden and going to games with him.“I remember the house being very busy with phonecalls and taking messages. I also remember going on holidays – we used to go camping every summer – so I have all of those good memories.”He continued: “He was a messer. He would have wound me up, he would have wound my brother and my sister up, and he would have been good fun about the house.“The older I get the more I appreciate it more from doing this type of job – although he would have been doing it in a dferent context than me – but I imagine that it would have brought a lot stress and challenges and I suppose going back to the house and winding the kids up and having a bit of craic was a way to unwind.”John was present with the rest of his family when loyalist gunmen broke into their Fortwilliam Drive home and murdered his father as they sat down to Sunday dinner. The “brutal” murder is still “very clear” to him as it changed his family’s lives forever. The proceeding years would be marked by the campaign for justice as they took on the British state.“I don’t even think I appreciate how taxing the campaign has been,” John admits.“My le growing up has been in the context of making allegations of collusion against the state in a time, from the early s onwards where the word collusion was a dirty word you were a republican propagandist. That was my normality.“It has taken me until my later years to appreciate that my mother was raising three kids, she was going to work and getting children up to get them ready for school, getting breakfast lunch and dinner ready – doing all of that having lost her husband. It has taken me a few years to realise the impact that it had on her, and that makes me appreciate and admire her a lot more than I already did.”Pat Finucane’s case is still under review by The Supreme Court as his family continue to fight for an inquiry. Asked about the signicance of the campaign for other victims of state violence, John said: “Something we have said from the very beginning of our campaign is that this apparatus and this policy that the British state had, which resulted in the deaths and the murders of so many people here, wasn’t just about Pat Finucane. They didn’t set this up just to kill my dad they killed people before him and they killed people after him.“I think it has been an example of what you can achieveyou are persistent and you have that support around you. We weren’t just a family, we had the support of NGOs, we had the support of investigative journalists, we had the support of governments and politicians. Whilst it hasn’t delivered in an inquiry, it has resulted in the word collusion having a very dferent context – people now accept that it happened and there is no longer a ‘few rotten apples in the barrel theory’ and it is no longer ‘republican propaganda’.”He continued: “The support that people have given us over the years, it’s very hard to put that into words. Whether it’s people talking about their memories of my father, people having encouraging words about our campaign, or attending events like this one in St Mary’s, it really provides us so much support.“It’s very humbling and we have always been grateful and we will remain truly grateful for that. My father came from a community that had very little and he wanted to use his education to make people’s lives much better, so for people to come out to remember and pay tribute to him means an awful lot to me and my family.”Sunday’s event will be held at pm in St Mary’s University College, Falls Road."},{"url":null,"title":"catholics to be majority of workforce in northern ireland for first time in 2020 new","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsSix NationsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeChristmas EditionCountdown To ChristmasHomes  InteriorsCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, unionist councillors voted down the motion, which would also have resulted in a council presence at the annual Belfast Pride Parade in August. Members of the DUP and Ulster Unionists rejected the plan and said they would not be taking lectures on equality from Sinn Fein. Last August, Sinn Fein spearheaded an attempt to fly rainbow flags on the councils premises to show support to LGBTQ+ citizens during Pride.Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon was set to make history by becoming the first council in Northern Ireland to fly the Pride flag above its three civic buildings.But the DUP invoked the call-in mechanism, which allows decisions to be reconsideredat least % of councillors request it.The DUP said strict procedures on flying flags and emblems hadnt been followed properly.The council then sought legal advice, which both the DUP and Sinn Fein claimed justied their stance. The row meant Pride Day last August passed without the flags in place. People taking part in the Belfast Pride parade set off from Custom House Square in central Belfast. Michael Cooper PA WireSinn Fein council group leader Darren McNally told the Ulster Gazette newspaper it was disappointing but not surprising that both unionist parties had voted against lighting up the civic buildings. He said: \"We have a erse community and the onus is on us to ensure we not only represent minority groups such as our LGBT community but that we make them feel valued, included, welcome and safe. \"Lighting up the civic buildings on Pride Day and an official presence at the parade is a forward-moving gesture - small but signicant - which would send out a clear message that ABC council are here for our LGBT community at a time when they are subject to hate attacks and left feeling isolated. \"In amending our original motion of the flying of the Pride flag, we were recognising that some parties are on a journey with regards to this particular issue. Other unionist councillors have supported similar motions in other councils.\"However, UUP councillor Jim Speers hit out at what he called the \"mischievous\" motion. He said: \"Sinn Feins actions go counter to the good working relationships we need at ABC Council. \"They are the last party that should be giving lectures on the need for equality. For a party which was linked to an organisation which terrorised this community for over  years to be talking about equality is disgusting.\"The DUPs Gareth Wilson accused Sinn Fein of \"blatant electioneering\".

These standard quality checks are carried out every three months, in line with UK best practice.The Western Trust said it immediately set up a review team, alerted the Public Health Agency and Department of Health and initiated the review process.  As a result of the review, a total of  women have been asked to arrange repeat smear test with their GP.Of the  women affected,  of them are from the Western Trust area,  women from the Belfast and South Eastern Trust areas and  women from the Republic of Ireland.Dr Dermot Hughes, Medical Director of the Western Trust, said: “The women affected will have received letters inviting them to contact their GP to arrange a repeat smear test. This does not necessarily mean that the results of their initial test were wrong the repeat test is a precautionary measure to provide reassurance that all women are being followed up appropriately.“I understand that this may cause worry and inconvenience for the women affected and I sincerely apologise for this. I would like to reassure everyone that the samples that were reviewed were a small percentage of those screened and reported between April  and June .“The stringent quality checks that are in place have reassured us that it was only a certain number of tests within this timeframe that were required to be re-examined.” ‘Le-saving’Sinn Féin Councillor Caoimhe McKnight has said her party has requested an urgent meeting with the Western Trust.The Derry councillor recently encouraged local women to have regular Smear Tests as she reflected on her own experience with the “le-saving” procedure.Cllr. McKnight said: “I can speak from experience when I say that a Smear Test could literally save your le.  When living in Scotland at the age of , which is the age there at which you are eligible for a smear, I received the notication of my eligibility and advised to avail of it.“But like many young women I put it off for a couple of months before finally going for the test.  When I tell you how grateful I am that I made the decision to have the test it is no exaggeration.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“It was luckythat I made the decision to have the test as they found abnormal cells.  I dread to think what I may have been toldI had to wait until the age of  before being tested.“After treatment and a few yearly smears everything is now fine and I am now in the normal  year test cycle.”She said it will be a “distressing” time for the women recalled but urged them all to contact their GPs to schedule a repeat smear test as soon as possible.\"While the Western Trust have said that this is a precautionary measure it will still cause concern and worry so it is important the affected women do not face undue delay in receiving a repeat test.\"In June ,  women in Belfast and Newtownabbey were also invited to attend for repeat smear test after the Public Health Agency were made aware of concerns identied in April that year.\"As I understand it, the Western Trust’s review of cervical smear tests concerned those in April and June , but it is not clearthere is a connection with what happened in Belfast and Newtownabbey in June and this recent action by the Western Trust.\"Sinn Féin have requested an urgent meeting with the Western Trust and we will be raising these concerns directly with them,\" she added.‘Mistakes’Meanwhile, SDLP councillor Angela Dobbins told women to call the Western Trust helpline, to allay any concerns.Cllr Dobbins commented: “This is not the first time mistakes have been made in regards to cervical screening laboratories lessons should and must be learnt from issues both in the South and in England.“Undoubtedly this recall will be a cause of concern for many women. However, I must stress the fact that only a fraction of those tested between April to June  were affected and will receive letters this week to arrange a repeat test with their GP.“This does not necessarily indicate that initial results were incorrect, rather the recall is a precautionary measure intended to allay concerns.”The Western Trust has advised the affected women thatthey have any concerns or want further information, they should contact the Western Trust’s Laboratory Department on   , from Tuesday  February to Wednesday  February between am to pm."},{"url":null,"title":"walled city story light derrys tower museum","story":"This weekend all eyes will be on the Tower Museum in Derry as the story of the Walls comes alive through a series of images projected onto the building’s historic façade over the weekend.The projections are part of a year-long series of events celebrating the th anniversary of the completion of the city’s iconic Walls, organised by Derry City and Strabane District Council and its partners The Honourable, The Irish Society - the builders and owners of the Walls - and the Department for Communities Historic Environment Division.The images feature a series of beautul hand sketches by local artist Seán Ó Brógáin commissioned by the Council during the th year anniversary of the Plantation.

August and the opening of the Carlingford Lough Greenway from Newry to Victoria Lock in July demonstrate our councilrsquos commitment to improving our arearsquos attractions and environment.Mr Hannaway said that in the coming year Newry and its Cathedral Corridor would see pound, for improvements, festive lighting and events, to building on what has already been achieved in these locations.His focus also turned to Brexit, explaining that as the March  deadline for leaving edges ever closer, the councilrsquos relationships with government departments, the EU, cross border bodies and institutions across Ireland and Britain will become even more important as it seeks to improve the district.ldquoThese partnerships will remain a priority for the coming year as we deliver initiatives, programmes and services for all the people living, working and investing in our district, he continued.ldquoSome of the projects that will be progressed during the   year include further revitalisation of Warrenpoint, with pound, for town improvements, including shop fronts, new signage and a promotional and marketing campaign.ldquoThe council has also secured approval for the Ballynahinch bypass, a plan that will greatly improve access throughout the area and relieve the traffic congestion in the town centre.Mr Hannaway said plans for the southern relief road in Newry will be progressed after the preferred route was announced and was confident that developing a strategic link road between the A Dublin Road and the A Warrenpoint Road mdash a project that the council is working on with Stormont officials ndash will contribute to increasing the economy of the whole region.He said improving public services and the way they were implemented was another important goal for the council in the new financial year, revealing that five ambitious performance improvement objectives had been identied.They include encouraging healthy lestyles, improving economic growth and promoting the district as a premier tourist destination, delivering urban and rural regeneration initiatives, creating a cleaner, greener district, and encouraging and empowering local communities to work with the Council to deliver on its programmes.ldquoOver the coming months, the council will be working with local groups to ensure that their views on how best to implement these important goals, he confirmed.ldquoOver the coming year, the historic town of Downpatrick will benefit from a new public realm improvement scheme as part of the Masterplan which will be delivered in partnership with the Department for Communities and the Department for Infrastructure.Mr Hannaway said the district continued to benefit from EU funding, with pound.m being provided to South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which promotes economic growth and job creation in coastal and inland communities.Under the PEACE IV programme pound.m had been allocated to the council to deliver the Local Authority Action PlanmdashBeyond Tolerance in the three key areas of children and young people, shared spaces and services, and building positive relationships.Projects funded under this initiative include an

the table to nine points when they condemned Killough to the also rans category at The Links, Strangford on Saturday.Killough, who have been forced go play their home games anywhere they can as the Mill Field undergoes further repairs, could easily have collected three points with a resolute second half display, but Ballynagross closed up shop after taking - lead at the end of the first half.Both sides settled quickly with the excellent playing surface encouraging players to keep the ball on the floor. It was Ballynagross, who didnrsquot seem to miss the suspended Matthew Rooney and Declan Dowie too much, that drew first blood in the fth minute.The dashing Eoin Rooney, who was making his first team debut following a recent move from Downpatrick FC, took full advantage of a failed offside call from Killough, sped past Stevie Laverty and beat new lsquokeeper Peter Kelly with a clinical finish.Killough retaliated immediately with Michael Burns, Gareth George and Tony McIhone prodding patiently from the middle of the park and when an opening came, Declan Looney, a team-mate of Eoin Rooney at Downpatrick not that long ago, put the burners on and rled a sweet equaliser past Conor McCullough, a former Killough lsquokeeper, from just inside the box.As expected from a derby clash, no quarter was asked or given and it took a few yellow cards to bring the combatants under control before Daniel Taggart popped up in the box to restore the visitorsrsquo lead with a poacherrsquos finish.Killough tried to get back on level terms with Freddie OrsquoConnor raiding down the flank and Ross Armstrong working overtime in a bid to create something of note. However, a Ballynagross back four of Conor Marron, John Shields, Aaron Beattie and Gary Carberry were in dominant form and they steadfastly refused to give way.Karl Gelstonrsquos side was more than happy to hit Killough on the break and midway through the first half, assassin Donal McCavera gave them a - lead as Killough were caught chasing the game.Killough had to throw caution to the wind and pulled a goal back just before the break when the dangerous McIlhoneexploded into le when he drilled in a beauty to give his side every chance of getting a result.The second half, although as equally as combative, never reached the dizzy heights of the first  minutes with two well-matched sides cancelling each other out in a midfield war of attrition.Chances were few and far between with the respective defences on top. Killough again did the chasing, but there was just no way past Carberry and Beattie and lsquokeeper McCullough did all that was asked of him.The longer the game went on, the deeper Ballynagross defended, but in the final analysis, Killough just didnrsquot have the necessary firepower to break them down.Killough: Peter Kelly, Colm Kearney, Stevie Laverty, Jason Clarke, Kevin Groves, Tony McIlhone, Michael Burns, Freddie OrsquoConnor, Declan Looney, Ross Armstrong, Gareth George.

It literally became a tidal wave of women going, lsquoYes Me Too, Yes Me Too, Yes Me Toorsquo.ldquoSexual assault is everywhere.It has been normalised. It has been accepted. Until we are shining a proper light on this, we need this to happen.ldquoIt has always been that way. Where did the phrase the casting coach come from  It is as old as the hills. It is accepted language. Because it is accepted language, do we have to accept that some women are going to have to be violated in order to get ahead in the industry ldquoI think its is abhorrent and I think that the way that women are portrayed on screen and how they are treated in the industry is rightly changing.However, McGrady, who is a former student of Assumption Grammar School in Ballynahinch, defended the storyline behind The Fall which shows Jamie Dornan playing Phil Spector, a serial killer of young women.ldquoI thought it was an excellent examination at to what would compel a man to violence against women, she said.The youngest of five children, McGrady also talks about feeling ldquodeeply emotional about the Mourne Mountains.She also touches on her need as a young girl to leave Castlewellan once she had left school ldquofor some adventure anywhere and how she has experienced mental health problems in the past with feelings of anxiety and depression.McGrady, who is now married and living in London, also speaks of the ups and downs of her acting career and how after she performed Macbeth with Sir Patrick Stewart in the West End and on Broadway in New York, she ed to London to work in a club.bull Eamonn Mallie mdash Face to Facehellipwith Niamh McGrady airs on UTV on Tuesday at .pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Centenary celebrations for Hollymount Pipe Band anniversary  ","story":"THERErsquoS a saying around these parts by those who know mdash lsquotherersquos two things you canrsquot get away from, farming and pipe bandsrsquo.Born just after the ending of the Great War in  and reformed after World War Two in , Hollymount Pipe Band is marking its centenary this year.It was the first pipe band formed in the Lecale district and sadly, it is the only one remaining out of eight.While the faces have changed over the years, therersquos one thing that hasnrsquot and thatrsquos the deep-rooted family connections between its members over the decades.Despite the advert of streamed TV box-sets, the internet and smart phone that increasingly take up much of our spare time, family ties between the generations remain strong here.In , there were six father-son combinations playing in the band which practices at Hollymount Orange Hall on the Woodgrange Road just outside Downpatrick.Today, within its -strong ranks, aged from three years to , are four father-child relationships with lead drummer Ronnie Steele going for the record with three of his four young daughters in the band.Sammy Strain is the bandrsquos elder statesman. He has a proud direct lineage to the band when it first started out  years ago. His great-uncle, James Strain of Woodgrange, was the bandrsquos first pipe major.He also has pipes dating back to the early days of the band, a much-prized piece of heritage along with the framed photographs of former pipe band members and lodge members which line the walls of the Orange Hall.James Strain was taught by the bandrsquos first piping instructor, William Maxwell from Newcastle, who used to travel by train to Tullymurry on the Ballydugan Road and then arrive by bicycle or horse and cart to the hall.Sammy, who joined the band when he was seven, says, as do other members, that his introduction into the pipe band world was a natural extension of his family le.ldquoIt was actually my cousin who taught me the pipes even though my father Sam was pipe major at the time, he said.ldquoI joined in  and played my first Twelfth in Newcastle in  when I was nine. At that time I was playing whatrsquos called a three-quarter set of pipes.ldquoI canrsquot remember being askedI wanted to join but as my great-grandfather was one of the first members, it was just in the family. It was just handed down, it was taken for granted, more or less, that you were going to learn the pipes.ldquoWhen we started out, there really was nothing  so the band was number one. Itrsquos dficult now to keep a band going with so many other things for the young ones to be doing, so how we managed to keep a band going  years, I do not know.From head to toe, it can cost from between pound to pound, to kit out an adult pipe band member in full unorm and around pound for child members.The unorm has always represented a major investment mdash in addition to practice and competition timemdash for any member.In his history of the band on its th anniversary, Sammy recounted the lower end of a quotation given for a new unorm in  coming in at  pounds  shillings, which is equivalent to around pound today.The retired farmer has been with the band during the worst and the best of times.ldquoWe went through a lean period in the late Eighties and we werenrsquot contesting then. We started contesting in  and then again about five or six years ago, he said.ldquoThe best time of the band I can recall was in  when I retired as pipe major. My cousin, Francey Strain, took the band over and as we had a lot of young ones then, those were the best years up until  where we went to the World Pipe Band Championships in Cowal and we were upgraded three times in that time.The best of times for Hollymount was when they came runners-up in their grade B at the World Championships on their first entry into the competition.Ronnie Steele recalls: ldquoWe were very nearly not going but decided at the last minute so it was a real rush to try and book the boat and to find somewhere for us all to stay.Hollymount achieved their biggest achievement to date on one of the blackest days in Northern Ireland history mdash the day of the Omagh bombing on August ,.While the band continued throughout the  years of the Troubles, it emerged unscathed, according to Ronnie, who adds: ldquoThrough all the Troubles we had never any bother down here we never missed anything out.Another strong family connection belongs to pipe major Sam Gill ndash whose maternal uncle is Sammy Strain. His two sons, Jackand seven year-old Charlie, are in the band. When the  year-old isnrsquot at the band or at work as a mechanic, he continues to perfect his skill as a former world ploughing champion and the winner of the NI title for  years.ldquoMy father, Raymond, played in the band as did my twin brother, David, who now plays for Drumlough Pipe Band.ldquoWhen I joined at the age of eight, it was just a matter in those days that after my father came home from work and got a bit of dinner, he would have say, rsquoRight, I take you up to the bandrsquo.ldquoSammy Strain taught me the notes on a blackboard whereas now you have the likes of Ronniersquos daughter, Christie, who records me on her phone playing and she practice.Ronnie shares his love of the band with daughters Christie , Ashleyand three year-old Megan. No doubt his youngest, one year-old Alexandra, will be drafted in a few years time.Piper Ryan Green, who used to play for the former Seaforde and Woodgrange Pipe Bands, has also introduced his  year-old son, Matthew, while piper Robert Neill plays alongside his  year-old daughter Laura.Sometimes the pull towards piping and Hollymount misses a generation. However, the family influence remains strong as in the case of siblings Jessica and Thomas Watson, whose great grandfather, David Stranney, was in the band, although their parents werenrsquot.But the members know that keeping the band going for the next generation is an even greater challenge today than it was  years ago.They are delighted that it currently has  members aged  and under in the band.Apart from marching in the annual Twelfth celebrations, the main activity for the band is performing at local concerts where it has raised more than pound, in recent years for charities.Sam Gill says that the next big push, once some of the younger members are ready for it, will be to start competing in contests again, although they know it may take some time to reach their former B grade.ldquoTherersquos still a hunger to try and get the band to be as good as possible. The problem we have mdash and any band will tell you the same mdash is trying to keep the young ones interested becauseyou donrsquot, they will leave, he added.ldquoBands like ours are often recruitment bands for other larger ones but we would dearly love to see more experienced band members joining Hollymount and passing on their experience to the next generation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Contractors continue with leisure centre demolition  ","story":"WORK is progressing at pace to demolish the old Down Leisure Centre in Downpatrick.Contractors are razing the old building to the ground as its poundm replacement continues to break membership records, with additional staff drafted in to cope with the volume of people coming through the doors.Four decades after the old centre opened, it is being reduced to a pile of rubble as the soaraway success of its ultra-modern replacement continues, with users flocking in their droves and membership doubling within a week.The old centre was the first major leisure complex built in the district and was one of the most modern of its kind when the doors opened for business, boasting a new swimming pool and a suite of other facilities, including a large sports hall.Contractors in charge of the demolition began work shortly before Christmas and over the past few weeks have made signicant progress.The old sports hall has been razed to the ground with contractors currently using heavy equipment to demolish the old swimming pools and reception area.The old centre was a major community hub and in addition to meeting the districtrsquos leisure needs, the large hall hosted many community events including public rallies, former Down Council election counts, drama productions and even concerts featuring a host of local artists.While the centre had long since passed its sell-by-date, the former Down Council was keen to replace it and the work the local authority started was completed by its successor, Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The old centre closed for the final time at the end of November,  years after it opened. Within a week of its multi-million pound replacement opening for business, membership numbers doubled.The stunning new three-storey facility boasts a range of facilities which would rival any of those more commonly found in leisure complexes attached to five star hotels.Boasting ultra-modern equipment, the magnicent and futuristic , square metre centre heralds an exciting new dawn in the history of leisure provision across the district with facilities including an  station wellness gymnasium featuring the latest equipment.There is also a -station spin studio, -metre six-lane swimming pool, luxury vitality health suite including a sauna, steam room and vitality pool.

We have more quality control on our beef and that is what makes it high grade. This leaves us in a very dficult position because we cannot produce our beef for any less than we already do.ldquoOur fear is that, in the event of a lsquono dealrsquo and there isnrsquot enough UK beef to satisfy demand, they will look at bringing in beef from outside of the UK. If itrsquos brought in at a cheaper price it could very well leave us in a tight spot.Mr Rice, whose family has been in farming for generations, continued: ldquoBeef and lamb have been subsidised by the EU indirectly in the form of Single Farm Payments. Dairy, pork and chicken are already at world prices and can already compete. They will not see such a big fluctuation whereas we will be more exposed.ldquoIf Prime Minister Teresa May were to step in and take over the subsidies, the outlook looks favourable in the short term.ldquoBut when a boat load of beef comes in from Brazil then almost certainly subsidies will be reduced and wersquoll be paid to maintain the landscape. In other words wersquoll be reduced to gardeners.Describing Brexit as the ldquobiggest peacetime emergency in almost a century, Ballynahinch farmer Barry Higgins said the uncertainty of the situation did not do farmers any favours.ldquoWe feel itrsquos more of a back lash than a back stop, he remarked, adding that he hoped no farmers would be forced out of business.Dessie Canavan, from Kilcoo, said farmers were being ldquodragged into Brexit against their will.ldquoIt is unfair for us to compete against the likes of Brazil and Argentina, he remarked. ldquoDepending on the size of our farm, sometimes we are forced out into part-time jobs to subsidise our income. And thatrsquos before Brexit comes into force. There is much to be concerned about.A spokesman for Downpatrick Co Operative Marketing Ltd said its role was to respect the views of all its shareholders and customers, who are farmers.He added: ldquoOur business relies solely on the trading of livestock both locally and outside Northern Ireland and we are therefore concerned about the impact Brexit will have on our daily business and the local faming community we serve.ldquoAs part of a democratic society we respect the peoplersquos vote to leave the EU, but we are also aware the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain.ldquoWe now have a situation with two main options mdash either crash out or negotiate a deal to leave. Our main fear with the crash out option is that it exposes us all to a greater risk of casualties rather than survivors.ldquoOver the past  months Teresa May has been trying tirelessly to negotiate a Brexit deal with the EU that represents and respects all the people within the UK.The spokesman said: ldquoAll we ask is the same respect is given to any deal which identies and supports the uniqueness of trading and faming in Northern Ireland. Businesses and farmers are very good at adapting to change in whatever form it comes but at present, with no clear decision on Brexit, the ongoing development of any business has been affected.The Ulster Farmersrsquo Union is also concerned at the prospect of a lsquono dealrsquo Brexit UFU president Ivor Ferguson added: ldquoWe respect the referendum result and that the UK will leave the EU. However, the uncertainty is very damaging.ldquoWith March  less than  days away decisions need to be taken urgently and a deal agreed. Leaving the EU without a deal would be catastrophic for Northern Irelandrsquos farming families and their businesses.ldquoNo deal means high tarfs on our exports creating an effective trade embargo and the possibility of lower standard imports flooding the UK market.ldquoThese practical issues will have an immediate and profound impact on farmers, causing major disruptions to the supply chain, crippling the industry and rendering our farmers uncompetitive..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C February 6%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash A Ballynahinch headmaster hit out at the education authorities this week for the lack of permanent accommodation at his school where two thirds of the pupils are in wooden huts.Mr Harry Bent said St Colmanrsquos High School had been promised a major extension, but was unlikely to get it ldquoas long as comprehensive education is the policy of the Government.Speaking at the schoolrsquos annual prize day, Mr Bent said it angered him that the provision of accommodation had not kept pace with the growing numbers and successes of pupils.ldquoIn St Colmanrsquos nine temporary classrooms accommodate  pupils out of a total of , he said. ldquoThis means that almost two thirds of our pupils are in temporary accommodation which was first erected as a temporary measure ten years ago.Mr Bent stressed temporary classrooms may solve a financial problem for the Government, but there was so substitute for normal school accommodation.ldquoAt least  of the  subjects on the secondary curriculum are practical subjects, such as domestic science. Temporary classrooms make no provision for these subjects, which form over half of the curriculum, he explained.The headmaster told parents that since the school opened  years ago, with accommodation for  pupils, no extra provision had been made for practical subjects to facilitate the pupils now on the roll.ldquoNo matter which way the problem of accommodation is resolved the pupils are being discriminated against in regard to the subjects they can choose, he continued.ldquoFor  years chairs and tables have had to be carried in and out for the gymnasium and for  years the Department of Education has turned a deaf ear to the pleas of both the management and the South Eastern Education Board.DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos Marlene Fitzsimons is to represent Northern Ireland in the finals of the Miss British Legion contest in England in May.Marlene, representing the Downpatrick branch, won the Northern Ireland heats in the county town on Friday night and will now travel to the national finals to be held in Brighton.Miss Fitzsimons, from Roughal Park, beat entries from Dungannon, Omagh and Belfast, as well as last yearrsquos winner, Andrea Quinn, from Comber.The four points that the judges were looking for were Legion knowledge, Legion involvement, poise and appearance, and diction and clarity of expression.MOURNES mdash Newcastlersquos Shimna River has been ped as one of the water extraction rivers for the proposed new multi-million-pound reservoir at Kinnahalla in the Mourne Mountains.The news, announced late last night from Stormont, will be welcomed in Newcastle where there have been fears that the Shimna would dry upwater was taken for the new scheme.ldquoIt has been decided not to proceed with the abstraction intake on the Shimna River because of the possible affect a further abstraction might have on the river, said a spokesman for the Department of the Environment.ldquoIn addition the Department has agreed that a residual flow of water from the Fofanny reservoir should now be provided for the upper reaches of the Shimna and Fofanny rivers which will result in improvement downstream, especially in times of low flows and will also ensure that the amenity value of the Shimna to Tollymore Forest Park will be retained.Newcastle councillor Paddy OrsquoDonoghue said the announcement would be seen as a major victory for people opposed to the proposal.The new reservoir, which is being built on the upper reaches of the Bann downstream from the existing Spelga reservoir, will help meet the growing demand in the Belfast area, which is now approaching  million gallons a day and will also augment supplies to those parts of Co Down not at present supplied from existing Mourne sources.ARDGLASS mdash The badly decomposed body of a man was found on the rocks at Sheepland, Ardglass, on Monday morning.

The front door still has its peep hole and numerous locks, but the interior certainly does not resemble a station. The cells have become the kitchen and the remaining rooms have been completely renovated.Because of its similarity with other police stations the current owners have had several amusing incidents when people have called looking for directions, or asking for stray drunks to be locked up for the night.A spokesman for the estate agents agreed that it was one of the most unusual buildings to appear on the property market and added that it would suit anyone worried about security problems!NEWCASTLE mdash Provisional plans for Newcastlersquos summer fun programme mdash the centrepiece of Down Districtrsquos holiday entertainment mdash are already being drawn up.Newcastle Town Committee mdash the local body which co-ordinates the summer programme mdash held its annual convention last week and preparations for this yearrsquos programme got underway.Members of the town committee have pledged their determination to make this yearrsquos event even bigger and better than before.

The only exception would be when sensitive information is being discussed, he said. ldquoNo reasoning was given as to why the CIL visit should have been in private.Councillor Dermot Curran said the event should have been held in the ldquofull glare of the public and asked why more meetings were now being arranged mdash at the ratepayersrsquo expense mdash when one open to all councillors, the press and the public would have been sufficient.Slieve Croob councillor John Rice also expressed concern that only elected representatives were able to hear from the Commissioners.ldquoThis meeting was about a lighthouse and it was ridiculous that the public, in particular those campaigning to retain the beam, were not permitted to listen to the debate, he added.Cllr Cadogan Enright, whose proposal that reporters and the public should have been admitted was defeated, believes there was no reason to exclude them. He claimed the attitude of ldquohiding what was going on in council was becoming too common and needed to be stopped.ldquoTransparency in council is the best way to win public trust, he declared. ldquoThe Commissioners said they are not proposing to take away the existing apparatus except for the mercury bath. They propose putting a new rotating LED beam on the top of the lighthouse to demonstrate that they were listening to local people and plan to bring this all to consultation later in the year.Cllr Enright said the Commissioners confirmed that Newry, Mourne and Down Council could bring forward a partnership with a local preservation group in a manner similar to what happened at Loop Head lighthouse in Co Clare.A council spokesman said: ldquoThis workshop was a preliminary information session for councillors and prior to any plans being finalised or put in place for St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse, a wide ranging public consultation is planned, he said.The spokesman added: ldquoCouncillors present also agreed to invite officers from the Commissioner of Irish Lights to a joint DEA Forum meeting to ensure information can be shared and that local stakeholders and communities are fully consulted upon any proposals for the lighthouse in the immediate future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Magical Mooney conjures up late%2C late winner  ","story":"DOWN were forced to rely on an eleventh hour intervention from Caolan Mooney to get over the line at Connolly Park, Sligo, on Sunday.The Rostrevor governor swooped in added time to turn a - to - deficit into a winning scenario with a sensational last-gasp goal to give Paddy Tallyrsquos charges their first win of the campaign.It all looked so bleak for the visitors for most of the game as Sligo dominated the exchanges, but Down hung on grimly and Mooney saved the day four minutes into added time.Sligo started in a hurry and points from Pat Hughes and Liam Gaughan gave the hosts a - to - lead after five minutes.Hughes slammed in a quick goal to increase Sligorsquos lead to five points before Paul Devlin registered Downrsquos first score with a converted free in the eighth minute.Further unanswered points from Pat Havern and Ryan and Jerome Johnston brought Down to within a point of the home side midway through the first half.

He said the review will not be completed until December.Cllr Curran said Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie were at the heart of their respective communities and that new investment was required to allow them to develop.ldquoWhile I welcome the planned review, I am concerned at how long it will take to complete. In addition, how will any recommendations around future investment for example be implemented in the absence of a ing Stormont Assembly  he asked.Newry, Mourne and Down Council has agreed to make pound, to assist with plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour, helping secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry.The local authority is making the cash available to the recently formed Ardglass harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals to help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ardglass.The money has been earmarked to help the new group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use.Cllr Curran said many people were eager to read the conclusions of the government departmentrsquos review, particularly in the context of a post-Brexit scenario.He added: ldquoAt this point in time all those within the fishing sector in particular are looking at the ongoing discussions around Brexit and wondering what any final decision will have on an already heavily regulated industry.Meanwhile, Ardglass Golf Club is the venue for a special event next Wednesday, February , when funding opportunities under the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund support programme will be outlined during an information session which runs between am and .pm.The funding initiative is designed to support a broad range of projects that focus on promoting economic growth through job creation and social inclusion in coastal and inland communities which depend on fishing and aquaculture.This includes the ersication of activities within fisheries and into other sectors of the maritime economy with the pound.m funding cake being administered by the South East Area Fisheries Local Action Group which comprises representatives from the public, private and voluntary sectors within the Newry, Mourne and Down and Ards and North Down council areas.The projects eligible for financial support must must demonstrate how they will impact on fishing dependent communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Spa’s James and Kirsty dance to success  ","story":"YOUNG farmers from all over Co Down descended upon a Belfast hotel recently for this yearrsquos star-studded grand final of Strictly Young Farmers.More usually associated with Simmentals and Shorthorns the Strictly contestants showed they were equally at home with a good salsa or a samba on stage at the Crown Plaza Hotel in a bid to win the much revered glitter ball.The event sponsored by Barclays, saw Young Farmersrsquo clubs from all over Co Down welcome a crowd of over , made up of sponsors, family and friends, to support this yearrsquos dancers.The enthusiastic audience were dazzled with a vast array of steps and styles including the cha cha cha, jive, charleston, paso doble and American smooth.In preparation for the big night the committed couples underwent a strict regime every Monday evening since last November.Following much swinging, sweat and a lot of fake tan the couples were well able to showcase their talent at the annual event to raise funds for Alzheimerrsquos Society and local Young Farmersrsquo clubs.The event was hosted by past YFCU president Roberta Simmons, of Rathfriland YFC, past YFCU vice-president Harry Crosby, of Spa YFC, and current YFCU vice-president Andrew Patton, from Newtownards YFC.Assisting with the eveningrsquos entertainment were judges Karen Patterson from the BBC and past Young Farmer, James Trotman, Agri Manager for Barclays, Janet Plunkett, Fundraising Manager for Alzheimerrsquos Society in Northern Ireland, and Zita McNaugher, current YFCU deputy president.Competing couples George Porter and Laura Sproule, Matthew Ney and Rebecca Nelson, Chris Reid and Sarah Robinson, Harry Walker and Emma Connolly, James Gilpin and Emma McAnea, Ward Patterson and Sarah Reid, Richard Kennedy and Jessica Lee, Harry Hamilton and Louise McAnea, Graham Annett and Sarah Graham wowed the crowd with their twinkle toes.However, it was James McCauley and Kirsty Burrows, from Spa YFC, who danced their way to the top with their energetic charleston to be crowned Strictly winners .The organising committee, led by Co Down YFC chairperson Linzi Stewart and secretary Kristina McKeag, thanked everyone who helped make the night such a success, particularly sponsors, hosts, judges, family and friends and last but not least the dancers, who were the stars of the show..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17396017.rural-bus-service-to-change-due-to-stormont-impasse/resources/images/9357472.jpg","title":"outstanding quality at second calf fair","story":"Breed judges from throughout the UK and Ireland were unanimous in their praise for the Pedigree Calf Fair and Beef NI Expo, held at the Balmoral Showgrounds in Belfast on SaturdaySpeaking after the one-day show, which featured three show rings and  native and continental beef breeds, event organiser and Chairman, David Connolly said: ldquoItrsquos been another fantastic event, and we certainly exceeded our strap-line lsquoBigger and Betterrsquo.ldquoThe  show has surpassed last yearrsquos inaugural event, attracting hundreds of spectators and more than  trade exhibits.

Brexiteers may claim that like other lsquoProject Fearrsquo predictions the anticipated damage to house prices has not been felt but I suspect they will be a bit more muted in a years time.If the Government negotiates a deal with the EU before March nothing will change until December , .The overriding answer seems to be that there is too much uncertainty at the moment soyou feel it is the right time to move, do it.Read more: Should I renew my EHIC card or will Brexit make it invalid But what about mortgages In  the Bank of Englandrsquos Monetary Policy committee increased rates to . per cent in August, so could Brexit impact on this David Hollingworth, mortgage expert at London  Country said: ldquoThe direction of travel for rates has been a gradual increase but like any forecast for , itrsquos impossible to avoid the question of Brexit and how that might influence rate movements.ldquoIf the exit is a disorderly one there could be further weakening in the pound, resulting in upward pressure on inflation.ldquoHigher inflation would typically be countered by higher interest rates but itrsquos also possible that the Bank will look through that and could even cut ratesit feels that the economy is in need of support, just as it did following the referendum in .ldquoThe mortgage market remains very competitive, so borrowers have the chance to take action and remove any guesswork by fixing their rate at a competitive level.The HomeOwners Alliance champions the interests of Britains homeowners and aspiring homeowners, providing unbiased and practical advice as well as services you can trust whether you are buying, selling or owning your home.

I canrsquot see that there is any way the council can fix this, there just isnrsquot the infrastructure.ldquoItrsquos obvious that it is not going to work, it would be a waste of money to even try it.But another Plassey Street resident, Bat Goddard, said: ldquoTo spend pound, on an experiment, which in  months they could reject, is ludicrous.ldquoWe have the widest street in Penarth here but they want to turn it in to a one-way system.ldquoWe need to stop this folly now.Vale council member Geoff Cox, who is the cabinet member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, has since said a report will be put forward that retains the roundabout and instead looks at enhancing other ideas to solve crossing issues and traffic problems.Cllr Coxsaid: ldquoAs the Cabinet meeting date approached, I became more aware of the strength of local feeling associated with the highway option being proposed, hence my decision to defer the report meaning it was not even considered by Cabinet on January .ldquoI have since reviewed the ious options further, which has included my meeting with local ward members to obtain their detailed views on all options. I now intend to present an amended report to cabinet on February .ldquoThe report will propose that option one in the previous report now be taken forward, which retains the current roundabout though enhances the gateway route into Penarth whilst providing much safer crossing opportunities for cyclists and pedestrians. There is no requirement to complete any spending on this project by the end of this financial year.ldquoIt is very dficult to please everyone with highway improvement schemes but I very much hope that this option provides the active travel benefits we are seeking and is viewed by residents and visitors to Penarth as being the most appropriate. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was made with willow grown in the grounds of Cogan Primary School.More than  people attended the hill rolling ceremony down Clf Hill towards Penarth Esplanade - with the school pupils from Cogan and pupils and families from Ysgol Pen Y Garth helping to roll it along.The head was accompanied by a wooden frame from the Mabinogion stories called the Window of Sorrows made by Tony Simms, and the artist Ifor Davies undertook the ritual sawing of the Window of Sorrows on the clftops and read the Bendigeidfran story from the Mabinogion tales before the rolling went ahead.The head of Bendigeidfran and the Window of Sorrows was accompanied by Penarths Mari Lwyd which is a symbol of hosting, and negotiating hospitality through song and teasing. Richard Parry led the Mari Lwyd this year, and on arriving at the bottom of the hill the celebration visited local shops and resaurants along the sea front wishing the proprietors and customers a Happy New Year. We sang for Romeo Italian restaurant, The Fig Tree, James Sommerin, The Crazy Cafe and Hamptons seaside shop. After reaching the bottom of the hill the head was carried by the children along with the Mari Lwyd to the shops and cafes along the seafront where dferent New Year songs - called Calenig - were sung in each venue and led by local opera singer Richard Parry.Speaking about the event, artist Haf Weighton said: \"I loved working with Cogan School. Itrsquos a hidden gem in Penarth with very enthusiastic staff who were happy to jump in to get involved in this project at short notice. Richard Parry and the schools deputy head Tom Lewis, ran a assembly to the whole school on the new year traditions. Then children from across the school came to see me working on the piece. \"It was lovely to hear children who donrsquot come from homes where Welsh is spoken enthusing about the mabinogi tales and Welsh traditions. Children from Pen y Garth joined in after the head was created. They helped us roll it down the hill from the clf tops.\"Richard Parry, who helped to organise the event and led the Mari Lwyd, said: \"It was great to see so many people come together to celebrate Hen Galan in Penarth. The giant Bendegeidfran got his name because he was the Blessed Bran - the best friend anyone could ever want - and in the stories of the Mabinogion he was loved by those who knew him. He is a symbol of friendship and celebrating together. \"The community celebration on the clftops was thoroughly enjoyed by children and adults alike, and even though its a bit chilly it was wonderful to see so many people out of doors, celebrating, singing and enjoying wishing everyone we met Blwyddyn Newydd Dda and Happy New Year.\"The head will now go on display at a iety of places, including Pen y Garth School, Cogan Primary School, Penarth Library and The Hearth Gallery Llandough Hospital. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The deaths has been reported to the coroner.It comes as almost , patient accidents or falls were reported between November  and December .Of the five unexpected deaths to patients known to mental health services, one was found hanging at home but the cause of deaths of the other patients are not yet confirmed.One dental patient was diagnosed withsquamous cell carcinoma ndash a form of skin cancer ndash having previously been downgraded from urgent to routine.Another patient suffered a stroke after ldquofollow-up processes were not followed and had not started blood thinning treatment, while another patient died whilst on the cardiac surgery waiting list.In another serious incident, an eye disorder patientrsquos sight ldquodeteriorated signicantly after not being offered a follow-up appointment.A regulation  report ndash which is sent to organisations when a coroner believes that action should be taken to prevent further deaths ndash has also been sent to the health board since the end of November.The report relates to an inquest in which the coroner concluded that a patient died after taking a deliberate overdose of his prescribed medication on an in-patient ward at University Hospital of Wales.The medication was not locked away in his bedside cupboard, which contravened the medicines code patient property policies, a health board report says.The health board report says: ldquoThe management of patientrsquos own medication is one which presents a particular challenge in the healthcare environment. Following the incident the UHB has carried out a benchmarking exercise across the UK and it does not appear that there is anyone centre that has managed to put an effective solution in place.ldquoWhile patients are always encouraged to hand over all medication or to send it home with family, there are many practical issues that make this dficult to implement and monitor robustly. Medication is the patientrsquos own property and they can refuse to hand it over should they wish. Staff would of course always have a discussion with the patient and the family with regards to the risk.ldquoIt is not possible for staff to monitor patientsrsquo property on a continuous basis and there are occasions when family members bring in additional property for patients while they are in hospital and this may include medication.ldquoThe UHB has submitted a response to the coroner and will continue to benchmark in order to find an effective solution.No new lsquoNever Eventsrsquo took place between November and December.Of the , falls reported betweenNovember  and December , % resulted in no harm, or minor harm.In December , more than  falls were reported ndash but this was the lowest monthly figure for that period.The health board is developing a strategy to reduce falls and reviewing prevention and management of bed sores.New guidance from the Welsh Government will mean fewer pressure damage incidents will be reported as lsquoSerious Incidentsrsquo, a health board report says.Patient approval remains high with the arearsquos two main hospitals as surveys suggest % are satisfied with their experience atUniversity Hospital of Llandough, and % of patients are satisfied atUniversity Hospital of Wales.A spokeswoman for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: ldquoIn line with our duty of candour we report allseriousincidentsto Welsh Government, the public and to our board in line with best practice.ldquoWelsh Government guidance requires us to report unexpected deaths of patients who are known to mental health services and die unexpectedly or experienceseriousharm in a community setting. Patients and their families are made aware ofincidentsand are kept informed during investigations and discussions with our clinical teams.ldquoThe increased reporting of pressure damage reflects a period of education and training of staff to improve the quality of data being recorded.ldquoAllincidentsare fully investigated and appropriate actions are taken to reduce the risk of recurrence in the future. This enables clinical boards and the corporate teams to identy areas of good practice but also to identy emerging trends and issues that require action in order to improve safety and quality of services. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We tell client’s stories through engaging content written by former journalists – grab their customers’ attention with stunning design, maximise conversions by using the latest digital marketing expertise, and develop websites which are living, breathing, online stores or shop windows. As content director, my role is to bring almost  years’ experience in journalism, political communications, corporate PR, crisis management and digital content crafting to Grofuse. How did the business start and how has it grown The business was created by a fusion of expertise to achieve sales growth, including experienced digital marketers, PR consultants, web developers, software developers, graphic designers, illustrators and motion designers. I co-founded the company with expert digital marketer Denis Finnegan who has spent  years fuelling online lead generation for businesses. Growth has been swt over the last  months. We’ve employed an effective combination of marketing efforts and created fans of our existing clients.What is your background I’m a seasoned hack, having worked in print journalism for almost  years followed by a few years as a political communications adviser. I spent a brief period teaching English and history at secondary level before entering a newsroom. The working environments were poles apart in terms pace, excitement and... language choices. As a school pupil and university student, I worked on building sites, supermarkets, farms, bars, bread delivery vans, a bakery and even a bacon factory kill-line. However, I had never encountered such flurries of expletives as I did in newsrooms. Great places to work. High pressure, tight deadlines and great target-setting – a superb way to fuel productivity in any work environment.What do you do dferently from your competition and what are your strengths Clear communication with our clients is our greatest strength. We listen intently to what our clients’ goals are, take time to learn about their products and gain full understanding of their ideal customers. We start with a blank canvass and devise bespoke digital strategies to fuel each client’s business growth by engaging their target market effectively and delivering genuine sales leads that are easily quantiable.Who are your main customers Our customers operate across a wide range of sectors. We are currently working with clients across the UK and Ireland, US, France and Spain. Do you have a target in mind in terms of where you want the business to grow We are currently focusing the bulk of our efforts on the island of Ireland with a particular focus on Dublin and Belfast. What challenges have you faced The somewhat ‘snake-oil industry’ reputation of digital marketing sometimes poses a barrier to speaking with decision makers who in the past have invested with little . However, once we’re given an opportunity, we like to let the results do the talking. Who most inspires you Those who thrive in the face of adversity and have strong growth mind-sets. The type of person with the right measure of accountability, skill and relentlessness to inspire their teams to achieve targets. It’s a mind-set akin to that of a top athlete whose body is screaming ‘slow down’ in the business end of a race but whose mind interprets that as a cue to go faster. My we Martina – a former operations manager with Lidl Ireland who co-founded and runs leading human resources consultancy, HR Team – has these qualities in abundance. She inspires me in everything I do.Where do you see yourself in the next few years I love living and working in the North West. Whatever people like to call Derry or Londonderry, it’s a very special place with a lot of talent and a big future in driving the cross-border regional economy. With our headquarters at Catalyst Inc and plans underway for satellite offices in Dublin and the UK, we want to ensure our agency plays a part in shaping that economic prosperity with the provision of more high-quality jobs for the area.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/js_1.jpg","title":"uncertainty interconnectors and the future of ni energy post brexit","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business With a potential ‘no deal’ around the corner on Brexit, what will that mean for the future of Northern Ireland’s energy policy – especially on renewables, the I-SEM all-island market and power generation  John Simpson takes a closer look On the last working day before Christmas , the System Operator for Northern Irelandpublished draft proposals of how the electricity systems and grids on this island may operate in -. Subject to confirmation by the all-island Single Electricity Market Committee, the auction for electricity generators to be awarded capacity contracts, on an all-island basis, has identied electricity capacityof , MW which will be in place for the year starting October ,  – , MW of that all-island total is attributed to Northern Ireland.This is a critical series of draft decisions which will reassure the large conventional generators about their contracts and will impose the discipline of revenue limits constrained by the capacity auction. The draft decisions also point to the expectations in terms of the capacity earmarked from renewable sources, from inter-connection with the Scottish grid and the capacity adjustments that may follow from demand-side adjustment contracts.SONI has not been as open and transparent as should have been possible. Readers must make the assumption that ties location to where capacity payments are identied in sterling and euro.The SONI statement lists  generator names ,  of which are identied as DSUswhich leaves  others. Eight are shown as part of the AES capacity in Ballylumford and Kilroot: four are small capacity generators, six each have capacity of over MW , and the last capacity source linked to Northern Ireland is the Moyle Interconnector.SONI does not present the capacity awards in a way that allows readers to identy the location of each successful unit.The Utility Regulator has agreed that the available Northern Ireland capacity should include  MW from the Moyle Interconnector which represents over % of locally available capacity. This is a judgement that might be queried. Is the interconnectora guaranteed source of capacity  If, at a time of peak demand in Northern Ireland, demand in the grid in GB had no spare capacity, presumably the capacity might not be available for supply to Northern Ireland. The regulator and SONI are well placed to judge the probability of this outcome and might argue that it is a minimal risk.There are some interesting features stemming from the assumptions made in setting the framework for the capacity auction. First, Northern Ireland has been treated as meriting some contract iations because of locational constraints. This is a reflection of the limited capacity of the electricity grid on the whole island to send electricity to the places where there is demand. Both the Dublin area and Northern Irelanddid not attract auction bids adequately to supply these area locational constraints. For Northern Ireland. the easy explanation lies in the absence of the long awaited north-south grid expansion from to the planned distribution hub in Co Tyrone.The capacity auction allowed for the acceptance of bids with prices which are higher than the main auction prices which would match supply and demand across the whole island. Because of the locational deficit, some Northern Ireland bids now show capacity payment prices above the all-Ireland ceiling of £, per MW which applies to most of the successful bids.In the quotation from AES for the two large fossil fuel burning units, the proposal is that they should attract payment prices of £, and £, per MW. At first sight this appears to allow a premium of nearly % on the payment price for each MW. This seems more than a marginal cost and points to the possible cost savingsthe proposed new north-south link had been operational.This answer for the older high capacity units at Kilroot is a further reflection of the doubt about the continued viability of these units. It will be remembered that a year ago, these same two units were deemed unsuccessful in the auction but, at a late stage when faced with a request for a derogation to be allowed to close these units, the initially agreed settlement was revised.A year ago, the first capacity auction under the rules of the newly instituted I-SEM, was accepted with a capacity supply of near to , MW for all of Northern Ireland. Now, in early , SONI has concluded that for security of supply Northern Ireland should contract for just under , MW. There is no obvious major uplt in demand in Northern Ireland so that, quietly, the suggestion is that the arithmetic in late  may now be thought to have been slightly too risky.The capacity auction is a fundamental building block of electricity supply policy for Northern Ireland. However, on its own, the allocation of capacity and the possible scope for investment in new generating capacity must also be seen in the context of increasing,market forces allow, the proportion of electricity supply that is supplied from renewable sources. The distribution of generating capacity is still dominated by fossil fuels. Northern Ireland’s capacity is nearly % from gas andcoal. However, the statistics showing the proportion of electricity supply from renewables points to average consumption from renewables of nearer to -%. Because of the iability in the contribution of wind based renewables, it would be hazardousgreater security dependence was allocated to renewables.In turn, the caveat about the possible role of renewables points to the possible value of further investment in energy storage for which no major scheme has been launched. If Kilroot power station survives for a further three to four years, then the experimental electricity storage capacity on that site may become an attractive asset.There are several continuing questions about Northern Ireland’s security of electricity supply. Will Kilroot be given further stays of execution after   Will the North South interconnector eventually be built  Will the proposed large natural gas burning power station be built in Belfast  Will the politically unpopular investment in anaerobic digestion plants be tackled  Will the Brexit settlement, or lack of it, damage the continued operation of the all-island single electricity market  But... it seems Kilroot has been given a temporary extension of its role in keeping the lights on.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
