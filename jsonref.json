All passengers arriving in the UK now have to take a pre-departure Covid test because of fears about the spread of the new variant, and must also take a PCR test after arriving. The letter urges the government to remove “all emergency testing for fully vaccinated passengers” at the formal review on 20 December. It also calls for “a package of bespoke economic support measures” to be provided immediately to help the sector through this crisis. The letter, signed by the bosses of British Airways, easyJet, Ryanair, Loganair, Virgin Atlantic and Jet2, the managing director of TUI UK \u0026amp Ireland, and the CEO of trade body Airlines UK, says: Back in the UK, pub chain JD Wetherspoon has flagged that uncertainty over Covid-19 and the government’s new restrictions will hit its sales. In a trading update, Wetherspoons says that it may be “loss-making or marginally profitable” in the first half of its financial year (which runs from late July to late January 2022). The company says the restrictions announced last week will hit the hospitality sector, making it hard to predict sales and profits, with some customers, especially older patrons, “understandably cautious”. Wetherspoons told the City: It’s the fourth recent intervention, as Reuters explains: Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, says: The Turkish lira has plunged to fresh record lows today, after ratings agency S\u0026ampP cut its outlook on Turkey late last week. The slide puts more pressure on Turkey’s central bank, which traders fear could cut interest rates again this week, despite the deepening currency crisis. It added that Turkey could be downgraded if the currency crisis continues: It has faced persistent prompting from president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan who insists high interest rates cause inflation (most economists argue they curb it).  The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey meets on Thursday, and could lower rates again -- despite the slump in the lira which will push up import costs. Meanwhile, Turkey’s treasury \u0026amp finance Minister Nureddin Nebati has told Haberturk newspaper that the country’s economy will “rapidly improve”, without the need to raise interest rates.As a result, it says, there are 300,000 more families in poverty than two years ago, putting them in greatest risk from the cost of living squeeze. And with incomes in London and the south-east rising six times faster than in red wall regions since Boris Johnson’s 2019 election victory, the government’s ‘levelling up’ agenda in doubt, it warns. While measures such as the furlough scheme protected the earnings of workers, there was less support on average, for the poorest, leading to more inequality.  Alfie Stirling, director of research and chief economist at NEF, explains: NEF have tweeted some of the key points: The Competition and Markets Authority says it is considering whether the deal would lead to a “substantial lessening of competition” within UK markets. It’s inviting comments from interested parties by 10th January (details here). Nuance, is known for its pioneering speech technology, and Microsoft plans to use its voice-recognition tools to improve its cloud-computing offerings to healthcare and business customers. The Nuance deal is Microsoft’s second-largest ever, after the $26bn purchase of LinkedIn. On Friday, Reuters reported that Microsoft was set to secure unconditional EU antitrust approval for the deal. It reports that asking prices have seen their usual “December dip”, down £2,234 to £340,167 on its index. That’s the biggest annual rise in wholesale prices since the survey began in 1962, and suggests consumers face paying more for German-built goods. Gas prices have been pushed up by the possibility of the US imposing economic sanctions on Russia, as the military buildup on its border with Ukraine continues. Electricity prices are also sharply higher again today, as colder weather drives up demand. Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, says: Sterling has dropped by half a cent to $1.3225, near last week’s one-year lows, as traders assess the risk of new restrictions, and the impact on the economy. Shafiq Shabir, head of electronic trading at Intertrader, says uncertainty over the pandemic will make it harder for the Bank of England to raise interest rates on Thursday. In a clear sign of the financial stress felt by many owner-run businesses as they head into a potentially difficult new year period, many also said they would be forced to raise prices -- which will fuel the wage squeeze. The poll of 442 businesses found many were struggling with repaying the debts they racked up to get them through the pandemic as well as grappling with other challenges from supply chain disruption to shortages of key staff such as drivers and chefs, and high energy costs.  These are the highest readings since the question was first asked back in the year 2000, and sharply higher than before Covid and Brexit. Factories have faced a surge in commodity costs, with some also raising wages to attract and retain staff. James Brougham, Senior Economist at Make UK, says these costs are being passed on: Here are the main findings from the Make UKBDO Q4 Manufacturing Outlook: Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. UK workers are facing their toughest Christmas wage squeeze in a decade, as wages fail to keep up with rising prices in the shops, trade unions warn today. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has warned that pay is lagging behind inflation, creating a cost of living storm. That means the largest fall in real wages since 2012 and the second worse since comparable records began 2000. Families are being hit by surging energy costs and rising food bills, while manufacturers have been passing on their increased costs to customers. And with the economy barely growing in October, firms may struggle to lift wages even as they scramble to attract workers. TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady is urging the government to intervene and work with unions to boost pay across the economy: European markets are set to open higher, as investors await monetary policy decisions from the US Federal Reserve (on Wednesday) and the Bank of England and the European Central Bank (Thursday).  The Bank of England must assess whether to raise interest rates to tackle inflation, or resist until it knows more about the Omicron variant. Sanjay Raja, chief UK economist for Deutsche Bank, predicts the BoE will raise borrowing costs - although other City voices predict no change. It’s a finely balanced, decision, though, he adds. Later today the Bank of England will release its assessment of the strength of the UK financial system, and the results of its annual stress tests on banks.  These are expected to show that banks have strong capital cushions, which could clear the way for more lending to support the economy through the pandemic. According to the Mail on Sunday, the BoE is also preparing to dilute the UK’s mortgage rules, loosening affordability restrictions to make it easier for borrowers to take out larger home loans. And millions of office workers could be working from their home offices, attics or kitchen tables again, as the government asks people in England to work remotely “if you can”.

Er, OK then, just me. But what a tie that is for Celtic, nothing better than a trip somewhere you’d likely never go otherwise, and watching your players freeze to boot. Rapid Wien v Spurs or VitesseAnd, no doubt, in numerous other ways too. There’s nothing like being at a Bob gig wondering what on earth is this, then about three minutes in realising it’s one of my all-time favourite tunes. Last time I had the honour of seeing him play Watchtower, he segued straight into London Calling. That could absolutely be the case. I suppose my reference point for this is Roy Keane, who needed until December to get going after hurting himself in September. He was 27 and not a pace merchant to begin with, but I’m sure treatment is better now than in 1997-98.It would prove once and for all that the world is run by Narrative. And fair enough re Durrant – of course, medical science is constantly improving, and there could well be other examples. But I don’t think it’s a stretch to wonder if Van Dijk is as good as before – he’s not looked it to me, but he’ll be closer now than he was in August. Ha! If we’re being honest, I’m a one meal a day man, so tend to eat much later, and am on school-run duty at 4.50, so we’re good in that aspect. But if we’re talking football parochialism, then I’m not dismayed that my team’s rivals might not get harder games, and my team might get an away somewhere they’ve not been numerous times lately. And, more generally, I think there’s a better draw out there than the one we were originally dealt, so let’s see.Ties to take place on 17 and 24 February"},{"url":null,"title":"from annuals to zeds your ultimate a z guide to christmas","story":"Where did Christmas jumpers come from? How did they become so wildly popular? Is there any end to them? Who knows and no.  Photograph: iStockAre we there yet? Are we there yet? Yes, yes we are. It is time for our occasional Christmas A to Z full of random trivia and the occasional money saving tip.Annuals: One of the most cheering sights of Christmas is the appearance of hardy annuals on book shelves, in supermarkets and under Christmas trees all over Ireland. We might live in a digital age but it is most heartening to see that our love of colourful books detailing the adventures of the stars of the Beano, the Dandy, Ana and Elsa, the lads from Fortnite and all the rest abides. But where did the notion come from? Well the world’s first annual appeared in 1823 and was called Forget Me Not – and we haven’t. It was aimed not at children but at ladies. The notion caught on almost instantly and by the end of that century, the Boys and Girls Own annuals were selling by the truckload. Comics, TV programmes and films now all come with a side order of annuals.Boxing Day: We don’t obviously have Boxing Day in Ireland and anyone who uses the phrase is rightly eyed with deep suspicion – but on the off chance you have ever wondered why they do have it across the Irish Sea then today is your day. It is has nothing to do with boxing for starters and not much to do with boxes either. It is called Boxing Day because the day after Christmas was the day the money and gifts left in church by the rich for the poor were dispersed. The presents were left in boxes so, it should, by rights be called unboxing day.Christ: Is December 25th really the day Mary’s boy child Jesus Christ was born? No. No it is not. The New Testament might not be as long or as dense as the Old Testament but it is still pretty long and pretty dense but at no point anywhere in the good book is the birthday of Christ mentioned. That is because he didn’t have one – or at least not one anyone knew about. In fact it was more than two hundred years after the events chronicled in the bible took place before anyone even suggested December 25th as a day of Christian significance and it wasn’t until 300 years or so after Christ died that the Day of the Nativity was declared to be in December. We were slow to the Christmas party in the part of the world and it wasn’t marked in Ireland until the eighth century. And why December? There are many schools of thought. It may have piggybacked on the Roman holiday Dies Solis Invicti Nati or the day of the Day of the Birth of the Unconquered Sun. Or maybe it was because the Spring equinox of March 21st was the day the world was created. Light was created on the fourth day – March 25th so nine months later is December 25th. What about the Winter solstice? Whatever about the reasons, we should be glad it’s happens when it happens because it breaks up a very long winter.Deck the halls: This ancient Welsh melody was given English words by a Scottish writer in the 1860s. Little did anyone involved in its complicated birth know it would lead to us all spending the GDP of a small country on illuminations that are brighter than the sun to show the world that we really love Christmas. Oh, and speaking of decorations – and because this is still the Pricewatch page – if you are looking at your decorations this week and thinking they could do with a refresh do nothing right now. Wait until December 27th when all your festive needs for 2022 will be selling for half nothing in all your favourite hardware shops. Yes you will feel ridiculous going to the till but you’ll be the one laughing next November.Eating: Boy do we do a lot of eating over Christmas. In fact, the average Irish adult will consume over 6,000 calories on Christmas Day alone between the fry, the selection box, the turkey, the ham, the stuffing, the goose-fat soaked potatoes, the buttery sprouts, the gravy and all the other trimmings. Then there is the biscuits and the mince pies (with cream) and the boozy plum pudding and the trifle and the cheese and the chocolates. Down a few glasses of wine, a couple of glasses of Baileys and maybe an Irish coffee and your calorie intake might top 10,000 before you are fit for the bed. That might explain why many people will put on around half a stone over the festive season. Sorry.Fir versus fake: We all know that buying a real tree is better for the environment than the fake plastic trees that come all the way from China right? Hmm. Or is it? Well the fake plastic tree is more energy intensive to produce than a real one and is not recyclable, so once you are done with it it might languish in landfill for eternity. Real trees can come from down the road and are easily replaced. We did however come across a report from 2019 in this newspaper which said that if a household reuses a plastic tree for five years, it’s carbon footprint will be smaller than a household that buys a real tree every year. So maybe if you have an artificial tree you should keep it for as long as you can. You’ll miss the scent of the pine needles mind you.Goose: While turkeys arrived in Ireland in the 17th Century it wasn’t until the early years of the last century that they started making a regular appearance at the Christmas dinner table. Before then it was all about the goose. And why was that? Generations past were very utilitarian and while cows, sheep and chickens all had a use year round in the form of wool, eggs and milk, the poor goose was a farm animal that had little year-round value.Holly:  The leaves stand for the crown of thorns Jesus wore while the red berries are the blood he spilled during the crucifixion. Last Christmas we suggested on this very page that it wasn’t the jolliest of symbols. We had no idea our throwaway comment would prompt a stern letter to the Editor that came all the way from Rome. “The joy of Christmas is not simply about the happy story of a baby’s birth, but is a response to God’s light and presence breaking into the most unpromising of circumstances,” Rev Bernard Healy wrote.He noted that Christ was born “excluded from the usual comforts of home, in a land occupied by a foreign power, and into a family that has been displaced by an inhumane bureaucracy.”Ice: There isn’t much of that at Christmas in Ireland and there is going to be even less of it in the future thanks to climate change.Jingle bells: Written by James Lord Pierpont, this song was originally performed in September 1857 by an unfortunately black-face minstrel in Boston under the title One Horse Open Sleigh. It was first recorded in the late 1880s and was on its merry way. Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters recorded a version which sold more than a million copies in the 1940s. It was the first song played in space and is the most famous Christmas song that has absolutely nothing at all to do with Christmas.Jumpers: Where did they come from? How did they become so wildly popular? Is there any end to them? Who knows. Who knows and no.Kris Kindle: Or is it Chris Kringle? Or Kris Kringle? Or Kris Kringel? Or even just plain old Secret Santa? It really depends on where you are in the world. In this part of the world we tend to go with Kris Kindle in Ireland. Whatever it is called, it came from an Austrian gift-giver called Christkind or Christ Child. It is a very economical way of exchanging presents and can be a lot of craic – as long as you don’t get the worst gift giver in your circle in which case it is a pain.Love: Never mind your jumpers or your presents or your food. Ultimately Christmas is about love and sure what’s not to love about that?\u0026nbspSadly, it is also about money. Few Irish households will have any change out of €1,000 by the time the bells ring out for Christmas Day and many households will have spent a lot more than that.Mistletoe: The celts reckoned it was symbol of fertility with white seeds which reminded them of semen. The ancient Greeks called it “oak sperm” while Loki – who fans of the Marvel universe might be specially familiar with – played an absolutely hilarious trick on a blind god called Hodur that saw Hodur kill his twin brother Badder with a mistletoe arrow. We’re sorry if all these thoughts cross you mind next time you are standing under the mistletoe with your beloved.Nog: What the hell is nog – or Eggnog to give it the full name which does not fit in with our A to Z – does anyone really drink it? Well, it is not wildly popular in this part of the world as you know but the Americans seem to love it. It is made of milk, cream, sugar, whipped egg whites and egg yolks with brandy or whiskey frequently added to it for a bit of kick – sometimes when the booze was added, it became known not entirely appetisingly, as Holiday Sludge. “A glass of holiday sludge, anyone?” Yum.\u0026nbspO Holy Night: The second song ever broadcast on AM radio. It happened on Christmas Eve 1906 and it was played by a Canadian inventor called Reginald Fessenden. He unwittingly may have started a Christmas Song tradition that is with us still and led ultimately to Christmas FM, a channel we absolutely love.Presents: There is no getting around the fact that presents are a pretty big deal when it comes to Christmas. In fact more than half of the money we spend over Christmas goes on the things. It’s nice that most of spending is on other people but why is it the case? You can blame or thank Charles Dickens. Over six weeks between October and December 1843 he wrote A Christmas Carol and changed Christmas forever. Without the book we might not say merry or happy Christmas and we might not exchange presents at all. We’d still get the presents from Santa mind you so it is not all down to Dickens.Queueing: While some winter sales start days before Christmas and others start online on Christmas day, queues still form outside department stores across Ireland on December 26th or 27th. For its many sins, Pricewatch has been in the queues – for work purposes – so is in a position to offer some advice. First, you don’t want to be first in the queue. You don’t want to arrive outside Brown Thomas at 5am on the morning of the big day and stand around on your on for 90 minutes before the next person arrives. Take if from us. There is rarely more than 50 people in any queue when the doors open so if you arrive 10 minutes before the opening time then you should be grand. Wear layers so you can strip off a little in the shops, know what you want and where it is in the shop before Christmas and then get in and get out with all your shopping done before 10am.Roasted chestnuts: A Christmas fantasy favourite but not one common throughout Ireland. You can find them in some supermarkets and fancy food shops but where you can not find them is in your local park. The Horse Chestnut is the type commonly found lying around there and they are inedible so don’t ever try it.Stockings: Would you like to know why we have Christmas stockings? You would? Brilliant. Well Santa Claus comes from the North Pole but there are echoes of him in St Nicholas, a wealthy bishop in the fourth century who used to slip presents to poor people in secret. He was inspired to do this after coming across a man with three daughters and no dowries. Good old St Nick dropped a bag of gold down the man’s chimney. They fell into a stocking which had been left to dry. And that is why you hang a stocking at Christmas.Turkey:  We have Edward VII to thank for turkey. At the turn of the last century a turkey cost a week’s wages so it was considered quite the treat and fit for a royal. More than 70 per cent of Irish homes will serve turkey this Christmas even though one in four people are afraid they will cook it wrong and it will make them sick. Things to remember when it comes to turkey – don’t wash it, use a meat thermometer to make sure it is cooked and when you are buying your turkey try not to buy a small one. It might cost less but it is a false economy. The bone structure of a 6.35kg turkey and a 3.2kg turkey is pretty much the same, so all the extra weight on the bigger bird is meat. And you’re tired of eating it over Christmas, stick the rest in the freezer. You’ll be glad of it come the middle of January.Universal:  Christmas is not this. In fact there are dozens of countries where they don’t even get to hear Chris Rea driving home for Christmas even once.Veganism: According to a recent release from safefood, 8 per cent of Irish Christmas dinners will not have any meat on them this year. While the percentage is small, it is still much higher than it would have been even a decade ago.Wrapping: Never mind the nativity or even the man in the North Pole, the greatest mystery of Christmas is how some people are born with the capacity to beautifully wrap gifts while others – and we’re talking about ourselves here – can end up putting presents under the tree that look like they have been wrapped by a blind reindeer with only a role of masking tape and a child’s craft scissors to work with. What’s the story there? Is wrapping a skill that is taught - and if so, where are the classes? Is it genetic? What’s going on?Xmas: A lot of people hate the abbreviation – and they are right too – but we are just delighted to have a meaningful x for a change.Yultide: For this we can thank the god Odin and the pagan Anglo-Saxon Modranicht who gave us Yule or Yultdide.Zeds: For many people this is what Christmas Day is all about once the stress of the presents and the dinner is done with."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"John Feehan\u0026rsquos book charts effort to protect Offaly habitat and inherent bioersityStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"donegal town dealing with mica if it was in dublin this would already be fixed","story":"Moville, on Donegal’s Inishowen peninsula, is among the worst affected areas in the country for mica and for the students in Moville Community College, the subject is rarely far from their minds.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster.

If we’re to help keep the country safe, problem-solving skills and teamwork are absolutely crucial.    “That’s why this year’s Christmas puzzles are aimed at young people.    “I want to show young people that thinking differently is a gift. It is only with the right mix of minds that they can solve seemingly impossible problems, just like we do at GCHQ.” The GCHQ Christmas card is traditionally sent to other spy agencies and partners across the world.This year the card sets a not-so-secret mission for young people through a set of puzzles which increase in difficulty, each aimed at a particular age group.To support greater take up of STEM subjects, particularly among young girls, GCHQ has partnered with the organisation Stemettes on several activities over recent years.  Supporting this year’s Christmas card challenge, CEO of Stemettes Dr Anne-Marie Imafidon, said: “No matter your age, STEM skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving are important skills to have.In my work across the Stemettes with partners like GCHQ, we want all kinds of people to have the chance to explore these skills, and for those that enjoy this type of challenge to get an opportunity to further themselves in these areas.  “GCHQ’s Christmas Challenge is a fun festive way to do this, and I’d encourage schools and those who work with children to explore this type of activity as another way to engage the next generation in some light-hearted STEM fun.”Solve the puzzles, which increase in difficulty.

Among those who had visits from family and friends, around one-quarter were limited to doorsteps, or held through windows.Four in 10 dementia sufferers who saw no one on Christmas Day had a phone call of less than 15 minutes as their only human contact. Of those who did see someone during the week of Christmas, nearly one-third only had a 15 minute visit from either a neighbour, a family member or a paid carer.For almost half of sufferers, the only visit they got during the week was to drop off a Christmas meal or present.The research found that after more than 18 months of restrictions, 60 per cent of people with dementia were now less likely to recognise family members.Two-thirds of family carers said they were now feeling anxious about this Christmas, with a quarter now having to cope with increased caring responsibilities due to an increase in their loved ones’ dementia symptoms.Kate Lee, the chief executive officer of the Alzheimer’s Society said: “For many this festive season, the magic of Christmas will be marred by families having to cope with an unmanageable and irreversible decline in their loved ones. As the nation looks to go bigger and better this year to compensate for a Christmas in lockdown, people with dementia need us like never before.“With your generous donations, we can make sure no-one must face Christmas alone and without adequate support.”Marlene Aveyard, 70, from Guiseley, who is living with dementia, said: “Last Christmas was the first year I didn’t see my daughter, Jenine, on Christmas Day – and she is 45. Christmas Day itself was horrible. I had no special food and I didn’t open any presents, I didn’t feel in the Christmas spirit at all. I’ve never felt so lonely or isolated, I just sat and cried.“I normally pull myself up when I’m feeling down, but I couldn’t. I’m still getting over what we went through and it was several months before I saw my daughter face-to-face again.”She said the help she got from the Alzheimer’s Society was a “lifesaver,” keeping her “on an even keel” when she felt at her worst.The charity saw a significant spike in demand for its services during the “lockdown Christmas”, with calls to its helpline more than doubling that week, from 2,097 in 2019 to 5,153 in 2020 .The charity’s website saw an 88 per cent upsurge in searches on its website, with over 1,500 visits on Christmas Day. One of the most discussed topics on its online community was around how to respond to loved ones in care homes asking if they’re coming home for Christmas, the charity said.The latest figures estimate that there are now around 900,000 people living with dementia in the UK, despite so many people with the condition having died over the last 18 months, accounting for over one in four deaths from coronavirus.On Sunday, December 12, The \u0027s editors and writers manned the phone lines for this year\u0027s Christmas Charity Appeal.

However, the Government is now under pressure to implement Plan C after daily Covid infections hit their highest level since January on Friday.A Health Department source said: “If you follow the science, we should really be doing Plan C now. The PM is gambling with the NHS to save his leadership.“But we all know the PM can’t let anything hit Christmas. That really did him damage last time round. To do it again would be killer.” Despite this Mr Johnson has refused to rule out a Christmas lockdown.

Political staff and officials would frequently drink after work until the early hours of the morning, and order takeaway food to Ms Coffey’s office at the Department for Work and Pensions- while hospitality and office parties were banned under Covid regulations. While most DWP staff worked from home throughout the pandemic, a “core team” of her private office staff - who have desks in a small area outside her office door - continued to work from the departmental HQ, close to Westminster Abbey. At one such occasion during last year’s festive season, Ms Coffey handed out Christmas presents to her team. It comes as Whitehall was in ‘outright panic’ that more details of lockdown-breaking parties would surface in the coming days. The Mirror has been told aposgatheringsapos in Ms Coffeyaposs office throughout the pandemic were an open secret, with one source saying even during lockdown, there were parties all the time. Bottles of wine and beer were routinely found between staff members’ salads and sandwiches in fridges at the department, to be drunk at the informal, late-night soirees. A DWP insider said: “There is a constant flow of booze in the office.”  While the parties were not ‘organised’, staff meetings would often “evolve” into drinking, which would carry on until the early hours of the morning. Before the pandemic, Ms Coffey was reportedly the host of notorious late night karaoke sessions in the Houses of Parliament, which would regularly take place in her Commons office. The DWP told the Sunday Mirror there was “no karaoke” at the gatherings during the pandemic, but did not deny that late night drinking and mingling took place. A DWP spokesperson said: Throughout the pandemic, DWP officials have followed government guidance while continuing to deliver vital services for millions of people. “Staff worked from home where possible but a core team working directly to the Secretary of State regularly worked from the office, in accordance with the COVID- rules as they evolved. “The team regularly worked late into the evening and on a number of occasions they ate takeaway food and drank some alcohol. No karaoke took place. On one occasion close to Christmas, the Secretary of State gave gts to her core team, as she does every year. Ms Coffey faced fury earlier this year after the Mirror published a video of her singing aposIaposve Had the Time of My Leapos at a karaoke party at Tory party conference, the day before slashing Universal Credit for thousands of struggling families.Last week, the Mirror revealed a Christmas Party with drinks and canapés had been held at the Department for Education while Tier  rules were in place.And today, it emerged that staff at the Treasury held a boozy celebration to mark Rishi Sunak ’s spending review in November .Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyThe TreasuryDepartment for Work and PensionsBoris JohnsonAlcoholPoliticsChristmas party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Zahawi could not guarantee that all schools will be open everywhere next term - but said he would do everything in my power to keep children in class.Ministers have repeatedly said that closing schools again would be a last resort after repeated lockdowns caused massive disruption to childrenaposs learning.Asked whether he could guarantee no schools would be shut, Mr Zahawi told the BBCaposs Andrew Marr Show: We are absolutely working to make sure that all schools are open, that theyaposre protected. I will do everything in my power. We are still learning about this iant.  We know that a booster works.

Last month, Mr Zahawi insisted that closing schools was absolutely the last possible option. But fears are mounting about the spread of the new Omicron iant, with reports of at least two outbreaks in schools.Mr Zahawi confirmed on Sunday that there are cases in hospital with Omicron and warned that tens of thousands of Brits could end up needing hospital treatment.The Education Secretary also failed to rule out extending the vaccine rollout to primary age children following reports health officials are gearing up to offer jabs to young kids. He said: There is no plan at the moment to vaccinate primary school children for the reason that the Joint Committee on Vaccinationis still looking at the evidence as to what level of protection it would offer.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agencyis expected to announce that jabs are safe for children, while the JCVI is examining whether to recommend vaccines for kids, according to the Sunday Times. The European Medicines Agency approved the Pfizer jab for  to -year-olds last month. The MHRA said: Pfizer has stated that they are applying to the MHRA for an extension to their Covid- vaccine authorisation that would allow use in five to -year-olds. Further details on the timing of this submission would be for Pfizer to provide. We are committed to providing safe, timely access to treatment for UK patients, and will continue to prioritise our Covid- evaluations. This includes any decision on use in under-s. Any such decision would be subject to our robust regulatory standards. In the meantime, we are looking at the data from other countries to ensure that when an application is received, we are making the best decision for children in the UK. It comes after a damning report by Ofsted found that nearly every child in England had fallen behind at school due to Covid. It warned that loneliness, boredom and misery had become endemic - and some children had developed physical and mental health problems due to the disruption. Chief Inspector Amanda Spielman said there were children who sadly are safer in school than out of it as she warned that further shutdowns risk more cases like Arthur Lanbinjo-Hughes. The six-year-old was abused and killed at home in Solihull last year.

Why  No one knows. Or, at least, no one is willing to say. For as far back as anyone can remember, a stream of out-of-touch, often privately educated, Education Secretaries, have signed off on the idea that teaching student’s th century literature, at Level , is just what students need to secure them a decent job in the workplace. Students who don’t pass their GCSEs are forced to repeat what they’ve already failed at. Forced to engage with books written in a language they will never use. Trying to explain to young students who already feel like they have failed, why Jane Eyre is so important to them, is borderline abuse. At a time when young people are turning away from books and literature at an alarming rate, no one in government seems bothered or interested in providing students with something a little more relatable. Last week I had to face one such group. The futility and unfairness of it struck me mid lesson. I had no argument as to why they should engage with Dracula.  Why reading Stoker would be of use, interest, or benefit to them unless they had an express desire to go into further education. Which the vast majority don’t. Starting off a lesson with the words, ‘Today we are going to be looking at Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde’ will mean within two minutes % of a GCSE class will have shut down. Do the powers that be think there is no other literature available to young people  Using contemporary texts by authors like Kit de Waal or Lisa McInerny, would at least give students and teachers a fighting chance. If educators were permitted to teach English using contemporary literature that told of the lives and challenges of iniduals who looked and sounded like the students they were teaching, on subjects like county lines, gangs and drugs, or any other aspect of st century teenage le, more students would engage. It’s what they are familiar with. What takes up much of their time. And using a language they use themselves exploring issues and situations they can identy with. A large section of the materials we currently use to teach our young students are entirely ineffective. In fact, they are worse than ineffective. Relying on these texts throws unnecessary, unhelpful barriers in the paths of students. It damages their already damaged faith in themselves and a system that is supposed to support, nurture, and encourage them. If you don’t believe me, ask them yourselves. @StephenTuffin is a lecturer in Swindon Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyEducationSchoolsPoliticsChristmas partyGCSEsRochester and Strood\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Addressing the nation last night, the Prime Minister said the country was facing an emergency in our battle with the new iant - and two jabs will not be enough to protect people. He warned that Omicron could rip through an un-boosted population, overwhelming the NHS and leading to very many deaths. Covid restrictions are also being ramped up after scientists discovered the new Omicron iant is much more transmissible and spreading rapidly across the UK.It comes after Boris Johnson announced last week that England would move to the Governmentaposs Plan B measures. Epidemiologists fear the iant could cause , deaths by April and that the NHS could be overwhelmed as Omicron looks set to overtake Delta as the dominant iant within days. UK Health Security Agencyadviser Dr Susan Hopkins warned of a looming wave of infections - and said more measures may be needed. She said: Itaposs inevitable that weaposre going to see a big wave of infections. What we are not yet clear on, and which is what we are basically making sure people go out and get their vaccination for, is how much that will affect hospitals.  So, what do the latest Covid curbs mean for you  Hereaposs the latest. Working from home People in England are being urged to work from home where possible from today. This is aimed at reducing contacts. The furlough scheme has not ed, however, as no businesses are being shut down at this stage. The advice is to work from home aposwhere you canapos. Face masks New rules brought into force last Friday mean that anyone aged  or over must wear a face mask to enter a wide range of indoor venues. These include places such as cinemas, casinos and bowling alleys. The full list:community centres , youth centres, members clubs and social clubs libraries and public reading rooms shops public transport polling stations and premises used for the counting of votes places of worship crematoria and burial ground chapels visitor attractions and entertainment venuespublic areas in hotels and hostels indoor areas of sports stadiumsPubs, bars and nightclubs are exempt. There is also an exemption for singing, which applies to, for example, congregations and choirs. Technically, a person could avoid wearing a face mask by singing, but the Government has warned protestors attempting to abuse this rule will be stoped. Daily testing for Covid contacts  From tomorrow, double-jabbed people who come into contact with an infected person will be told to take daily lateral flow tests for seven days instead of isolating. The new advice applies to all cases of Covid, regardless of whether it is the Omicron iant or other strains. Unvaccinated adults must continue to self-isolate for  daysthey are a contact of someone with Covid.This means strict rules forcing people identied as close contacts of Omicron cases to isolate for  days are being scrapped. Care homes From Wednesday, there will be a new restriction on care home visits. Care home residents will be asked to pick three people to visit and one essential care worker. Covid passports From Wednesday, England could be facing the introduction of mandatory covid passes proving your vaccination status to enter some venues, including nightclubs.So a punter could have proof of double jabbed status or, under the new pass rules, a text message or email from the NHS showing a lateral flow result to get into a venue.Firms failing to check Covid passes properly may be fined £, and up to £, for repeat offences.But Boris Johnson is facing a major backlash to the plan as Tory backbenchers look set to vote against the plan. The PM may get the changes though parliament with Labour support but given he is under major pressure over the Christmas parties plan, the rules could be watered down.  So far, there are no limits on travel, household mixing and meeting groups of people. Downing Street has also rejected calls to put new restrictions on hospitality venues, so your Christmas party can still go ahead. What about a aposPlan Capos  Officially, there is no Plan C. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said on Friday there were no plans to go beyond what weaposve set out already.But Omicron could change things, and Health Secretary Sajid Javid is under pressure to bring in more stringent measures before Christmas.Further measures could include hospitality check-ins, tougher isolation rules, face masks in all indoor venues and further vaccine passport rules.

That’s why I’m asking Mirror readers to get yourselves boosted as soon as you can – andyou haven’t had your first or second jab yet, it’s not too late to do that either! Three doses provide much better protection for you and the people around you against this new iant. Getting Britain boosted will help us protect the NHS as they approach their winter peak and it will also help us to minimise the disruption caused to people’s lives, livelihoods and liberties as a result of restrictions.  We need to pull out all the stops on this. The next few weeks are crucialwe are to get Britain boosted before the Omicron wave hits its peak. That’s why we support the Government’s ambition to get every adult vaccinated by the end of this month. We’ve asked them to put a rocket under the booster rollout and they’ve listened. It’s a big ambition. Vaccination on this scale has never been achieved before. But the NHS will be moving heaven and earth to pull it off and they’ll have Labour’s full support. Let’s make sure they know we’re all behind them. All of us have a part to play. The vaccine is safe and effective. I’ve had my first two jabs and I’ll be getting my booster this week.

Arfan Ullah, , shared a keypad code he had kept after being dismissed, enabling the thieves to sneak into the store and loot passengeraposs luggage which had been lost during transit, Birmingham Live reports. As part of the overnight robbery at Manchester Airport, the gang even posed as holidaymakers, to make it appear they were the legitimate owners of the suitcases and bags they were stealing. They booked a taxi to and from the airport to aid their getaways in plain sight, with the cab drivers unaware the luggage they were packing into the boot and back of their vehicles were stolen. In two raids, three hours apart, the gang used the same suitcases they had stolen earlier to load up more items from the store. They later met at a rendezvous point to split the goods. Staff at Excess Baggage Group Ltd - which had fired Ullah the previous month - only discovered the thefts when they clocked in for duty the next day. They played back CCTV to see a total of five men pilfering the unit. It is thought a total of  people were involved in pulling off the raid. Ullah, who had gambling issues, was arrested along with two other suspects, after one of the taxi drivers was traced by police. Officials at the lost property office based at Terminal One were unable to quanty the value of the items missing. It emerged members of the group had attended the unit two weeks before the overnight raid. At Minshull Street Crown Court, Ullah, now a university student of Chorlton-cum-Hardy, Manchester, and warehouse worker Nikash Sultan, , of Birmingham, admitted burglary and were freed with  month community orders. Both were ordered to pay £ each, in compensation towards the missing luggage. Ateeb Qaiser, , of Manchester, did not attend the hearing due to testing positive for Covid and will instead be sentenced on December  - he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit a burglary at an earlier hearing. The raid occurred on March , , just four weeks after Ullah was let go by the lost property company. Prosecutor Miss Helena Williams said: Mr Ullah was in his probationary period and his performance was not satisfactory. Excess Baggage Group company, at Manchester Airport, collects lost property at the terminals and any items not claimed are moved to longer term storage overnight. The entrance for the burglary was at the car park located in terminal one. The door is unmarked and assessed by using a keypad lock. It seems Mr Ullah was given the keypad access code on February  - the day before he was let go. On the night of the incident itself, the last member of staff left at .pm and the premises were locked and secured. But a staff member the following day noticed a number of items had been disturbed. CCTV footage was recovered during that evening which showed there were two entries, the first at .pm and the second at .am in the early hours of the following morning. It can be seen on the first entry that two males entered the room and obtained access by using the code. They then left with luggage items and ed to a taxi. At .am three males ed to the room with the same suitcases they had took the night before. The taxi was traced and the driver admitted to taking three males to the airport. Two males left the taxi but a third male remained inside the taxi. He thought nothing of it. From the CCTV footage, it would seem Ateeb Qaiser was present during both entries. The first time he entered the premises with both males, but the other two males were not these two other defendants. He then acts as the lookout on the second occasion but it is not clearhe is with these two other males. Sultan was at the airport with Qaiser - they are seen getting out of a taxi and using an ATM. Mr Ullah was not present on either occasion, but he played a role in planning the incident and provided the door codes. There were a huge number of items missing however, there are no accurate figures placed on the items taken by these defendants. Enquiries show one mobile phone was in regular contact with another phone and Mr Ullahaposs phone had regular contact with aposNickapos which was Mr Sultanaposs phone. Mr Qaiser and Mr Ullah sent seven tests and  calls. They were in frequent contact. There is evidence that they met up in Oldham the next day. Inquiries showed on February , they went to the unit which shows there was some degree of planning. Mr Ullah and Mr Qaiser did not answer any questions in the interview. Mr Sultan confirmed he was known as aposNickapos but largely did not answer any questions. We cannot place any figure on the items lost. In mitigation for Ullah, defence counsel Hunter Gray said: He is deeply ashamed of his actions. He was immature at the time and has issues with gambling and misusing alcohol. He has not tried to excuse his behaviour and has taken steps to address his behaviour. He is currently studying at university and has ambitions for the future. He has been interviewed for a job as a hotel receptionist and is hopeful of getting that job. He is at a low risk of reoffending. This will be the first and the last time he is before the court. For Sultan, David Morton said: He was only present on the second occasion of these two trips. He is now working in a Sainsburyaposs warehouse but he needs to find his future and establish a trust with his colleagues. Finances are extremely tight for him. Sentencing Judge Tina Landale said: This burglary was planned and was extensive and there were up to  people involved. Vehicles and taxis were used to get away. Ullah, you had a signicant and crucial role. You used your knowledge of working there, which was a gross breach of trust. You provided the key codes to the premises and a high value of goods were stolen and these were targeted. It has not been possible to know the value or the quantity, but a large number of items were taken. It was clear you had been involved in communication in planning with Qaiser in advance of the burglary. In addition to the compensation fee, Ullah was also ordered to complete  hours unpaid work. Sultan must undertake  hours unpaid work.

If an unknown guest or unusual activity triggered the system, a security alert would then be ­automatically sent to the owner’s phone. A monitoring centre would also be alerted to a potential breach and could then call ­security guards or the police. According to the Sunday Times, the system can check records with other doorbells.  Amazon’s patent application, System and method for visitor detection algorithm, was given approval in the US in October. Charity Privacy International, which fights technology abuse, called it “worrying”. Ring said it did not use facial ­recognition in devices and the features in the patent were not “in development or in use”.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Amazon\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Government Communications Headquarters have officially unveiled their  Christmas card from their director, Sir Jeremy Fleming, and much like previous cards, there is another festive brainteaser to crack hidden within the card. However, this year there’s a twist – as the seven puzzles have been specially designed for  to -year-olds to try. Sir Jeremy’s cards are traditionally sent to National Security colleagues and partners across the world who work alongside GCHQ every day to counter organised crime gangs, terror groups and hostile states looking to do the UK harm. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.But you can download the festive card at the GCHQ website and take on the GCHQ Christmas Challenge yourself – and see how your brainpower ranks against your family members.Sir Jeremy said: “From Enigma to modern day encryption, GCHQaposs history is full of talented people tackling the country’s most complex challenges. If we’re to help keep the country safe, problem-solving skills and teamwork are absolutely crucial. “That’s why this year’s Christmas puzzles are aimed at young people. I am keen to encourage STEM skills, thinking dferently, and help foster the next generation of talent. “I want to show young people that thinking dferently is a gt, and it is only with a mix of minds that they can solve seemingly impossible problems, just like we do at GCHQ.” To support greater take up of STEMsubjects, particularly among young girls, GCHQ has partnered with the organisation Stemettes on several activities over the last few years. And CEO of Stemettes, Dr Anne-Marie Imafidon, is eager to see young girls try and tackle GCHQ’s Christmas Challenge. She said: “No matter your age, STEM skills, critical thinking, and problem-solving are important skills to have. In my work across the Stemettes with partners like GCHQ, we want all kinds of people to have the chance to explore these skills, and for those that enjoy this type of challenge to get an opportunity to further themselves in these areas. “GCHQ’s Christmas Challenge is a fun festive way to do this, and I’d encourage schools and those who work with children to explore this type of activity as another way to engage the next generation in some light-hearted STEM fun.”You can download the GCHQ Christmas Challenge on the GCHQ website, and the solutions will be posted on their Twitter and Instagram channels.

Ewelina Mejka, , and her husband Przemek, from Rugby, bought a home together after they got married but didn’t have the funds to purchase a new build.They bought a ‘doer upper’ three-bedroom property for £, and renovated the entire house with minimal help from professional tradesmen, reports CoventryLive. Ewelina, who works as a carer, told CoventryLive: We decided after we got married that we wanted to buy a house, but we didnapost get enough mortgage to buy a house where nothing  needed to be done. So we started to look for a house to renovate and thataposs how it all started. I love the boho style and fortunately my husband does too. Przemek took time off work to help with the renovation and the couple worked tirelessly from morning until late evenings to get the job done. First, Ewelina and Przemek ripped off all the old wallpaper in the rooms and replaced the floors, bathroom and entire kitchen. However, they hired workers to fit new windows and doors, and to install a boiler. They managed to get a brand new Ikea kitchen set for free and assembled it themselves.  Ewelina purchased most of the materials from Facebook marketplace and scoured the internet for bargains, cutting their costs dramatically. Their entire home renovation cost £, - raising the value of their home to £,. With the help of friends and family, the couple managed to finish the renovation work in just six weeks.Speaking about the process, Ewelina, said: My husband took time off from work and we both sat there from morning until evening. We were helped a lot by family and friends, without them it would not have been possible to finish renovating the whole house in six weeks. The entire house was renovated from top to bottom.  She added: I knew from the start that I wanted to decorate the house in this style. There are natural colours and accessories throughout the house. Ewelina found all the materials on the internet to be cheap and of good quality. Most of the new furniture was sourced from Facebook Marketplace. They put together the kitchen they bought from Ikea to cut the assembly cost in half. It is certainly not an easy job and you need a lot of free time to do it yourself, but you can save a lot of money this way. Many things can be bought on the internet for half the price than in a shop, but you have to start looking earlier. Sometimes furniture from Facebook marketplace only needs to be sanded and painted to look like new.

Each year Steve Kimberley speaks about the traumatic experience of losing son Matthew, , and daughter Lucy, , in a bid to discourage drink driving at Christmas.The youngsters died after a Range Rover driven by a drunk man careered into them as they drove home from a football match in Plymouth.Family friend Ben Jewell, , also died as a result of the collision, along with the driver of the Range Rover who was killed on impact, reports Cornwall Live. Steve, from Falmouth, said: My kids would still be here and I would have grandkidsthe man who drove into them did not drink that fateful day.As part of a campaign with Devon and Cornwall Police, Mr Kimberley has recalled the horric details as he speaks of the sobering moment he saw his two young children in coffins. Steve, who was left badly injured and confined to a wheelchair after the crash, wants people to know that drink driving is “not OK” and can have horrendous consequences. Ahead of the Christmas party season, which traditionally sees a spike in drink driving incidents, Steve has recorded an emotional video for the Vision Zero South West Road Safety partnership recounting the crash, of which this year is the th anniversary. Recalling what happened, Steve said: “It was the th of July, . I’d taken Matthew and Lucy, along with my good friend Ben Jewell, for a treat at the end of the school year to see Cha vs Plymouth Argyle in a pre-season friendly. It was a big occasion. “After the game we headed back to the car and started our journey home. We got out of Plymouth and got down to Notter Bridge and as we came around the bend to the left and were hit at high speed by a drink driver who was driving a Range Rover. “It hit us with such speed his car left the ground and landed the other way on the road. I remember the impact and at first there was this silence which is probably only seconds, but seems to go on for a long time while you’re trying to assess what’s happened to you. “After those few seconds all hell broke loose - the sound of metal, breaking glass and hissing and the smell of diesel. It must have been awful for those who saw it and the emergency services who attended. “It was carnage, absolute carnage. The driver hit us so hard that when the police arrived they couldn’t identy what type of car we had been driving.  “Ben was sitting in the front and hit the dashboard and was critically injured. Lucy was sitting behind me and was conscious at first. Matthew didn’t fare so well.” Paramedics were soon on the scene and extracted Matthew from the car first. Steve said: “They did CPR on the roadside, but it was too late for Matthew. They got Lucy out and took her to the ambulance, but all the time I couldn’t see any of this as I was trapped and unable to turn around. “A coach driver called Gary, who had been driving a load of Argyle fans home, got out and was with me and kept talking to me saying ‘stay with us buddy, don’t go to sleep’. “They had to cut me and Ben out of the car. They wrapped me in something like a lead blanket to protect me from the broken glass and metal. It took a long time and there was so much going on.” Steve was transported to Derrord Hospital with a broken collar bone, damage to his sternum and severe leg and hand injuries. He remembers being in intensive care when the news was broken to him about Matthew and Lucy. He said: “I honestly can’t remember who it was who told me – it might have been a doctor, but it might have been my we or my father-in-law. They just said ‘the kids are gone’. “I thought it was a bad dream. I knew they were hurt but I had this feeling that they were going to be alright. I remember saying to someone ‘this isn’t fair, how is this fair ’.  “It just didn’t seem real, it felt like I was in someone ’s body. He continued: The following week Ben’s parents had to take the decision to switch his le support machine off. I can’t imagine what that must have been like for them. He was their only son.” Steve remembers visiting his children in a wheelchair at the chapel of rest at the hospital. He said: “There’s something very sobering about seeing your children, covered in a white sheet, both in coffins. I remember thinking ‘that’s them, but it’s not them’ because you expect them to just run through the door. “That was the last time I saw my children. Nobody wants to outlive their kids. I’d have willingly given my own le to save one, two or all three of those smashing young people who had their whole lives ahead of them, but unfortunately you’re not given that opportunity. They were taken away from us, and it’s not fair.“Going to both your childrens’ funerals at the same time in your local church is something you should never had to do. Following a hearse to the crematorium in Truro with your kids in coffins ahead of you, seeing that curtain go across and knowing you are never going to see them again – I want people to know that it is not okay to drink and drive.“If that driver hadn’t drunk any alcohol, my kids would still be here – I’d have grandkids. My youngest son would be an uncle. Matthew and Lucy would be coming round to us for Christmas and I’d be bouncing grandchildren on my knee – but that hasn’t happened.” On the anniversary on the collision, Steve takes to Facebook to post pictures of Matthew and Lucy and tell their story, with the hope of preventing anyone who might be thinking about driving while under the influence of drink or drugs.He said: “I know there are people out there who have seen my posts on Facebook and said they think very carefully about what they do now. I will continue to do those posts until the day I die because people need to know it is not okay. “It’s quite simple -you know you’re going out for a night, you can do a number of things. You could have a designated driver who you provide with free coffees and soft drinks for the night. If you can afford to drink, you can afford a taxi or an Uber or a minicab. “If you’re not too bad, you can walk home safely. Or just don’t drink, because not having a drink won’t kill you.” Steve also believes friends, bystanders and landlords have a major role to play in preventing incidents of drink driving. He said: “If you’re in a group of people and someone is drinking and you know they are thinking of driving, you have a responsibility to do one of several things. Take their keys away, walk them home, call them a cab. “Never get in a car with a driveryou know they’ve been drinking, you are putting yourself in danger.

Footage shows the steady-handed expert save the three-month old Jetta, a German Shepherd, after she guzzled the stone while playing in her owner’s garden.The poochaposs owner noticed the pup was struggling to breathe and rushed her to the vets, Coventry Live reports. Staff at Avonvale Veterinary Centre, Stratford-upon-Avon, took an X-ray which showed the pebble was stuck in her windpipe. Vets made several attempts to remove the slippery rock unsuccessfully and clinical director Simon Davies dashed to help from an animal hospital in Warwick. The footage shows Mr Davies using a videoscope to locate the pebble before carefully removing it from the pupaposs airway. Vet Sarah Ives told CoventryLive: “Jetta arrived in a collapsed state and was gasping for breath.“We straight away provided oxygen therapy and tried to ascertain what was causing the obstruction. “As we couldnapost see anything obvious, we decided to intubateand examine her under general anaesthetic. “Jetta’s colour immediately improved and she was stable enough for us to take an X-ray. “We very quickly found the problem. There was a stone wedged in her bronchibut fortunately it had only blocked one side of her airways, so she was still able to pass some air. “It remained a serious situation, though, so we called our clinical director Simon Davies, who came over from our Warwick animal hospital to help deal with the case. “He arrived with a videoscope which he passed down Jetta’s throat to locate the stone and carefully retrieve it. “It was quite a dficult procedure, as the stone was very smooth and kept sliding away from the instrument he was using to try and secure it. “We all let out a cheer and breathed a sigh of relief when he did manage to grasp the stone and carefully pull it up and out of Jetta’s airway. “Jetta improved quickly. She was put on a course on antibiotics and was allowed back home to her grateful family that evening. “She’s one very lucky girl as it was the team’s quick thinking and actions which very much saved Jettaaposs le.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsTherapyDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Footage of the shocking incident captured by Patricia’s neighbour’s doorbell camera and shared online showed McCafferty standing over Patricia as she let out a moan, before saying something to the postie.  But in response, McCafferty said “I canapost help you pal” and proceeded to explain that he was apostoo knackeredapos to assist the pensioner after her fall. He then left the stricken OAP without even calling for help. Thankfully, -year-old Hermes driver Karolina Domska found Mrs Stewart crying in the snow  minutes after the fall and helped her back into her house.  Mrs Stewartaposs family fear she could have died in the freezing conditions, with the pensioner - who walks with a Zimmer frame - suffering from bone disease osteoporosis. Niece Sheryl Harkins said: What this gentleman did is disgusting. He deserves everything he is going to get. He shouldnapost be working with the public. Grandmother-of-two Patricia, who lives alone, said she felt dizzy and fell from the top step, banging her head.  With the postman ignoring her pleas for help, she said she feared she might have been lying there for hours.At the timePatricia told The Sun: Twenty minutes I was shouting aposhelpapos and I was crying.I was lying partly in the snow and I banged my head. She added: Evenhe was knackered, at the end of the day thataposs his job. The gran said she was left with a lump the size of an egg on her head following the incident. Ms Harkins previously said she was still awaiting an apology from the postman.An investigation was launched by the Royal Mail and McCafferty was initiallysuspended , while an area manager later visited Ms Stewart to apologise in person and bring her chocolates. At the time, the company said it expects the highest standards of behaviour from employees. We regularly remind our postmen and postwomen of the important role they play in their local communities,” a company spokesperson added. We have been in touch with the customer concerned to apologise and to inform them we are investigating this incident.” “We are sorry for the distress this incident has caused.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Royal Mail Ltd.SnowPensioner\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Charlotte McCarthy spent the festive season in  in a major trauma unit after being involved in a horric crash alongside her partner, Jak Metcalfe, and her parents.They had been celebrating Charlotteaposs graduation when the couple suffered le-changing injuries when their car was hit by a truck. Firefighters had to cut the family from the wreckage and doctors told herthere was one more millimetre of damage to an artery she would have died, reports LancsLive. Jak managed to escape the wreckage and bravely tried to save his partner but collapsed with pelvic injuries. He was given a   chance of survival. Her parents, Suzanne and Tony, were also left with major trauma. But three years on the couple are celebrating with the birth of a miracle baby.The news of the pregnancy came as a surprise to Charlotte who thought the couple may never be able to have kids because of their injuries. But on December , the beaming new mum and dad welcomed little Cara Anne Metcalfe into the world. We always worried that we might not be able to have babies because of our injuries and she is a miracle. And it’s a miracle that she’s so healthy,” said Charlotte.The couple once again thanked the heroic NHS workers with  surgeons helping to deliver Cara.It was decided that a caesarian section under general anaesthetic was the safest delivery method. Charlotte was also unable to have an epidural due to having a metal plate in her spine. Charlotte said: “When I first got pregnant, it was a bit of shock. We were speaking to the colorectal nurse because we thought I had a bowel blockage. They said it’s not a blockage but there is something there! “We discovered I was pregnant and had to have all these conversations with consultants to check they were happy for it to go ahead and amazingly they were.”  Considered high risk, the couple went for frequent scans and checks during the pregancy before the section took place at  weeks. “It was a shame that I didn’t get to meet the baby straight away but Jak was there all the time,” she said. Jak added: “It all went quite smoothly really, or as they planned it to at least. There were  people in the surgery.” Due to jaundice and weight loss, Cara visited hospital most days in the week after coming home and the family are again grateful for all the support and care they have received. They mentioned Paul Barrow, the consultant colorectal surgeon who supported them right through to the birth, among a long list of doctors, nurses and carers they want to thank. Now back home with a healthy Cara, Charlotte said: “It’s tiring but it’s just so lovely because when we look at where we were three years ago, it’s totally dferent now because she’s here.  The couple got engaged two months after the crash, but Covid had pushed back their original wedding date. The couple plan to get married in July . The truck driver involved in the crash had  points on his licence was not permitted to drive such a vehicle. At court, he admitted careless driving and was fined £,. Amazingly, the victims met up with him before his sentencing and shook his hand after he apologised and expressed his remorse. Speaking in , Charlotte said: “This wasn’t about forgiveness or for us to get angry. “We talked about our injuries, he had tears in his eyes. There were five of us in that crash  months ago, him included. “I shook his hand because after all of the above and facing court I have run out of strength and need some peace.

Known only as Megan, the member of staff claims to have worked at Primark for nearly six years, starting her job there in .The -year-old from Chelmsford said sheaposs currently employed as a retail assistant and works as part of the delivery team, helping to put new stock out on the shelves.Speaking to Fabulous, she revealed that shoppers donapost realise how fast stock actually sells out, saying that some of the items she puts out can be snapped up within minutes during the festive season. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. She told the publication that the storeaposs busiest shopping times are usually between am and pm - so youaposll probably want to avoid this period when youaposre out Christmas shopping. Instead she believes the best time to get your hands on a must-have item is at Primarkaposs opening time on a weekday. Megan explained: In our store, we have deliveries Monday to Saturday so there is new stock nearly everyday. On Sundays, employees fill from the stock room so the shop floor is always stocked.  We get a delivery at am which is worked as soon as it comes off the lorry so the best time to come in would be as soon as the shop opens as that’s when the newest, latest stuff will be out in the full size range, she continued. Another useful tip from Megan is to avoid shopping at the weekendsyou can. My top tip is to go in early and avoid weekends, Saturdays especially. Alsoyouaposre in need of something, ask a staff member and they will advise you with what you want or show you where something is. She adds thatyou are going to shop during the busy times, remember many staff are working extra hours over Christmas and itaposs hard for them too.  When it comes to the Boxing Day sales, the same advice applies - shop early to avoid being disappointed.In terms of bargains, Megan says there will be reductions all over the store, but itaposs the ladieswear section where youaposll find the biggest price cuts. The employee added that this is the time to go to find something you missed out on when shopping previously, as they have more designated stock come in especially for the hectic Boxing Day Sales.Do you have a Primark story to share  We want to hear all about it.

A man wearing a black riding helmet and carrying a whip was seen picking up rescue cat Mini and looking over his shoulder before tossing its body into a garden in Maldon, Cornwall. He arrived as a pack of eight hunting hounds were caught on video savaging the -year-old black tabby cat who belonged to resident Carly Jose, . Furious onlookers shouted after him b*****d and come here as he fled the rural housing estate following the incident in March. One woman can be heard yelling: What the hell have they done  Theyaposve got one of our cats. A male resident said: He threw it over my garden.  The hunter, dressed in a red hoodie, dark jeans and khaki wellies, was seen carrying what appeared to be a horsewhip in his left hand as left the area. Distressed residents called out from their homes as he began running towards a country footpath. Charlie Knight, who filmed the incident, chased the man onto a single-track road warning him that the incident was caught on video.  The man replied: Iaposm coming back in a minute mate. Iaposm just going to sort the hounds out and Iaposll be back. Leader of the hunt John Sampson, who owns a Cornish farm, was last week sentenced for being in charge of dogs that were dangerously out of control and fined £,. Ms Jose spoke of her joy and said it was a huge victory against the hunts. The court heard Sampson was exercising  hunting hounds at the time near the village before six or seven dogs fled into the housing estate where the incident happened. A petition titled Miniaposs law is now calling for the government to protect animals and the public from hunting activities such as trail hunts and hunting hound exercises.Ministers will debate the issue in Parliament after the petition gained more than , signatures. Responding to the petition, a government spokesperson said: The police can take action under the Dogs Act  where dogs are out of control and dangerous to other animals. This Government will not amend the Hunting Act.

Jenny Turnross, director of practice at Birmingham Childrenaposs Trust, confirmed shocking reports that social workers had been physically and verbally abused as a direct result of the harrowing case.It comes after a passionate plea from the trustaposs chief executive not to demonise staff following the murder of the six-year-old, reports Birmingham Live. Once the pair were jailed, the case prompted a national outpouring of grief and ministers vowed to take action.The Government announced an inquiry into how social services and local authorities liaise and Boris Johnson urged a so-called Arthuraposs Law so child killers die in prison.The leader of Solihull Council has also ordered an independent verication of the local authorityaposs involvement in Arthuraposs le. The case happened under the jurisdiction of Solihull Childrenaposs Safeguarding Partnership but its ripple effect has extended into Birmingham and beyond. Andy Couldrick, the chief executive of Birmingham Childrenaposs Trust, previously made a passionate plea to heartbroken Brummies not to direct their anger at social workers. But his colleague, Jenny Turnross, has now revealed their worst fears have come true. During one shocking encounter, it is alleged a social worker was spat at in the street. There have been reported incidents of social workers being called names and assaulted in the street, Ms Turnross told BirminghamLive. I can confirm that. Askeda direct connection could be made between the Arthur case and these alleged incidents, she said: Yes it can because those are the conversations that are taking place in our communities at the moment. Everybody is very distressed and saddened by whataposs happened to Arthur so yes we can make that connection. Only today , our lead member for childrenaposs staff has spoken to staff about having zero tolerance to our staff being harmed and threatened. Itaposs a very dficult climate that we work in.  Ms Turnross urged people to support social workers. She said people in the media and Government could talk to communities and help them understand how the vast majority of children in the city are safe. She went on: People see these beautul pictures of Arthur and think aposhow can professionals and organisations allow something like to happen to this childapos. But what they donapost see is the thousands of children we support and keep safe. They donapost see that because, unfortunately, the good news doesnapost really travel. Itaposs really such a shame, the public doesnapost understand that social workers do not have the power to remove children. Our job is to go and investigate and write up our findings. If we are concerned, we put that information to the court or to the police.  We are the face of it but we are sat in a multi-agency arrangement. Ms Turncross added that social workers in Birmingham and across the county were facing a very challenging landscape. She oversees  social workers in the trust and said she was communicating with them every day by asking them to be aware of the anger and upset in communities. We will be the target of some of that anger, she went on. And thataposs something that sadly, in this society, we have to be prepared for.

The Met Office has issued two yellow weather warnings for wind as a raging storm is expected to descend on the far north of the UK.The first warning - to the north east - is in place until pm on Monday while the second alert covering the west of Scotland, is in force until am. In those warnings experts say that aposinjuries and danger to le from flying debris are possibleapos as heavy winds batter the north of the country. Forecasters said: Very windy weather is possible across northern parts of Scotland. There is a risk of disruption to travel, particularly ferry services.  The Met Office added that people in the affected regions should expect damage to buildings, road and bridge closures and power cuts. There could also be impacts on road, air and ferry travel as well as large waves seen on coastlines. Meteorologists added: There is potential for wind gusts to reach  to  mph, and in excess of  mph in a few locations, particularly over the Western Isles.  The strongest gusts will be from a westerly or southwesterly direction. However, the very strongest winds may remain just offshore. It comes after parts of the north and Scotland were hit by Storm Arwen and Storm Barra in recent weeks. Elsewhere, across the country on Monday the Met Office has predicted rain to lash much of England and Wales, while the south will see the most sunshine during the day.  Temperatures are forecast to remain low with most places staying in single digits throughout the day. The south will see relatively warmer skies with highs just creeping over C along the south coast as well as across southern England and south Wales. UK Weather Forecast Today: Very windy at first for Shetland. Rain stalling across Wales, central and eastern England, becoming heavier for a time later today. Drier, mild and occasionally bright further south. Elsewhere, some sunshine but showers too, these mainly in the northwest. Tonight: Rain Wales and central England sinking southwards. Some fog to north with frost parts of northern England and east Scotland. Becoming windier Scotland with rain arriving in west later. Tuesday: Dry for most but fairly cloudy, best clear spells to lee of high ground and across central parts. Rain and strong winds in far north.

Here’s what the dferent alert levels mean and why it has gone upThe Covid alert system sets the levels of risk on the basis of how fast the virus spreads Image: Amer Ghazzal REX ShutterstockByMalvika Padin:,  Dec Updated:,  Dec | comments On Sunday, December , the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, along with NHS England director Professor Stephen Powis, announced their recommendation to raise the Covid alert levels from three to four. Though these alert levels have nothing to do with scale of restrictions imposed, it does describe the state of the coronavirus in the nation. The current level four alert indicates that the Omicron iant of the virus is spreading fast.There are five colour-coded Covid alert levels, which are set by the Joint Biosecurity Centre , a team set up in  who identy changes in infection rates using testing, environmental and workplace data. What is the level  UK Covid Alert and why has it been raised from level    Increasing the UK Covid alert from three to four means that the epidemic is “in general circulation, transmission is high and direct Covid- pressure on healthcare services is widespread and substantial or rising”, according to Government guidance. The statement from UK’s four chief medical officers and Professor Powis read: Transmission of Covid- is already high in the community, mainly still driven by Delta, but the emergence of Omicron adds additional and rapidly increasing risk to the public and healthcare services.  It also said that there has been early evidence of Omicron spreading faster than Delta and evading vaccine protection, adding that hospitalisations due to the iant are already occurring and “likely to increase rapidly. The last time that the UK Covid alert level was at four was between late February and May in .What do the dferent alert levels mean  The Covid alert system which was unveiled by the government in May  has five levels that assess the risk of the virus on the basis of Covid-’s reproductionrate. This measures how fast itaposs spreading. The five levels are :Level five – the red level, which signies a material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed Level four – the amber level, showing high or rising levels of transmission Level three – indicating that the virus is in general circulation Level two – showing the number of cases and transmission are low Level one – the green level, which means Covid- is no longer present in the UK The Covid alert level systems are completely separate and independent from government decisions to ease or tighten restrictions, so a rise in level doesn’t automatically mean any change in Covid rules, unless otherwise specied.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CoronavirusOmicron iantNHS\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Mr Wise called the restaurant in advance to ensure tips weren’t shared among all staff in order to make a real dference to just one or two people. The group picked Ryan - who was tearful when presented with the generous gt - to split with another waitress who served their table. But shortly after Ryan said the restaurant managers demanded the tip was shared among all of the restaurant staff - something that hadn’t been requested in the three and a half years she worked there. Do you think the waitress deserved to be fired  Have your say in the comments section  She told Fox : “I was told that I was going to be giving my cash over to my sht manager and I would be taking home  percent.” Ryan - who had studied Spanish at the University of Arkansas - had planned to pay off her student loan with the money. But the bosses’ orders would have cut her gt to approximately £,. During the evening, Mr Wise, who picked the restaurant because its his we’s favourite, recorded the big reveal. “I’m so sorry to interrupt everyoneaposs dinner, this will only take  seconds, he begins in the video.  “We have a table full of absolutely amazing people from all over the country who have traveled here, and tonight weaposre hosting a £ Dinner Club,” he tells Ryan, as he wraps his arm around her. “Everyone at this table has contributed or tipped £ for you and for the other waitress who unfortunately had to go home because sheaposs not feeling well. “And then we put it out to our social media channels, and then we actually had a bit more money sent in, so we are tipping a total of £, for you to split with the other girl who took care of us.apos  He adds that waiting staff suffered during Covid and it was a gesture that a friend of his came up with to help give back, he told  News. Sadly, a few days later Mr Wise discovered Ryan was been fired for ‘violating’ the restaurant’s rules by telling him about the company’s tip policy. Mr Wise said after he discovered Ryan had been forced to share the tip he ed to the restaurant to get his money back and to hand it over directly to Ryan. However the owner refused to communicate.Upon hearing Ryan was fired, Mr Wise took to social media in a bid to help her further. He wrote on Facebook : “I’m so saddened to hear that the girl we tipped the other night at our £ Dinner Club has been fired from her job. “I donapost fully understand why this would happen to what seems like such a sweet and kind-hearted woman. “Nonetheless, Iaposm committed to showing her that there are great people in the world that will do good when they can.”He then set up a GoFundMe page to raise funds for her, where he describes Ryan as a ‘very kind woman’ who was working two jobs during the pandemic to make ends meet. He wrote on the page: “She has incredible aspirations to grow her own business and I can tell has a servants-heart.“Le can be really tough but I hope we can all band together to make sure this wonderful woman knows there are still really good people out there that will help when they can.” So far the page has raised £,. Oven and Tap officials told Fox  they honoured the group’s request to give the cash to just two staff members. They said: “After dining, this large group of guests requested that their gratuity be given to two particular servers. We fully honoured their request. “Out of respect for our highly valued team members, we do not discuss the details surrounding the termination of an employee.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Employment rights\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Youaposd open each door to find a festive picture - there was no chocolate, beer, or makeup to procure. But considering all the misery and gloom of the last two years, many of us have indulged in a treat-based advent calendar. And who doesnapost love a little chocolate each morning  Especially when youaposre young and normally have strict limits on chocolate consumption. But one chocolate firm has apologised after leaving some children in floods of tears after they discovered there was no sweet treat behind a window. Parents who had bought their kids an advent calendar from Tony Chocolonely contacted the company - who confirmed they had left out a chocolate on purpose. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here The Fairtrade company left out  December as part of a bid to educate consumers about inequality in the chocolate industry. This was then followed up by two chocolates on  December - in a bid to highlight the imbalance. But it was hard for some children to understand, with one mum writing on the FB page: “My eight-year-old daughter was in floods of tears at the disappointment. She has ADHD and is awaiting a possible autism diagnosis, so what seems like small upsets to others are a big deal to her.”Another wrote on the firmaposs Facebook page: I think youaposre preaching to the wrong people here. Those that bought yourcalendar did so because they already support your cause.Causing upset to small children - who donapost actually buy their own chocolate, just to prove a point doesnapost sit well with me. A third added: My  year old was devastated there was no choc! Iaposm not sure heaposll appreciate your message eitherBut one mum commented: Totally got it straight away, I think it’s a perfect session for anyone. Great way to teach a child about fairness and equality - no giving in and opening another door in this house - the point would be lost and you learn nothing. Another added: It was a great way to highlight the situation, especially during a season when so many of us are surrounded by so much.apos In a statement, Tony’s Chocolonely said : “At Tony’s we use our products to communicate our mission – to make  percent slave free the norm in chocolate.“In Ghana and the Ivory Coast, at least . million children work under illegal conditions because the price being paid for cocoa is too low. Worst still, at least , adults and children are forced to work. We don’t think that’s okay. “So our products, including our countdown calendar, are purposefully designed to be unequally ided. Our countdown calendar includes  tiny Tony’s split over  windows. # has no tiny, # and # have two tinys to illustrate this. Following the backlash, the company said: “We have more to learn in considering how we can make our products as inclusive as possible “Unfortunately, we failed to consider the dficulties empty windows can cause for neuroergent children and adults. We have more to learn in considering how we can make our products as inclusive as possible. “We would like to welcome all feedback on how to make our products more accommodating for neuroergent people going forward as it was not our intention to cause this issue.

Whether theyaposre being denied their owneraposs fast food, are unhappy with the portion theyaposve been served up, or are convinced they deserve to be fed whenever they please, these dogs had some of the funniest over-the-top reactions to their dietary restrictions. A series of hilarious clips have been shared across the internet showing ious dog breeds voicing their displeasure at the lack of grub on offer. For some, a despairing look has done all the talking, as they display their best puppy dog eyes. Here are a few stories that have had people chuckling. “Where’s my scrambled egg  When Dusty was offered kibble with carrots and peas, the sassy dachshund was having none of it.Dusty quickly shoves the bowl away, while the hilarious TikTok clip from@dustydollysausagesguesses at what the fussy pup might be thinking.“Nope, get it away from me. I don’t want that brown ****,” the voiceover says. “I’ve seen what you’re having for tea and you offer me this  How dare you, it’s an insult.” In fairness to Dusty, she just recently gave birth to six puppies, so perhaps she feels deserving of something a bit fancier as a hard-working new mother. Dusty’s owner Chloe Booth says that it’s not unusual for the a dog to refuse her standard dog food in favour of scrambled eggs, boiled chicken or fish. “She thinks she’s Queen of the house,” Chloe says. Food dispenser tantrum  Olive’s owner has bought her a shiny new food dispenser - but the Dogo Argentino is convinced that the new gadget must be broken, because it won’t give her endless supplies of food on demand. Poor Olive clearly feels hard done by that the automatic dispenser has been set to a schedule that doesn’t suit her appetite, in a TikTok clip posted by@olive.and.haileythat left viewers in stitches over her melodramatic reaction.The pup barks, growls and whines at her owner, clearly arguing the case to fix the dispenser to give her food right away, as owner Hailey patiently explains that it will only feed her three times a day. But Olive won’t take no for an answer, having a full-on tantrum in front of the dastardly dispenser and wailing dramatically when Hailey says it will next give her some food at noon. “I will surely starve by noon, mother!” one TikTok user commented on the funny clip, which seems to sum up Olive’s argument exactly. Phil Collins, who   This Staffordshire Bull Terrier is hungry - and he wants the whole house to know about it. Alfie’s solution to alert everyone that it’s his dinnertime is to perform a ‘drum solo’ on the bottom of his empty bowl.In a TikTok clip that shows Alfie in “full on a mode”, the dramatic dog paws frantically at his bowl like he’s trying to dig for more food - or at least wake everyone in earshot, theDaily Star reports . “You hungry mate ” his amused owner asks in the@alfieandaryaTikTok clip, to which Alfie looks up pointedly ashe can’t believe the audacity of the question.Measly portions  Even though diets might be the best course of action sometimes, nobody enjoys being put on one - and Mango’s face says it all.The golden retriever was left fuming after being served up a measly portion of kibble, ina video posted on TikTokfrom @itsmissmango.Although she was put on a diet by her vet, that does little to appease Mango, who flashes her owner a desperate look when she realises that the small amount poured into her food bowl is all she’s getting. The short-changed pup gathered a lot of sympathy from viewers, with one person declaring: Mango - Iaposm coming to rescue you! McDonald’s obsession Of course, dogs often expect their owners to share their meals with them - and evenit’s not in their best interests to tuck into human food, it doesn’t stop them from wanting in on the action, as Gus proves in a TikTok clip by@margot_and_gus .The six-year-old Weimaraner is obsessed with McDonalds, and will do anything to get his paws on his mum’s cheeseburger. The vocal pup spends several minutes getting himself very worked up at the fact that the tempting treat isn’t being offered up to him, performing desperate spins and toe-taps around the kitchen as he cries.

He said he was completely taken aback, but then realised his eyes were playing tricks on him - and what he was seeing was his own reflection mirrored back to himself. What Thomas had seen, while climbing Great End in the Lake District, was a rare optical illusion known as a brocken spectre - where a large shadow of an observer is cast onto cloud or mist. What do you think about the optical illusion  Let us know in the comments...Thomas, from Manchester, said: I was taken aback a little bit. Itaposs really beautul. It looks like a figure floating into the sky, it looks quite spiritual. It was weird, surreal and a really beautul moment - I was looking down a gully from the summit, the sun was behind me and shining bright. It was a cloudy day so the clouds were moving in and out of the summit. I could see moisture particles in the air when I looked up and I saw my shadow in the middle of a rainbow.

I was in the moment and enjoying it thinking aposIaposve never seen anything like this beforeapos. In the picture, a figure can be seen hovering high above the ground - as Thomas was on the peak looking over a drop when he took the picture. He continued: People have said what an amazing and beautul shot it is and that it looks like a figure floating to the sky. Iaposm not religious but Iaposm a bit spiritual and I didnapost think how spiritual it was until I thought about it afterwards. After spotting the illusion, Thomas continued his six-hour walk with pals, Adam Maxwell, , and Matthew Bick, , who couldnapost believe what theyaposd seen. Thomas said: I shouted to my two friends but they didnapost hear so I stood on my own taking pictures. They eventually came over and they were amazed as well. It was a really good moment.

It is a classic, but have you ever stopped to think and realise just how many numbers are mentioned in the catchy tune  It is wonderfully mathematical, especially when it comes to legs. Yes you read that right.Now, as weird as that sounds, University of Oxford mathematics professor, Dr Tom Crawford, explained the importance of the number of legs in the carol in an post written for the university. Tom also has a Youtube channel, Tom Rocks Maths, where he has grown his  to .K subscribers. He explained the reason for his counting of legs, saying: “To really get to grips with the maths hidden in the  Days of Christmas we really are going to count legs.”It was a question that was posed on BBC Radio ’s Today programme a few years back, which is what originally prompted Tom to demonstrate his findings and work out the numbers hidden within the Christmas song.Tom explains that the first task is to work out what each of the named gts actually are. He explains: “I can confirm thatyou are unsure of the type of animal being mentioned, it is in fact a bird.” He then proceeded to detail the first four gts, which are as follows:  Next in the song comes the iconic line that absolutely everyone loves, all together now, “FIVE GOLD RINGS”. Tom continues: “Rings of course do not have any legs and so will add zero to our total, meaning that we can basically ignore them from this point onwards. “Gt number six is another birdin the form of a goose, which adds a further  x    legs to our total.” To mark the halfway point of the song, Tom launches into a short digression into the world of economics, saying: “With what can only be classied as ‘the world’s best idea’, the US bank PNC Wealth Management calculates the exact cost of the  items mentioned in the song using current prices to create the Christmas Price Index. I kid you not.  “It may have started as a bit of fun  years ago but is now seen by many as a reasonably accurate reflection of the ‘true cost of Christmas’. “It even takes place annually between December  and January  to provide the most accurate reflection of the  gts across each of the  days.” With this rather wild fact out of the way, Tom reaches gt number seven, a swan, which gives  x    legs to add to the ongoing total. Gt number eight brings with it a slightly more complex sum, Tom explains: Eight maids milking – two legs for each maid, plus four legs for each cow goat another farm animal that was traditionally milked by maids, gives  x    legs in total.” The final four gts all contain humans, which Tom details in the diagram below.  With the counting done and dusted, Tom delves into the mathematical insight of the puzzle, he says: “We know the total number of legs in each verseand so just need to work out how many times we sing each one. “As there are  days, and on each day, we recite the previous gts that we have received, we will mention ‘day Z’ a total of  minus Z times. “For example, the partridge verse is about day , and we sing it  minus  equals  times. Turtle doves are day  and are mentioned  –    times. “French hens are day  and are mentioned  –    times etc. This pattern continues all the way up to the final verse with our  drummers being mentioned only once.” So what happens when you put this all together  Partridge:  x    Turtle doves:  x    French hens:  x    Calling birds:  x    Rings:  x    Geese:  x    Swans:  x    Maids:  x    Ladies:  x    Lords:  x    Pipers:  x    Drummers  x    TOTAL   So there you have it, the  Days of Christmas encompasses a total of  legs - that’s certainly a fact to remember and be armed with when attending your next pub quiz.

The -year-old always had an image in her head of how she wanted to look, and sheaposs spent years achieving her dream appearance.But the dancer, who earns a fortune on OnlyFans each month, hasnapost had the best reaction to her new look, which has resulted in people calling her a demon and caused one person to run away and hide.One pal even told her they thought she looked prettier before. Kierstyn has spent £, on extreme body modications including facial tattoos, fangs, piercings and breast implants She said: “I always knew I wanted to look like this, I have had this vision in my head since I was young and have finally fulfilled it,” Kiersyn, who has over , followers on TikTok . “The way I looked before compared to now, I feel so much happier. “Before I had no self love or even understood who I was, now I feel I understand myself the most and have the most self love and confidence. “When some people see my eyes they stare and point and say nothing, others give me ugly looks, and some will straight up get in my face and say they hate it. “The craziest reactions are from people online hiding behind a screen. “They love to say, ‘you look like a demon’ or ‘you were so much prettier before,’ or ‘you must not have had a good childhood’. “But I also get people who are so sweet and say they love it and want pictures with me. And earlier this year she decided to have her most drastic bit of work done - tattooing her eyeballs. Kiestyen, from Houston, Texas, first became interested in body modications aged  and eventually got inked a year later in . In addition to tattoos, she has also spent around , on fang and breast implants, as well as piercings in her nipple, tongue, both nostrils and bridge of her nose. She said: “My family and friends weren’t surprised about my modications because it’s something I’ve always wanted but they were shocked when I tattooed my eyeballs. “I did it as a way of showing my dference and to see how shocked and offended people can get when they don’t understand something that’s not the norm of society.” Since her first inking aged , Kierstyn has had many more including a complete arm sleeve consisting of ious tributes to her family.  She also has a dream catcher, a geisha girl, scorpion and a complete arm sleeve in black, which she says helped her through periods of suffering body dysmorphia. She said: “In  I got a moth on my throat, a rose dagger on my shoulder and Hebrew writing on my neck. “This year I’ve had a butterfly on my forehead, a dagger with roses on my face, a bat underneath my breasts and my eyes tattooed. “My latest tattoo is on my stomach of butterflies and strawberries to complement the bat. “My favourite tattoo would probably be the butterfly on my head because it was such a bold move. “I’ve never wanted to fit in, Iaposve always been the odd one out.” Kierstyn has no plant to stop anytime soon and is looking to get the other side of her face inked in January . She added: “I’m not sure what I’m going to get yet and the goal is to be fully tattooed head-to-toe before next Christmas so we’ll see hopefully I can do it. “The only advice I can really give to anyone wanting to mody or tattoo themselves is: do it out of love, do it out of the fact that it will make you happy. “We should only do things that bring us joy, for me that’s what modying myself does, so I want that for othersthat’s what they chose, nothing but love and happiness.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Cosmetic surgeryPlastic surgeryPeriodsTattoos\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Rivets are normally found around the front and back pockets on jeans and theyaposre made by pressing or hammering a ‘washer’ or ‘disk’ onto a metal stud through the denim. The use of rivets on pockets dates back to  and their existence is all thanks to a tailor from Nevada named Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss  Co.Davis had been buying fabric from Levi Strauss to create clothing for miners and adding rivets to the pockets.He wrote a letter to Strauss explaining how the copper rivets helped to strengthen pockets when the miners were filling them with heavy tools.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Strauss and Davis went on to form a partnership and received a patent for an improvement in fastening pocket openings. Rivets continue to feature on jeans all these years later, appearing in places where the most strain is put on the fabric to prevent seams from splitting. As well as this, there are a number of other common items in your home which have curious uses and features.Take for instance, a Heinz bottle of tomato ketchup.If you look closely at a glass bottle of the red sauce, youaposll notice the number  above the label, just below the neck.  While this number is often thought to represent the ious dferent products Heinz makes, it turns out, itaposs also strategically placed for an important reason. According to the company, the spot is the perfect place to tap on the bottle when youaposre struggling to get ketchup out. In the trivia section of their website, they explained: To release Heinz Tomato Ketchup from its glass bottle with extra speed, apply a firm tap to the spot marked aposapos on the neck label. And have you ever wondered why the letters on your laptop or computer keyboard arenapost in alphabetical order  Some of the first keyboards invented for typewriters had the keys positioned in alphabetical order, but it soon became apparent that the arrangement didnapost work very well as the typebars would clash.  So the whole thing had to be re-arranged in order to make the machines work, taking into consideration the most common letter combinations and the frequency of use for each letter. The result was the QWERTY keyboard we use today, which was designed by Christopher Sholes. Going back a few years now to your school days, do you remember those double-coloured erasersyou had in your pencil case, where one end was red and the other was blue  That wasnapost just a fun design - each colour actually has a dferent use. Many believe the red is for erasing pencil marks and the blue side rubs out pen, but this wasnapost always the case. The red end is softer as itaposs actually meant for use on light paper, while the blue end is intended for coarser paper.  We also recently discovered that the sombrero on Sierra Tequila bottles has a aposgame-changingapos use.While some assumed it was merely a fun addition to the bottle, it turns out the sombrero can be used as a lime squeezer and the ideal item to measure out the right amount of tequila for a shot. But most interesting of all its purposes, is that the rim of the sombrero can also be used neatly salt your glass.People on Twitter lost their minds over the discovery after it was shared by Jack Mull.Iaposm shook, replied one person. Another said: You have changed everything. A third commented: WHATTTTT NO THIS CHANGES THE ENTIRE GAME.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Guge, an eight-year-old Belgian malinois, had been relaxing on the swing when he’d decided he’d had enough and wanted off. But as the ex-Australian military special forces dog hopped down from the playground equipment, the ‘sneaky swing’ banged into the dog - and Guge was having none of it. The dog spun around and chomped down on the edge of the swing with his extra strong titanium teeth.The special ops K gave his .k Instagram followers a good laugh at his reaction to being sneaked up on, with one writing: “That swing won’t sneak up on Guge again #lessonlearnt.” Another added: “He really took offence to it bumping into him didn’t he.” “Guge  - Swing ,” commented a third. Guge was formerly a trained attack dog, but retired in  on medical advice following a torn gracilis muscle. The pup was born in Croatia in May  before being imported to the Netherlands, and bought by the Australian Defence Force’s nd Commando Regiment.⁣ The TeamDogs Christmas Gt Guide, sponsored by Keep Wales Tidy, is packed with more than  treats, toys, gadgets and garments to make every dog’s tail wag with holly jolly joy on December . Weaposve tried and tested many of the gts on our own TeamDogs friends so you can ensure they’re worth placing under the tree for your most special member of the family. To download our Christmas Gt Guide for free simply subscribe to the TeamDogs newsletter.His owner, Steve, who shared Guge’s story on Instagram, said: “He began training to become a Special Ops attack-dog with his first handler. Unfortunately, Guge was injured shortly after, in Jan , rupturing his rear right ACL , and undergoing TPLO surgery with a y rehab process.⁣⁣”Guge bounced back, continuing his training and began to earn his fearsome reputation. Guge’s first handler was forced into a management role within the dog cell, which is when I came in, after ing from a deployment to Iraq.⁣” Guge and Steve became a qualied team in , working with the Tactical Assault Group - Australia’s domestic counter terrorism unit.⁣ When he wasn’t fighting crime, Guge was fathering puppies, siring a litter of  pups in . He’s even produced working dogs for the army and air force via articial insemination since.  ⁣⁣But after being forced to retire, Guge had to undertake some training to ensure he could continue living out his days with Steve as a pet, and has been ‘much loved and pampered ever since’. Belgian malinois are an intelligent and athletic breed, often used in the police force and army as working dogs for search and general purpose.TeamDogs spoke to the trainer of one malinois, called Shinga, who was beingtrained to protect rhinos in Africa.Part of Dogs  Wild, in South Wales, Shinga was getting ready for a deployment to Zimbabwe where she would be tracking humans across nature reserves, as well as act as a deterrent to poachers looking to hunt antelope, giraffes and warthogs.

The fact their data shows a reduction in speeds across the Borders is really encouraging news.\"A public consultation was also conducted, and feedback on the mph speed limits was also sought from local community councils.Using the data and feedback from the public, the report recommends that the mph limit be the \"default\" around towns and villages, with some areas retaining \"mph or mph buffer zones in place where suitable\".The buffer zones will be away from residential areas and on stretches of road \"where it is felt driving at mph is dficult to justy and particularly challenging\".Mr Edgar added: ldquoI would like to thank everyone that contributed to the public consultation, providing really valuable local insight and opinions.

While Amy is not pursuing music further , she explained that ldquoitrsquos not something I want to stop doinghellip It was probably one of my favourite subjects, probably the one I was most relaxed aboutthat makes sense. It was always a nice environment to be in and I think that helped me enjoy it a lot more.

I also love the idea of travel and going on adventures to make some memories.The class asked Abbie to reflect on and offer advice to her first year self, and she responded with ldquothe list is longhellip the main thing Irsquod say is not to be so hard on myself and to accept that set backs are important for learning just as much as success.

Euan had to show certain skills such as leadership and teamwork in order to effectively guide the school. In an interview with Euan, who is now studying Medicine at University, he highlighted how the school fire and COVID had affected his work ethic during his final few years in school, and how this has impacted the lives of not only himself but also his year group going into exams and beyond. He explained that ldquowersquod never sat proper higher exams which would have set us up for the bigger exams that we were going to have to sit further down the line so the damage from that is probably still lasting. The class asked Euan who his hero was, he very honestly answered with his grandfather, saying that he had always looked up to him due to his intelligence and bravery. When asked who his favourite teacher was at school, Euan passionately discussed how Miss Dunlop, who taught history, influenced his high school experience as ldquoshe had the entire class focused on what she was saying and she never even had to raise her voice.

She then went on to congratulate the school saying it has ldquoworked hard to ensure that pupils were still able to have a good amount of teaching with being online and there was always support available should anyone have needed it. Rachel closed her answer by admitting that ldquoit was hard to concentrate on work at home, so you really had to push yourself to stay motivated and keep on top of the workload.Rachel was asked how she felt the award carried on Campbellrsquos legacy. She responded saying that it demonstrates all of the commitment he put into Tweed Reads and his caring nature over his home community.She added: ldquoIn my sixth year of high school I heard many stories of Campbell from Tweed Reads leaders who had worked alongside him. They always said how much commitment he had to the charity and how much he cared about truly representing the ethos of the charity so therefore I feel that the Campbell Hunter prize is a true legacy of all the hard work and dedication that he put into the charity.ByRosie Dykes"},{"url":null,"title":"laws-implications-e-scooters","story":"POLICE in the Scottish Borders are warning anyone planning to purchase an e-scooter this Christmas to make sure they know the laws and implications beforehand.Using an e-scooter in a public place in Scotland is illegal.This includes roads, pavements, parks, town centres and promenades.

He started juggling with knives and balancing on one leg while standing on a giant ball!He was playing with our senses, he knew exactly how to build suspense and stretch our belief in what we thought was possible. You could hear the silenced hush of awe in the audience watching his performance.Awe is something we all need on a regular basis. In fact,you look at the science, it has a huge impact on our ability to think, investigate, make discoveries and inventions.It stimulates our curiosity and makes us feel more connected, for example to nature, to our community, to history or whatever small wonders we experience every day.John Muir often talked about being awestricken by the natural wonders he experienced. They often overwhelmed his senses and this fed his passion to protect the landscape he revered, resulting in the formation of the national parks in the USA.But his sense of awe enthralled him as a child, as he explored the shore and fields around his home town of Dunbar.Thatrsquos the thing our sense of awe is not confined to grand sights.

Who doesnrsquot How hard it is to resist the powerful messages thrown at us that fulfilment and happiness can be bought with the latest updated stuff you buy in shops that the phone you got last year is old now, you need a new one those shoes have the wrong label, you just have to have this because everyone  does. The list could be endless.Unfortunately, you canrsquot buy a sense of awe in the shops. No, wait, actually itrsquos fortunate! If it was something you had to buy then theyrsquod commody it, overprice it and, once yoursquod bought it, tell you it was now obsolete and you needed a new version!Itrsquos going to be an especially hard Christmas for so many of us this year, for so many dferent reasons, including financial ones.I get overwhelmed by it so often, and I often feel guilt that Irsquom not spending enough on gts, even though in my heart I know itrsquos not the cost that ultimately matters but the thought. The consumerist message is so powerful and universal that itrsquos dficult to opt out.But this is where cultivating our sense of awe can be so uplting, at a time when we feel so much pressure. What really makes us happy is relationships, not stuff. A thoughtful gt is part of that of course, but the awe is in the thought put into it.I think feeling a sense of awe is closely linked to being able to truly appreciate what we have and can experience.That includes the gts of kindness and generosity of people, as much as the blazing sunset or frost covered spiderrsquos web we saw a few days ago. Kindness is a gt, like the tolerant and friendly smile a stranger gave me the other day as he waited patiently in his car as I tried to fix my childrsquos seatbelt.My son noticed it too: ldquoThat was a nice man.Thankfully, kindness isnrsquot something you have to buy either itrsquos free and is not just for Christmas."},{"url":null,"title":"christmas-market-coming-dirleton","story":"After a successful first year, Dirleton Market on the Green will hold its final market of the year with a Christmas community event between am and pm.The market will offer a range of Christmas gts by local producers from a iety of stallholders ndash while Santa will make a last-minute visit before the big day.Dirleton School Partnership and Dirleton Playgroup will both have fundraising stalls offering a range of Christmas activities, competitions and prizes.Meanwhile, Dirleton author Keith Cornwell will be on site signing copies of his book Our Man On Mars.The Wee Green Van will offer bagels to keep visitors fed, wile Amalfi will serve hot drinks and ice cream."},{"url":null,"title":"sarah-boyack-msp-impressed-musselburghs-first-step-project","story":"She met project manager Tina Pollock and First Step chairperson Katherine Sangster to discuss the work it does in the community.The Labour politician enjoyed a tour of First Steprsquos base on Galt Avenue, Musselburgh, during which she spoke to its gransrsquo group, staff and children.Miss Pollock later said: ldquoMyself and our chairperson, Katherine Sangster, were delighted to welcome Sarah to the First Step project so she could see first-hand the positive impact the project is making on children and their parents in Musselburgh.ldquoSarah was impressed with the iety of services that we offer and how we were a leline for families during the Covid- pandemic.Ms Boyack said: ldquoIt was inspiring to visit the First Step Project and hear about the support they have been able to deliver families throughout Covid-.ldquoItrsquos clearly a service rooted in Musselburgh and is community led.ldquoItrsquos a model of the sort of project that supports children and their parents, delivering positive change through early intervention, but it was also good to hear from the gransrsquo group about how the project has been there for them too.First Step is a community project for families with young children.It is an independent voluntary organisation funded by East Lothian Council and other funding bodies.It was set up in  by a group of local parents who wanted somewhere safe and comfortable where they could meet and their children could play.The continued involvement of families and the local community in all aspects of First Step is said to have been key to its success.The project has developed its services to meet local needs, while continuing to be managed by a community-led management committee and employing a staff team to support local families.First Step provides: parenting support, inidually and in groups nursery provision for children aged one to four and funded eligible two-year-olds funded places for three and four-year-olds groups and courses for parents outreach and family support counselling dedicated support for young parents a grandparentsrsquo group and a dedicated family room."},{"url":null,"title":"longniddry-lit-christmas","story":"The tree, funded by the Wemyss and March Estates, was planted outside the villagersquos Royal British Legion.

Early indications are that Omicron infections generally arenrsquot as severe as others, but it is much more contagious. So itrsquos likely that a greater number of people will be infected and, evensevere illness rates are lower, the overall number of hospitalisations will be higher.Ms Stephenson rejects that, but what qualications does she have to persuade me to accept her views over those of the UKrsquos health experts  She hasnrsquot even listened to interviews with experts in the field. She says that % of the adult UK population have antibodies, so we donrsquot need to worry. As I understand it, the problem with Omicron is that it evades the antibodies, and itrsquos other aspects of the bodyrsquos response, including T-cells, that limit its severity.But what do I know  I flew aeroplanes for  years, and what I know about infectious diseases could be written on a postage stamp. What I do know is that we live in a complex world where wersquore obliged to trust specialists in every detail of our lives.I remember once having passengers complaining about not landing at our intended destination, Kolkata, and ending up in Mumbai for the night. Kolkata was foggy and it was unlikely that wersquod be able to land and,wersquod attempted to land and failed, wersquod have had insufficient fuel to reach another runway. Better the inconvenience of getting to your destination a day late than the alternative, surely.I understand why people are disappointed by restrictions, but itrsquos foolish to reject expert advice and rely instead on a wing and a prayer. As Neil Mackay pointed out , itrsquos those who wonrsquot accept their responsibilities to their fellow citizens who are perpetuating this crisis, not the experts who give their best advice.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.WHERE IS THE ANTI-VAXXERS LOGIC MORE power to Neil Mackay. I did not agree with everything he said, for instance about sub-literates. The anti-vax lot includes a good proportion of the well-educated. Many of the Covid patients currently straining the capacity of German hospitals are of the bourgeoisie. An articulate but a bittie daft minority readily leaps to this barricade. I find that a puzzle.Meanwhile, as I have seen myself visiting a close relative, this has left our own NHS reeling. Nurses exhausted and detached, working -hour shts and staying on unpaid to get things done. And that nice Mrs Patel hunting all those foreign workers back home hasnt helped, but they will not want for employment where, so others will get the good of them.As a medic relative explained, Covid is not a nice way to go. I lost a valued acquaintance to it before any vaccine was available, and there have been several close shaves with others who have been smitted, but the hinner end fended off by vaccine. Oh, learn to live with it, they say. Well, consider the lives cut short by smallpox, crippled by polio, or the scourge of TB that went through Scotlands country areas like a kne. All left a trail of heartbreak and wreckage. Would the anti-vaxxers like that back  I cannot suppose so. But where is their logic and sense of social responsibility Gavin Sprott, Edinburgh.* OH to be a fly on the wall in a room with just Neil Mackay and Joanne Blythman present.Sue Wade, Ayr.HOSPITALITY MUST BITE THE BULLETPERMIT me to respond to William Goldrsquos objectionsto a vaccination passport system for entry into bars, restaurants, cafes and the like. I fear he has missed the point, that point being thatthat the incidence of Covid increases at the predicted rate then all the objections to a passport system will be moot we will be back to an indeterminate enforced lockdown and the Hielan Jessie Bar and every other bar and restaurant will be closed, many permanently.Mr Gold lists objections, citing the Licensing Scotland Act . Objections and reasons to do nothing are always easier than concrete action. The Scottish Government introduces new rules and regulations regarding Covid at a couple of days notice surely the hospitality industry has the resources to prevail upon the Government to introduce practical measures to check a vaccination passport  Furthermore, every pub that I have ever been incarries a notice stating that proof of identity may be required to very a legal drinking age. Consequently I assume that every pub employs at least one SIA-qualied person. No-one is suggesting that the passport is checked immediately upon entry, although that would be preferable. In Paris a waiter or barperson would always ask before taking an order, sometimes at the door, sometimes at your table. The point being that there would be no service without proof of vaccination.Look at what countries on the Continent are doing now: France ndash compulsory presentation of vaccination passport for all bars, cafes and restaurants. Ireland, ditto Germany, ditto Italy, ditto from January  Netherlands, bars, restaurants and the like closed from pm need I go on I sympathise with Mr Gold, the hospitality industry has taken a beating, but I sympathise more with those who have lost loved ones and those who are still suffering the after-effects of this dreadful disease. And, no, I am not conflating the objections of the hospitality sector with those selfish few who refuse to be vaccinated. Buta small section of society refuse to play by the social norms and duties then unfortunately the rest of us have to accept some measure of minor inconvenience, and that includes the hospitality industry.Robert Buntin, Skelmorlie.WE NEED TO LIVE WITH THISI AM no Covid denier, no vax denier, Irsquove had my two jags and booster. Covid  is a bad virus, impacted the lives of millions and killed millions. The world economy apparently has been devastated, the poor once again suffering the most. The richest somehow have increased their wealth in these times.I am at a complete loss to understand how we are dealing with this new Omicron iant. I have never heard so many so-called experts using words and phrases like \"we donrsquot know\", \"may\", \"might\", \"could be\" and so on. Then we get who I think are the silenced experts, who say Omicron is actually not as bad, yes seems to spread quicker, but at the time of writing no deaths and no increase in hospitalisations connected to this iant.There is a creeping suggestion of new measures, stopping things, changing how we live and impacting on Christmas, families and business.Stop. We need to live with this. It is bad, worse than the flu. Is it worse than cancer, heart disease and the like  A loved one dying of Covid is no worse than a loved one dying from a preventable disease.Letrsquos get this into perspective and start living again.Paul McPherson, Newtonmore.PUT THIRD JAG ON THE RECORDTHE Scottish Government is quite rightly encouraging all iniduals to get their third booster vaccination as soon as they are entitled to it. I downloaded a copy of my vaccination letters from the NHS website at the start of September, having had my first and second doses, and the letter states: ldquoThis is your NHS Scotland record of vaccination. Keep it safe.I attended for my booster jag two weeks ago and after receiving it I inquired how long it would be before I could download an updated copy of my vaccination status. I was astonished to be told that records in the public domain would not be updated with booster details.Currently when I access my vaccination details on the NHS Inform website, it confirms under ldquoappointments that Irsquove had my third booster vaccination, but this is not reflected in my online vaccination ldquorecord. As such, it is not an accurate record of my vaccinations. If getting the third dose is so important then it is surely important enough to be incorporated in our vaccination record. I have written to the Scottish Government on this matter and await a response.Brian Watt, Edinburgh.* IN the last few days the BMA has declared that being asthmatic is not an exemption to wearing masks. The websites of Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation make similar statements. They even claim that masks do not reduce your oxygen supply or increase CO levels.My own late mother used an inhaler and got very breathless and I cant imagine her wearing a mask. In my view this decision is nothing to do with our medical well-being.Geoff Moore, Alness."},{"url":null,"title":"stardust-find-previously-unheard-bowie-track-set-fetch-thousands-auction","story":"Now, a previously unheard David Bowie song, recorded in  when he was aged , has been discovered ndash and could fetch thousands of poundsat auction as interest surges in the sale amongst fans of the British star.The tune, I Want Your Love, by David Bowie And The Lower Third was written by John Dee and Jack Tarr.Bowie was then working with US record producer Shel Talmy and, according to the publishing database and Shel Talmy archives, it was also producedby him.The band were hired to demo the song and it is described as a ldquofull-on The Who-style assault with slashing guitars and David Bowiersquos distinctive vocalsrsquorsquo.The acetate came from the archives of one of the UKrsquos biggest publishing companies.Auctioneers say it has probably never been played until now and is in excellent condition.It is expected to fetch between pound, to pound, at Wessex Auction Rooms when the sale goes ahead on December .A spokesman said: ldquoThis previously unreleased and unheard David Bowie recording has come to light from an amazing archive haul, and is by far the best of the bunch.ldquoThe seller purchased the physical music archive of one of the worldrsquos biggest publishing firms and unearthed a raft of amazing demos and unheard tracks from huge artists.ldquoIt takes months of work going through databases to get the info but we really have discovered the cream of the crop.rsquorsquoIt comes as an album originally recorded by Bowie for a  release, which was held up by what is described as ldquorecord label politics, and later scuppered bya leak on the internet,is finally released.Toy has been made available as part of the ldquoBrilliant Adventure box set, two decades later than intended, featuring reworkings of Bowie songs from the late s and early s."},{"url":null,"title":"new-city-bus-tour-shows-glasgow-music-miles-better","story":"Now, in recognition of Glasgow connection to music down through the years, a new city open top tour bus is set to add a musical journey to its sightseeing offerings, with the perfect Glaswegian lined up to narrate the cityrsquos musical heritage.City Sightseeing Glasgowrsquos music tour, which will be available on channel eight of the on-bus commentary system from January  of next year, will showcase Glasgowrsquos vast musical history, while promoting some of the cityrsquos most iconic music venues at the same time, including King Tutrsquos, Barrowlands, The Royal Concert Hall, SWG and the Ovo Hydro to name a few.The music tour will be narrated by the renowned multi-award-winning singer songwriter, Eddi Reader.Famed for her chart topping single Perfect with band Fairground Attraction, Ms Readers recognisable voice is rooted in the heart of British music with a number of musical genres under her bow including, pop, folk music and her musical interpretation of the work of Scottish poet, Robert Burns.Written on behalf of City Sightseeing Glasgow by Glasgow Music City Tours co-founder Fiona Shepherd, the tour will reveal Glasgowrsquos close relationship with music throughout history with a range of interesting stories, facts, and some insider knowledge from Ms Reader herself on what exactly makes Glasgow such a wonderful, vibrant and musical city.Ms Reader said: ldquoI adore my town - it gave me music and romantic dreams that set me on a path to the future.\"Irsquom honoured to be given the opportunity to tell people all about the creative spirit of Glasgow, how it seeps out of every sandstone corner and shines out of every Glaswegian.\"From the song schools of centuries ago, to the musical geniuses that inspired the world.\"Follow me along the road while I show you the musical beauty of my town past, present and future.That past includes the formation of bands such as Jim Kerr and Charlie Burchills Simple Minds, as well as the discovery of Oasis, famously signed to a label after a gig at Glasgows King Tuts in .

It would almost be better to have a regulation and a furlough scheme.#Sharing doubts over what number of people and what premises they attended actually constituted a #party#, he added: #Given that it#s best according to the authorities to avoid party situations then from a business point of view, we need support.#We need some clarity followed by some support.#The BID chairman#s comments came as leaders of all four UK nations are set to meet to discuss the rising levels of the new Omicron iant of COVID-.

We are well underway with our vaccination boosters and aim to have all booster vaccines administered by the middle of January with all appointment letters out before Christmas.#From tomorrowall household contacts of confirmed cases, Omicron or not, need to isolate for  days regardless of vaccination status or a negative PCR result. Non-household contacts can end isolation after receiving a negative PCR resultdouble vaccinated and have no symptoms.#These changes to isolation for household contacts of COVID- will have an impact across the community, and NHS Orkney has robust business continuity plans to help us deliver our key services.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1639060616576.jpg--covid_19___thu_9th_december_figures.jpg?1639060617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211209newscovid 19 thu 9th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

We will be asking when we can get supplies of this vaccine in Northern Ireland.“If I lived in Hungary or Serbia, I wouldn’t be having this discussion — because those vaccines are readily available there.”First Minister Paul Givan will tomorrow line up with his DUP colleagues in Stormont to oppose a policy that less than two months ago he himself publicly listed as a Covid- related contingency option for winter.The plan, which is signed by the First and Deputy First Minister, lays out options for measures the Executive agreed it could take “to slow the spread of the virus” should the pandemic deteriorate.It included the potential to deploy Covid status certication “in higher risk settings” — yet in the Assembly tomorrow Givan and the DUP will reject the Executive-backed proposal, describing it as a “step too far”.The autumn winter plan states thatcase numbers rise sharply orhospital pressures become unsustainable, it would legislate for certication “ considered appropriate and necessary”.But since its publication the new iant Omicron has emerged — with three cases discovered last week — and hospital occupancy as of Friday was at pc.Among the most vocal politician on vaccine passports is DUP MLA Paul Frew.He believes vaccine passports “will cause deep resentment in the community, increase distrust and hesitancy”.While he has insisted that he is “not anti-vax”, Mr Frew has posted messages on social media saying that he was “totally opposed to government coercion and discrimination”.It follows more than a year of mixed messaging from Stormont’s largest party, with many accusing the party’s MLAs and MPs of confusing the public and undermining the response to the virus.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood has said the attitude of some DUP members throughout the pandemic “has been a disgrace”, adding that “they have actively undermined the public health message at every opportunity”.Most ReadCountry music singers Aidan Taaffe and ‘Cowboy’ Larry Taaffe, along with third brother Michael Taaffe, all accused of raping same womanFormer journalist Martina Purdy given second chance to become a nunDUP MLA Jim Wells leading delegation of clergy to call for an alternative Covid- vaccinationNorthern Ireland health service ‘pulling out all the stops’ to match England’s goal to provide Covid booster for all over s amid Omicron ‘tidal wave’Jamie Dornan: People think Northern Ireland is like the Gaza StripTop VideosPlayPolice chiefs refused to pay overtime to officers assigned to Noah Donohoe search operationPlayWatch: Passengers given sick bags as flight attempts to land at Dublin Airport during Storm BarraPlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern IrelandPSNI appealing for info on missing Carrickfergus woman Debbie CrothersGlenanne Gang member Garfield Beattie loses appeal against prison sentence and has duration extendedGovernment not listening to people in Northern Ireland, new shadow secretary Peter Kyle warnsMan arrested after ‘substantial amount’ of drugs found on Belfast’s Ormeau embankmentNorthern Ireland must brace for Omicron ‘storm’, Paul Givan warnsLatestRalf Rangnick would be happy to clinch another ‘dirty’ victory at BrentfordArmed forces drafted in to help deliver boostersPSNI appealing for info on missing Carrickfergus woman Debbie CrothersPeople unable to order home lateral flow tests online told there is ‘sufficient stock’ at ‘collection sites’Tottenham planning for Leicester game to go ahead after Covid- outbreak,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Primark shops in the Netherlands have been hit by restrictions in trading hours, in Germany customers need vaccine passes, while its five shops in Austria have all closed. But in the months ahead things are unlikely to get worse than they were at the same time last year, when most of the chain’s shops were closed. Between December and April sales are expected to be “signicantly better” than in the same period a year earlier, AB Foods told shareholders. The business also has several other wings, including grocery, sugar, ingredients and agriculture businesses. These have all traded in line with expectations since the start of the financial year in September. “We are experiencing the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations and our businesses have been working hard to overcome these dficulties,” AB Foods said. “We have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities and we have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

These have all traded in line with expectations since the start of the financial year in September. “We are experiencing the impact of widely reported port congestion and road freight limitations and our businesses have been working hard to overcome these dficulties,” AB Foods said. “We have seen an escalation in the cost of energy, logistics and commodities and we have been implementing plans to offset these through operational cost savings and, where necessary, the implementation of price increases.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby.

The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern.

Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Niamh said: “I want to model full time which is one of the reasons I entered the competition. I model around Derry and Belfast and one of the photographers I work with in Derry sent me a link online to enter the competition. “The next day the organiser of the competition, Greg, rang me and told me I was accepted and walked me through the next steps. “It was my first ever show and I had no experience in runway modelling. I wanted to enter because I thought it would be a great way to get experience of runway modelling and performing in front of crowds. It’s also a great way to get more exposure all around Ireland and beyond.” In a normal year, without Covid restrictions, the competition normally has three stages A photoshoot workshop, a fitness workshop and then the finals. This year, due to Covid, there was one photoshoot workshopin October last year in Dublin and the fitness workshop was cancelled as it wasn’t possible to do with social distancing. The finals which were originally supposed to be held in December  but they were delayed to January this year as a result of lockdown. This was then delayed again to allow for a more normal setting for the finals. Niamh continued: “The finals took place this weekend, December , so it’s been a long road. “The competition is full of challenges and tests to see that the winner is fit to head off and represent Ireland at swimsuit USA in America. “So, throughout the competition the photoshoots and workshops and working with other brands is all a test for howprofessionalyou are and how well you can work with photographers, brands and other models. “It’s also about a healthy body and lestyle so they’re looking for someone who is passionate about physical and mental health. “For example, one of our challenges throughout was promoting our sponsor, Beauty Belle, on social media s and doing weekly posts. Then, the big challenge at the final to test how confident you are in front of a crowd. “I absolutely loved the experience and I’m so grateful for it, the final reallywasa night I’ll always remember. “I was terried when I was travelling to Limerick but when I got there and out on stage I was really in my element and it confirmed this is exactly the kind of thing that I want to continue doing in the future. “I love the rush I get being out of my comfort zone andthatswhat modelling does for me, nerves are good. “I was disappointed that so many of the opportunities throughout were held off or not able to happen because of Covid, I would’ve really liked to spend more time with the other girls and get to know them more as they were lovely and made the whole experience.

I am calling on the Education Minister to introduce regulations to cap unorm costs and provide statutory guidance to schools to ensure school unorms are made affordable for families. “A recent poll of parents showed that % were concerned about the rising costs of unorms and PE gear, while % said they getinto debt to cover the costs. Unorms and PE gear are costing parents hundreds of pounds, per-child, every year. This is unacceptable and must be addressed. With the cost of living rising, urgent action is needed to support families and I am calling on theEducation Minister to legislate to ease the burden of school unorm costs.

Since April of this year, there have been  donors and families who have enabled  patients to receive a le-saving transplant in Northern Ireland. Statistics have shown that % of people in Northern Ireland support organ donation, but only % have signed the Organ Donor Register. Mayor Warke said: Making the decision on whether or not to become an organ donor is a big decision and a personal one for each inidual. Its important that we all take the time to think about our own choice, and to share that choice with our family and friends. Christmas is a time for giving, and one of the greatest gts that any of us could give is the gt of le. The statistics around organ donation are really quite incredible. One organ donor can save the lives of up to nine people, and with around  iniduals currently on the waiting list in Northern Ireland, every single donor makes a huge dference to potentially saving someones le. Its vitally important to remember that loved ones will always be involved before any organ donation can go ahead. Given the fact that only half of families agree to donatethey dont know their loved ones decision, but  out of  will support itthey know their loved one wanted to donate, Id ask everyone to please share their choice. By doing so you could save lives. You can record your decision around donation on the NHS Organ Donation Register atwww.organdonationni.info  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Mayor of Derry, Alderman Grahame Warke and Bishops Donal McKeown and Brian Forster feature in the emotional film produced as a tribute to the pandemic. The film tells the story of the restrictions placed on families and friends, who never really got an opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones.  The film featues very sensitive and emotional tribute paid to a loved one who passed away by the recital of the poem Goodbye by Thornhill pupil, Tieghan Doherty, at the end of the film.  Joseph McCarthy, the writer, director and producer of Grief, thanked everyone involved in the production of the film and Derry and Strabane District Council and Derry Credit Union for supporting it.  He added: “Paddy Simpson, from Brunswick Moviebowl who screened the film and was very supportive of Grief, deserves a special word of thanks, as do Charles Bradley and Joe Parke from Bradley and McLaughlin Undertakers, Bishop Forster, Bishop McKeown and Mayor Warke.” The film can be viewed on YouTube by means of several links on Black North Productions’ Facebook page and has had over  views in less than a week. Next up for the local film company will be their anti-bullying film, Summary Justice, which deals with the ongoing issue of bullying in schools and will involve local pupils, parents, several teachers and the principal of Saint Saviours College, where most of the action takes place.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Now, more than  years on, Marie-Claire revisited the project to see how Irish identity has changed. The book contains the personal reflections of  contributors from a iety of sectors, backgrounds and viewpoints on their identity and what it means to them to ‘be Irish, The contributions come from the ranks of the famous and not so famous, people at the centre of things and people at the margins, people who live in Ireland and those who live abroad, the Irish and not-Irish-but-interested. Contributors include Lisa McGee, playwright and writer of Derry GirlsDr Teresa Lambe, co-inventor of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine General Martin Dempsey, former chair- person of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the US Mervyn Gibson, Grand Secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Merlin Holland, Oscar Wilde’s only grandchild well-known broad- caster Eamonn HolmesNorthern Irish jockeyAP McCoy singer- songwriter Ryan McMullan Irish Olympian, Sonia O’Sullivan and many more. Speaking on the book and her decision to edit it now, Marie-Claire said: “Having both lived and travelled outside Ireland, I became aware of how strong the sense of identity was amongst the Irish. I was also conscious that change was sweeping across the Island of Ireland and I was curious to discover just how robust or fluid Irish identity was during this time of profound change.” “Above all, the reflections in the book show that there are many ways of being Irish. We can be Irish by birth, Irish by ancestry, Irish by geography, Irish and British, Irish by accident, Northern Irish, Irish by necessity, Irish and European, Irish by association, Irish by culture, Irish and American and Irish by choice. “The collection is a tribute to the honesty of the contributors, and I would like to record how much I appreciate their commitment. “It started as a passion project for me, a topic I was genuinely curious. “Themore I spoke with the dferent contributors and read their stories, the more I was convinced of the books signicance as a snapshot of Irish identity today. It was a real privilege to work on it, and a welcome distraction during lockdown.” She concluded: “Becoming a parent has made me think about what this book will look like for my own two children in  years time, and that was a big motivator for me.” The contributors were encouraged to be as open and honest as possible with the intention of the book being completely inclusive and non-judgmental. All were asked the same questions: What does Irish identity mean to you personally  Why do  million people worldwide embrace their Irish heritage  Are we navel-gazing  Or are there real changes in attitude taking place in Ireland and among the Irish worldwide  Published by Lfey Press,Being Irish:  views on Irish Identity, is availablefrom local independent bookshop Little Acorn Book Store on Foyle Street as well as all major bookstores and online.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Now, more than  years on, Marie-Claire revisited the project to see how Irish identity has changed. The book contains the personal reflections of  contributors from a iety of sectors, backgrounds and viewpoints on their identity and what it means to them to ‘be Irish, The contributions come from the ranks of the famous and not so famous, people at the centre of things and people at the margins, people who live in Ireland and those who live abroad, the Irish and not-Irish-but-interested. Contributors include Lisa McGee, playwright and writer of Derry GirlsDr Teresa Lambe, co-inventor of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine General Martin Dempsey, former chair- person of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the US Mervyn Gibson, Grand Secretary of the Grand Orange Lodge of Ireland Merlin Holland, Oscar Wilde’s only grandchild well-known broad- caster Eamonn HolmesNorthern Irish jockeyAP McCoy singer- songwriter Ryan McMullan Irish Olympian, Sonia O’Sullivan and many more. Speaking on the book and her decision to edit it now, Marie-Claire said: “Having both lived and travelled outside Ireland, I became aware of how strong the sense of identity was amongst the Irish. I was also conscious that change was sweeping across the Island of Ireland and I was curious to discover just how robust or fluid Irish identity was during this time of profound change.” “Above all, the reflections in the book show that there are many ways of being Irish. We can be Irish by birth, Irish by ancestry, Irish by geography, Irish and British, Irish by accident, Northern Irish, Irish by necessity, Irish and European, Irish by association, Irish by culture, Irish and American and Irish by choice. “The collection is a tribute to the honesty of the contributors, and I would like to record how much I appreciate their commitment. “It started as a passion project for me, a topic I was genuinely curious. “Themore I spoke with the dferent contributors and read their stories, the more I was convinced of the books signicance as a snapshot of Irish identity today. It was a real privilege to work on it, and a welcome distraction during lockdown.” She concluded: “Becoming a parent has made me think about what this book will look like for my own two children in  years time, and that was a big motivator for me.” The contributors were encouraged to be as open and honest as possible with the intention of the book being completely inclusive and non-judgmental. All were asked the same questions: What does Irish identity mean to you personally  Why do  million people worldwide embrace their Irish heritage  Are we navel-gazing  Or are there real changes in attitude taking place in Ireland and among the Irish worldwide  Published by Lfey Press,Being Irish:  views on Irish Identity, is availablefrom local independent bookshop Little Acorn Book Store on Foyle Street as well as all major bookstores and online.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The SDLP published their energy costs action plan last week and Mr Durkan called for a payment of up to pound, to be extended to all households in receipt of Universal Credit. The payment would help families top up their gas cards and fill their oil tanks so that they would be able to heat their homes over the winter without worrying about how to pay for it. Mr Durkan said: “Given the steep rise in energy bills over the last few months there are families across the North struggling to heat their homes this winter. “In the absence of any action from the Joint First Ministers or Minister Hargey to mitigate the situation the SDLP has produced a number of proposals in our energy costs action plan to try and help people through this very dficult period. “While energy bills are increasing by hundreds of pounds a year, Universal Credit claimants, who are already struggling to get by, have seen their payments cruelly cut by pound a week by the Tory government and waved through by Sinn Feacutein. “These people were barely able to cover their bills before the recent price hikes and I cannot see how they will able to meet these massive costs. “In an attempt to help the people who really need it I’m calling for the winter fuel payment, a modest payment of up to pound, to be extended to all households in receipt of Universal Credit. “This money will allow families to top up their gas cards and fill their oil tanks to get them through this winter, then we can focus on tackling the long-term issues around fuel poverty. “I’m also calling on the Department for Communities to work with the Department for Health to explore how families with children with disabilities can be supported to cope with rising energy costs. “It’s disgraceful that we are already in the grip of winter and no plan has been forthcoming to help low income families deal with these mounting issues. “I will continue lobbying Minister Hargey and doing all I can to secure immediate support for the people who need it most.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

As part of his tour, the Mayor visited businesses in the heart of the city centre, including the Craft Village and in the Waterside. He also visited businesses in the outskirts of town at Maydown and in Eglinton and later in the week spent time with traders in Strabane. This past  months have been an extremely challenging time for local businesses, and Derry City  Strabane District Council is keen to inspire confidence among the public by encouraging them to shop local. The Council has been working closely with the business community throughout the pandemic, delivering a range of support from bespoke advice to essential grant aid. Mayor Warke said: “Local businesses have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. “Now during the busiest shopping period of the year, it’s vitally important that we support these local traders as much as possible. “These independently owned businesses are what makes our City and District unique and I was delighted to see the products and wares they have on offer, particularly for Christmas gts. I would encourage the public, as much as possible, to spend local this year.” Business Development Officer with Derry City and Strabane District Council, Tara Nicholas, reiterated the Mayor’s comments adding: “Mayor Warke has heard first-hand from traders about the dficulties they have been facing throughout the pandemic. “They have also shared with the us the sense of ‘community spirit and support’ they have been receiving from their customers. “We have a great opportunity to help our home-grown, independent businesses here flourish. “Deciding to shop local really makes a huge dference to our local traders and we shouldn’t underestimate how impactful even our small spends can be. “Our independent stores and shops employ so many local staff and by supporting them, we are making a great choice in terms of supporting ourselves.” Find out more about the campaign at:shoplocalderrystrabane   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The Mayor was promoting a shop local drive for ChristmasReporter: Matthew Leslie Dec Email: matthew.leslie@iconicnews.ie  addthis, Mayor Graham Warke has urged Derrys festive shoppers to shop local this Christmas during his whistle-stop tour of businesses and shops throughout the city. googletag.cmd.push Last week the Mayor visited a number of retail outlets and shops to find out how local traders are finding the Christmas shopping season. As part of his tour, the Mayor visited businesses in the heart of the city centre, including the Craft Village and in the Waterside. He also visited businesses in the outskirts of town at Maydown and in Eglinton and later in the week spent time with traders in Strabane. This past  months have been an extremely challenging time for local businesses, and Derry City  Strabane District Council is keen to inspire confidence among the public by encouraging them to shop local. The Council has been working closely with the business community throughout the pandemic, delivering a range of support from bespoke advice to essential grant aid. Mayor Warke said: “Local businesses have worked tirelessly throughout the pandemic. “Now during the busiest shopping period of the year, it’s vitally important that we support these local traders as much as possible. “These independently owned businesses are what makes our City and District unique and I was delighted to see the products and wares they have on offer, particularly for Christmas gts. I would encourage the public, as much as possible, to spend local this year.” Business Development Officer with Derry City and Strabane District Council, Tara Nicholas, reiterated the Mayor’s comments adding: “Mayor Warke has heard first-hand from traders about the dficulties they have been facing throughout the pandemic. “They have also shared with the us the sense of ‘community spirit and support’ they have been receiving from their customers. “We have a great opportunity to help our home-grown, independent businesses here flourish. “Deciding to shop local really makes a huge dference to our local traders and we shouldn’t underestimate how impactful even our small spends can be. “Our independent stores and shops employ so many local staff and by supporting them, we are making a great choice in terms of supporting ourselves.” Find out more about the campaign at:shoplocalderrystrabane   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency. If [the bans] are being applied, they have to be consistent.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Pic by Inpho Photography.Reporter: Daragh Ó Conchúir Dec Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, All-Ireland senior camogie semi-final Slaughtneil - googletag.cmd.push Oulart-the-Ballagh- First-half goals from Wexford legends Uacutena Leacy and Ursual Jacob and eight points from play by the Kehoe twins, Shelley and Stacey, ended Slaughtneil’s bid for a fth consecutive AIB All-Ireland senior club camogie final appearance, as  champions Oulart-The Ballagh held the former three-in-a-row victors at arm’sin the second half to prevail at Donaghmore Ashbourne by - to -. Oulart have another giant to slay in next Saturday’s decider at Nowlan Park as titleholders Sarsfields lie in wait following their - to - victory over Drom  Inch yesterday. On this evidence, they look more than capable of doing so, their wealth of experience and scoring power capable of accounting for any outfit on a going day, with apart from the aforementioned, the likes of skipper and another ex-Model County hero Mary Leacy, Ciara Storey, Anais Curran and Aideen Brennan all involved. A ruthless first-half showing with the wind laid the groundwork for the victors, as it forced their Derry opponents to discard their tried and trusted system of restriction. This meant that even as they had the elements in the second half, more gaps existed than they would normally allow and they were capitalised upon by Oulart. Given the final margin, the opening nine minutes were hugely signicant, at the end of which the red and blacks led by - to -. After Shauna Sinnott pointed almost from the throw-in, Stacey Kehoe and Jacob slotted a pair apiece before Uacutena Leacy planted just the latest in a career of major goals, making no mistake after Shelley Kehoe drew the cover with a run through the middle. Former Offaly star Tina Bradley, who gave birth to her first child earlier this year, slotted a couple of minors for Slaughtneill as they steadied the ship and added a third after winning a free from which Louise Dougan converted to leave it - to - at the first water break.

Cliodhna Niacute Mhianaacutein reduced the margin to a goal but catastrophe struck when following Shelley Kehoe’s point, Jacob’s free from m was deflected unfortunately by Dougan beyond Jolene Bradley to put seven between them once more. That margin had grown to ten by the interval and the Robert Emmets never looked like reeling it in from - to -. They tried valiantly, as you would expect however, Therese Mallon goaling in the first minute of the second half after a block by Ceacuteat McEldowney of Katie Gallagher’s attempted clearance. Orla McNeill followed quickly with a point but the Oulart riposte was notable, Uacutena Leacy, Shauna Sinnott and Shelley Kehoe firing the last three points of the third quarter to make it - to -. They only had to avoid a collapse from that juncture and with such experience in their ranks, that was never going to happen. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

Pic by Inpho Photography.Reporter: Daragh Ó Conchúir Dec Email: sport@derrypost  addthis, All-Ireland senior camogie semi-final Slaughtneil - googletag.cmd.push Oulart-the-Ballagh- First-half goals from Wexford legends Uacutena Leacy and Ursual Jacob and eight points from play by the Kehoe twins, Shelley and Stacey, ended Slaughtneil’s bid for a fth consecutive AIB All-Ireland senior club camogie final appearance, as  champions Oulart-The Ballagh held the former three-in-a-row victors at arm’sin the second half to prevail at Donaghmore Ashbourne by - to -. Oulart have another giant to slay in next Saturday’s decider at Nowlan Park as titleholders Sarsfields lie in wait following their - to - victory over Drom  Inch yesterday. On this evidence, they look more than capable of doing so, their wealth of experience and scoring power capable of accounting for any outfit on a going day, with apart from the aforementioned, the likes of skipper and another ex-Model County hero Mary Leacy, Ciara Storey, Anais Curran and Aideen Brennan all involved. A ruthless first-half showing with the wind laid the groundwork for the victors, as it forced their Derry opponents to discard their tried and trusted system of restriction. This meant that even as they had the elements in the second half, more gaps existed than they would normally allow and they were capitalised upon by Oulart. Given the final margin, the opening nine minutes were hugely signicant, at the end of which the red and blacks led by - to -. After Shauna Sinnott pointed almost from the throw-in, Stacey Kehoe and Jacob slotted a pair apiece before Uacutena Leacy planted just the latest in a career of major goals, making no mistake after Shelley Kehoe drew the cover with a run through the middle. Former Offaly star Tina Bradley, who gave birth to her first child earlier this year, slotted a couple of minors for Slaughtneill as they steadied the ship and added a third after winning a free from which Louise Dougan converted to leave it - to - at the first water break.

Cliodhna Niacute Mhianaacutein reduced the margin to a goal but catastrophe struck when following Shelley Kehoe’s point, Jacob’s free from m was deflected unfortunately by Dougan beyond Jolene Bradley to put seven between them once more. That margin had grown to ten by the interval and the Robert Emmets never looked like reeling it in from - to -. They tried valiantly, as you would expect however, Therese Mallon goaling in the first minute of the second half after a block by Ceacuteat McEldowney of Katie Gallagher’s attempted clearance. Orla McNeill followed quickly with a point but the Oulart riposte was notable, Uacutena Leacy, Shauna Sinnott and Shelley Kehoe firing the last three points of the third quarter to make it - to -. They only had to avoid a collapse from that juncture and with such experience in their ranks, that was never going to happen. *Full coverage in Tuesdays County Derry Post.

I, like many other families, cycle with my we and three small children and this space and environment to enjoy that time together safely and without fear of accident or injury is a blessing, said Cllr Lewis.ldquoNewry Mourne and Down Council proudly supports active and healthy communities and this cycle lane connects the local council to Stormont in a collective effort to improve the health and wellbeing of residents through the promotion of cycling and the enjoyment of outdoor leisure.Cllr Lewis also congratulated his Slieve Croob colleague, Cllr Andrew McMurray, who has been proactive in ensuring the district is marked on the map in terms of provision of safe cycle routes.He also revealed that Cllr McMurray has challenged him to a timed lap of the new route when it opens and hopes the event will raise money for a local charity, while the duo have a bit of fun along the way.Cllr Lewis said he has asked the Department for Infrastructure to consider the needs of those who need access to agricultural land that runs adjacent to the new pathway and cycling route, during construction and when it is completed.ldquoLand along this particular route is utilised for barley, potatoes and grazing, with the ground rotated each season which means that the fields are regularly in use throughout the year, he explained.ldquoPolice regularly pull in farmers driving along this stretch of road requesting that they facilitate traffic flow by waiting in a lay-by, allowing the build-up of traffic behind them to pass.Cllr Lewis said he has asked the government department consider how itrsquos going to accommodate agricultural or slow-moving traffic, suggesting that the original lay-by structure in the area needs to be maintained and protected to allow for safe access.He added: ldquoThese issues certainly arenrsquot impediments nor am I seeking to cause an obstruction.

I am contacted about cleansing issues on a daily basis and while working with council staff a solution is found, butrobust processes and procedures were in place, this should be routinely completed and no major issues should arise.Cllr Sharvin says he is also keen to see greater attention on cleaning play parks, explaining that currently there is no formal process to do so and operates on adhoc basis.ldquoGiven the increase of use play parks during Covid and the councilrsquos objective to increase healthy living in our communities, itrsquos vitality important that we clean and maintain our play parks on a regular basis. Council officials have agreed to replace surface safety tiles at our play parks and I hope this programme will continue to be rolled out, he said.Cllr Sharvin said that following the recent workshop, council officers are to compile a report which will be discussed by councillors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"District’s battering from Storm Barra  ","story":"DOWN District was pummelled by Storm Barra yesterday with gale force winds and driving rain coinciding with a spring high tide to wreak havoc.Thunder and lightning was added into the heady weather mix with the storm conditions bringing down a number of trees along the coastline.

He and his we, Charlotte, live near Edinburgh and have three sons, Angus, Jack and Hector.His introduction to rowing came only six years ago when he took up skf racing. He competed at the  world championships in Strangford Lough where he won a silver medal and went on to win two gold medals at the  world championships in Stranraer.Clive admits to being highly competitive and that after winning world titles he was looking to take another step forward.A TV documentary about explorer Ben Fogle and Olympic rower James Cracknell rowing across the Atlantic fired his imagination and he signed up for the Talisker Atlantic Challenge in January  along with his medal-winning team-mates, Ian Baird, Duncan Hughes and Ross McKinney, plus a friend, Fraser Potter.They formed a team, Five in a Row, and then set about putting their project together, which involved the not inconsiderable matter of raising pound, to cover their costs.They managed to get the money and then obtained a boat, which, they were delighted to learn, had been rowed by three Scottish brothers in a previous Atlantic Challenge race.Clive says: ldquoIt was tough going, but we managed to raise the money. The boat is excellent, but we tried to lighten it as much as possible in order to make easier.

pop royalty and real-le royalty, George Lowdenrsquos guitars are known to be the best in the world.The Prince of Wales recently made known his knowledge of and fascination with Georgersquos guitars and Ed Sheeran reportedly likes to keep one handy in nearly every room of his house.With Niall Horan of One Direction and Dubliner singer songwriter Dermot Kennedy becoming the latest owners of the bespoke guitars, Georgersquos company, Lowden Guitars, has just announced its latest collaboration with Sheeran.To celebrate the release of his most recent album, Sheeran has teamed up with George, who founded the firm in , to design and create a signature guitar worthy of music royalty.The Sheeran by Lowden Equals Edition guitar will also be available to the public to purchase, with a limited edition run of , available through Lowdenrsquos global dealer network.Itrsquos the second joint project with Sheeran, following on from their range of more affordable guitars.The latest achievement comes in the wake of George recently meeting the Prince of Wales at a Windsor Castle reception to mark Lowden Guitars winning the  Queenrsquos Awards for Enterprise.He also launched a new range of limited edition guitars to mark his th birthday over the summer which features specications chosen by George.Itrsquos all a far cry from when the renowned luthier first began to hand-make guitars for his own use.He could never have known that his determination to make the best guitar would see his name travel around the world and be spoken of by royalty.ldquoTherersquos quite a lot of things that have happened that I never could have imagined. When I started out, I had no formal training in the manufacture of guitars, explained George.ldquoIn a way, that gave me the confidence to take some risks, innovate and produce an instrument that has a completely unique voicing.He found the Prince of Wales to be very interested in the guitarsrsquo manufacture and may have even suggested a new development.ldquoWe had a great chat and he asked quite a lot of questions about the wood, all kinds and how we found it, said George.ldquoHe was also very interested in dieback ash, asking aboutit would be a very good way to use the trees as a lot have perished due to this disease.ldquoIt wouldnrsquot be the best toned wood you could find but Irsquove been thinking more about that since and wondering whether we could use it for guitar necks or not so we might do a little experiment to seeit works.From creating coveted instruments for top Irish and UK guitarists in the know, Lowden Guitars have become an international sales success mdash hence the Queenrsquos Award.George explained: ldquoThe company is far bigger than I ever envisaged. In some ways itrsquos good but I never tried to expand the company and get the kind of growth we have enjoyed. It just kind of happened over the years as organic growth which has been great.His guitars tend to sell by word of mouth from musician to musician and the actual experience of playing a Lowden and relishing its distinct tones at first hand.ldquoWherever in the world where we sell, we are still quite a niche, upper end company so the guitars are at the highest price level in all of the countries, said George.ldquoItrsquos a natural process where people see the guitars for the first time. They go into a shop and then over a period of a few years the reputation builds within that country. Our presence also grows and then we move into more specialist guitar shops, so it all takes time.ldquoI remember as a teenager I was mad keen to get a Gibson  which I saw in Matchettrsquos shop window in Belfast all those years ago and I couldnrsquot afford it.ldquoIf something is really good, and the young player comes in and plays it but canrsquot afford it, it goes into his or her mind and later on they find a way to afford it.George says the Covid pandemic has not impact on sales, although it has had other consequences.George said: ldquoIt didnrsquot impact on us for sales as our order book remained very firm but it was more to do with making the guitars as we had to completely re-organise the factory for better social distancing which was very expensive.ldquoWe had to close down the factory for a while in order to do that and more with people having to isolate it proved challenging..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Magpies fly high in Breffni Park  ","story":"DOWN kingpins Kilcoo qualied for an Ulster semi-final after a good performance at Kingspan Breffni Park on Saturday evening, defeating Cavan-based Ramor United by  points.The Magpies, reigning Ulster champions, will meet Glen of Derry in the last four in what will be a massive clash in two weeks time.It was tit-for-tat early on but the home side got a massive confidence boost in the fth minute via a well taken Sean McEvoy goal, their most impressive performer on the night.Kilcoorsquos response was emphatic though, firstly Ceilum Doherty stuck over a nice point and then that man Jerome Johnston done what he does best and fired to the net to put his side into a lead they would never relinquish.Further scores from Ryan McEvoy, Shealan Johnston and Doherty again sent them in four up at the water-break.The second period of the first half turned out to be poor affair with both sides missing good scoring chances.

McCollam fired over another point in the th minute and pointed a free at the very end while trying to it in on the Downpatrick area to poach a late goal.McCloskey didnrsquot score in the second half and being out of general play resulted in his normally reliable free-taking also taking a hit.At the other end the outnumbered Downpatrick forwards had to survive on scraps as well but they could always rely on their free-takers.Goalkeeper Pearse Smyth landed two points from inside his own half, while Tom McGrattan converted three frees and landed a point from play as well.McGrattan was the star of the game and he capped a brilliant inidual performance with two late plays that effectively took his team into the final.With the game in the balance at - each in the rd minute, McGrattan jinked his way along the sideline under the stand to win himself a free.It was an acute angle, but the Portaferry clubman arrowed the sliotar between the uprights.Then less than a minute later he played a beautul cross-field pass into the path of mid-fielder Finn Turpin, who stepped inside the defender and hit the roof of the net from  metres out.St Patrickrsquos were through to their first ever Danske Bank Mageean Cup final where they will play St Patrickrsquos Maghera at the Dub Arena on Friday week, December .But back again to that breath-taking first half.After five minutes, the teams had each scored three points. By the tenth minute, Jack McCloskey had cut through the Red High cover and shot to the net off the base of the right hand post.Within three minutes Downpatrick were a point up. McGrattan went around the left side of the Ballymena defence at full pace to rle to the roof of the net for one of the best goals that you will see at any level.Aodhan McGarry responded by pointing from a side-line and the water-break broke the action at - each.McGarry started the second quarter scoring with a fine point but a run of three successive scores from Finn Turpin, McGrattan and Oisin Coulter edged the Red High ahead again.However, three frees from Jack McCloskey and a point from Ronan McCollam put Ballymena in the lead by - to - at half-time.By the second water break Downpatrick were - to - ahead, mainly through frees and St Louisrsquo were now looking for scores from distance.The next  minutes went scoreless. In hindsight Ballymena snatched at a couple of scoring chances that might have put pressure on the eventual winners who pumped a lot of ball in high on the north Antrim defence with no .Eventually sub Tom McFerran brought the teams level and McCollam from the left wing gave St Louisrsquo the lead. The gauntlet had been thrown down for the Red High.Oisin Coulter landed a much-needed Downpatrick point in reply and they held firm until Tom McGrattan delivered the match-winning scores.It is scant consolation for Ballymena that they played their part in a fine display of schoolsrsquo hurling, but a number of players stood out including Daire McMullan, Connor Dickson and Dara Martin in defence and McCollam and McCloskey in attack until tempered by Downpatrickrsquos packed back line.Defence was ultimately the winning of the game, but they would not have got across the line without Turpin, Oisin Coulter and especially the mercurial Tom McGrattan.As a hurling disciple of the great Bro Charles in the s, I was a proud man leaving the Dub on Friday evening.For the generations of hurlers who climbed to the top of the hill on Saul Street each morning over the past  or  years, winning a Mageean was just not on the radar.This team is only  minutes from achieving what for us was the impossible.St Patrickrsquos: P Smyth - frees, J Ruddy, R OrsquoNeill, D Coulter, S Mageean, D Mallon, C Lenaghan, T Connolly -, F Turpin -, M Dorrian -, A Connolly, T McGrattan - , O Coulter -, R McGrath, S McCarthy.Subs: F MacManus for A Connolly , LMcCabe for S McCarthy , F Casey for R McGrath ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Road officials set to carry out survey at Ballynahinch school  ","story":"PLANS by roads officials to carry out a survey on the main road outside Ballynahinch Primary School have been welcomed by Strangford MLA Peter Weir.The work will be carried out to assess the potential for a new pedestrian crossing and while pleased that the survey is to take place, Mr Weir is disappointed that there are no current plans to also introduce a temporary mph speed limit at the Dromore Road as part of a province-wide Department for Infrastructure initiative.Mr Weir mdash who has met with school principal Mr Michael Moore mdash said the safety of children who have to cross the busy road was of paramount importance and a real issue of concern for parents and residents.The former Education Minister said he was ldquodisappointed that the school had not been included in the Roads Departmentrsquos part-time mph speed limit scheme.ldquoI believe that the Department needs to give a clear commitment that Ballynahinch Primary School will be included in the next roll-out of the scheme, said Mr Weir.ldquoThe Dromore Road is busy and is also a bus route.

Good work by all three.Cross-countryThe Robinson brothers, Oliver and Alex, ended off their  cross-country season with a trip to the Uneven Age Group All Irelands Cross Country in Gowran, Kilkenny, on Sunday.The sun shone all day but the temperature stayed low with the ground remaining icy in parts. Alex had gained his Ulster U- team place by coming sixth at the Ulster  NI race in Donegal a few weeks previously, so he had set his expectations high.His race was ,m around a very twisty course through long grass, all of which made it more technical than previous races.The start of any cross-country race is hectic with lots of jostling and this was no exception.Alex was pulled back when the gun went off and then had to contend with some fallers so he never really got into his stride.He was disappointed to place th out of a field of  runners, but deserves huge credit for his commitment over the last few months.Alexrsquos older brother, Oliver, was running for the Down team in the U- race. He was probably one of the youngest in the -strong field, having celebrated his th birthday a few days beforehand, so had no expectations and therefore maybe put less pressure on himself.He had a great run in the end, taking one minute and  seconds off his previous road k personal best and completing the course in .. He finished th and was the second Down team member home.Both boys have done their club proud and their parents also deserve medals for acting as support crew on multiple weekends. They will all be glad of a rest before racing resumes in January.Dillon in KGavin Hynds, as a long term member of East Down AC, was delighted when his son, Dillon, decided to follow in his footsteps by signing up to the EDAC junior section.Dillon has been attending sessions since September and gaining confidence each week, so when his school, Our Lady and St Patrick Primary, announced a fundraiser k fun run and walk he felt that he might be fit to take part as a runner.On Saturday morning despite the horrible weather conditions, he set off to the RGU in Downpatrick with Gavin as his sidekick. K is a long way at Dillonrsquos age, but to give him his due he stuck at it and made it to the finish with a bit of encouragement from his dad.

In my opinion, such an appointment is crucial and could benefit the town and the business community a great deal.ldquoThe night time economy is one area that needs to be improved not only in Downpatrick but where, but rapid progress this in the current Covid climate may not be possible.ldquoHowever, there is no reason why ideas to regenerate our night time economy cannot be discussed now to lay plans for the future, he continued.Cllr Curran said every high street is dferent, with many people keen to see them become vibrant shopping hubs at the heart of local communities, explaining that the work of the Stormont task force could not be more timely.He added: ldquoAnything that can be done to increase footfall in our town centres in the future will be more than welcome.The call for evidence document is available at https:www.executiveoffice-ni.gov.uk consultations call-evidence-high-street-task-force, while responses to the call for evidence can be made to highstreet@communities-ni.gov.uk..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13291311.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Monaghan.DAERA officials have also confirmed, late last night, the presence of Avian Influenza in two wild birds retrieved from the Belfast Waterworks site earlier this week.Disease control zones have been put in place around all infected premises to mitigate against onward disease spread.Under the new housing measures, all bird keepers in NI will be legally required to keep their birds indoors or otherwise separate from wild birds, and to follow strict biosecurity measures.This applies to owners of pet birds, commercial flocks or just a few birds in a backyard or hobby flock.Announcing the decision to introduce a housing order, Minister Poots said: ldquoI took the decision to introduce the new housing measures in order to try to prevent an incursion of avian influenza into the poultry flock in Northern Ireland.ldquoIt is now a legal requirement for all poultry and captive bird keepers to keep their birds housed or otherwise separate from wild birds.ldquoThis decision was based on sound expert advice and in consultation with industry.ldquoThis decision to house is an additional step to the Avian Influenza Prevention Zoneintroduced on November , and is another necessary precautionary measure requiring all bird keepers to keep their birds housed.ldquoThese housing measures build on the strengthened biosecurity measures that were brought in as part of the AIPZ.ldquoSince my decision to introduce the housing order, we have now discovered avian flu in two wild birds in Belfast ndash that tells us unequivocally that the disease is already here and in our wild bird population.ldquoKeeping it out of the commercial flocks is now down to our poultry sector and the measures they take to keep the disease out.ldquoAdhering to, and a constant review of, all biosecurity measures is the best weapon we have to avoid an incursion.ldquoMy officials will continue to liaise closely with stakeholders and colleagues in GB and the Republic as the situation develops.To assist all bird keepers in complying with the new rules, a Biosecurity self-assessment tool has been developed that is available on the DAERA website.If avian influenza were to enter NI, the disease would have a signicant and devastating impact on our poultry industry, international trade and the wider economy.Poultry and captive bird keepers are advised to be vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds, and to seek prompt advice from their vetthey have any concerns.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Contributors include Lord Trimble, Graham Gudgin, Ray Bassett, Mike Nesbitt, Jeff Dudgeon and News Letter editor Ben Lowry. There is a foreword by Baroness Hoey. As of late , the book is available for £. through Blackstaff Press and Amazon Later concessions include the On-the-Runletters of comfort for hundreds of IRA volunteers an “amnesty” in relation to the use of forensic evidence on decommissioned weapons and the bodies of the disappeared Royal Prerogative of Mercy pardons prosecution indemnities for witnesses giving evidence at tribunals such as the Bloody Sunday enquiry and the lack of investigations into the people involved in the , bombings and , shootings of the Troubles which did not involve deaths.For some , people who were “only” injured there is to be no justice. Given the anticipated paucity of future prosecutions, except for Army veterans, we are already close to a full amnesty in all but name.Few dare to speak that name, or its iants: drawing a line, a statute of limitations, and putting the past behind us, as happened in both parts of Ireland in the s. But many of the politicians involved privately admit to wanting one. Influential public figures in Northern Ireland who have openly supported an amnesty or iants include influential Catholics and nationalists: John Larkin QC who as Attorney General proposed a stay on prosecutions former Assistant Chief Constable Peter Sheridan Dennis Bradley of the Consultative Group on the Past the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Barra McGrory. The former Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan called for further inquests to end after five years. Another notable advocate of an amnesty is Sir Desmond Rea, first chairman of the Northern Ireland Policing Board.Jeff Dudgeon is a human rights activist and former Ulster Unionist Party councillor, who has advised the party on legacyIn  Secretary of State Peter Hain introduced the Northern IrelandBill which provided for a “judicially based” amnesty for OTRs and others. The Conservative Shadow Secretary of State, David Lidington, called it “an amnesty in all but name” although Hain replied saying, “an amnesty is when you let people out”. The deal in the Bill had been agreed with Sinn Féin, but when it transpired that it might apply to members of the security forces it foundered. The OTRs had to await another, secret operation put together by Tony Blair and Gerry Adams, involving  “letters of comfort” notying IRA members that they were not wanted by the police for questioning. After the existence of these letters emerged during the trial of John Downey in , the Police Service of Northern Ireland revealed that  of those who received letters were suspects in  murder cases. The Commons’ Northern Ireland Affairs Committeeinvestigated the scheme and concluded that it had “distorted the process of justice”.After years of largely futile discussion, Northern Ireland’s political parties continued to disagree on how best to deal with the legacy of the Troubles. In an attempt to break the impasse, the Northern Ireland Officein March  proposed “a new independent body focused on providing information to families and swt examinations of all unresolved deaths from the Troubles an end to the cycle of reinvestigations that has failed victims and veterans for too long ensuring that Northern Ireland veterans receive equal treatment to their counterparts who served overseas.”The NIO tacked on a reconciliation aspect, but nobody will be reconciled by one-sided, victim-focused justice. The mantra of “truth, justice and reconciliation” is a  god. Impartial professional historians alone can retrieve whatever can be established of the truth, while lack of evidence for prosecutions means that formal justice for the , families whose relatives were killed is impossible.Throughout two decades of legacy recommendations, initiatives and proposed legislation, there has been an accelerating use of the courts to advance the republican narrative, assisted by legal aid. This development has come to be termed ‘lawfare’, and its potential for expansion is limitless. It may be better than warfare, but it is politically debilitating for Northern Ireland. One wing of government, however, is not wedded to normal constitutional stability. We are told the Belfast Agreement brought peace, which is a myth that needs examined. The war ended because the IRA chose to end it, seeing a more promising path. Their demand for ‘all-party talks now’ within a ‘peace process’ proved to be remarkably perceptive. That process is continuing, and in their view can end only with the demise of Northern Ireland. Unionism, in contrast, is about maintaining the status quo and minimising concessions. This is conservative territory which is generally unappealing to the young and woke.The courts, especially in Belfast, remain open to judicial reviews, demands for the re-opening of inquests, civil suits for damages, challenges on convictions, requests for new public inquiries, all alongside Police Ombudsmaninvestigations and Strasbourg cases. The value and cost of all this activity needs to be questioned, but it will take a brave government to put in place legislation to curb the lawfare industry.A civil war was averted in the  years from . No credit is given for that, certainly not to the security forces and their dead. Sadly, young people for the most part have little empathy for those families. Solidarity when shown is largely within the republican community who use law to achieve the ends once reserved to war.During the printing of The Idea of the Union in July, the NIO published a Command Paper “Addressing the Legacy of Northern Ireland’s Past” which proposes an end to pre- criminal investigations. This has appeased veterans in the short term but at the expense of a great deal of outrage from all sides. Without, as proposed, also closing down inquests, civil suits, private prosecutions and judicial reviews, a no-prosecutions policy will do little to reduce the hurt over unfairness, the clogging of the courts or the enormous cost. The basic problem will remain unless lawfare is limited. It can be done, but the NIO will have to steel itself, face down Strasbourg challenges and accept that to rule is to decide. There is no alternative coming from the local political parties.The proposed alternative “truth recovery” bodies have the potential to be as toxic as continued criminal investigationsthere are no cost caps or time limits. The notion of reconciliation is a dead letter evenregularly touted by the NIO. What is possible is a narrowing process. It appears to be under way and has to be supported so far as it goes.Without a grand settlement, which is unlikely given the political nature of the process, the legacy debate will grind on. Nationalist lawfare cannot lose as the legal iants still remain limitless. Non-nationalist lawfare, in so far as it exists, can call into question conventional legal wisdom on the requirements of the European Convention on Human Rights, but will London risk the wrath of Dublin and new legal challenges at Strasbourg On a more positive note, veterans have for the first time created a counterweight to the publicly-funded human rights industry.Agreement to dfer, putting the past behind us, is a better policy than well-funded politically-motivated archival archaeology supported by generously state-funded lawfare.• Taken from ‘The Idea of the Union: Great Britain and Northern Ireland’ edited by John Wilson Foster  William Beattie Smith.

Clockwise from top left, David Lloyd George Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, , Winston Churchill, Robert Barton, Michael Collins, Arthur GrfithLock it up carefully”, David Lloyd George said to his mistress and secretary, Frances Stevenson, in her room at  Downing Street, as he handed her the British copy of the historic Anglo-Irish Treaty just before  am on  December .Under its terms the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, as created by Pitt the Younger  years earlier, came to an end. Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPollsters Yougov surveyed a sample of people from Wales and the rest of Britain, asking them whether they would support or oppose banning people who have not been vaccinated against coronavirus from visiting public places.Such places would include events and non-essential shops, Yougov suggested.The poll comes as some countries attempt to ramp up vaccination rates by either threatening new restrictions or making jabs mandatory.Political leaders in the UK have downplayed the prospects of such restrictions being introduced, but other European nations have already begun taking steps to curb freedoms for unvaccinated citizens.The Yougov poll found that in the Wales and Midlands area, nearly two-thirds of peoplesaid they would either strongly support, or tend to support, banning unvaccinated people from non-essential public places.Just one in four peoplesaid they would oppose such restrictions on the unvaccinated.The regional results largely match the total response from Wales, England and Scotland, which showed  per cent would support a ban and  per cent would oppose it.MORE ON CORONAVIRUS:Yougov uses sampling data to measure public attitudes to current events and issues. In this case, some , people across Britain, including  in the Wales and Midlands region, responded to the survey. While the sample cannot give a  per cent accurate record of public opinion, it does provide a helpful indicator of which way the wind is blowing when it comes to any future Covid policies on vaccinations and restrictions.A few days ago, Germany announced it would be reimposing some restrictions across the nation, as well as bringing in tough new measures aimed specically at unvaccinated people..removeMany leisure and entertainment venues will only be accessible for people who have either been vaccinated or who have recently recovered from Covid, and the German parliament will also consider a general vaccine mandate which,passed, could come into force as soon as February next year.The nation follows neighbouring Austria, which last month brought in lockdown-style rules for people who have not been vaccinated. Around  per cent of people in Austria have been fully vaccinated ndash one of the lowest rates in western Europe.By comparison, some  per cent of people in the UK have been given both jabs, and booster vaccines have already been administered to . per cent of those people who are currently eligible.Asked on Fridayvaccines could ever be made mandatory for the general public in the UK, a spokesman for Downing Street told reporters: \"Wersquove set out our policy on this and wersquove said itrsquos not something that we would look to introduce.\"And earlier this week, Wales health minister Eluned Morgan said such rules were\"not something the Welsh Government has considered\".While health is devolved in Wales, policies regarding vaccines have remained largely the same across the four UK nations, led by common advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation .However, England has taken the additional step of making vaccines mandatory for health and social care workersndash a measure which hasnt been introduced here in Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Soon after they arrived in Belfast it is believed that Mr Lovell died from Black Flu and before he died, and about to be left alone, Mrs Lovell accepted compensation for the damage that the wagon had suffered in the sea crossing and gave up ownership.The vintage horse-drawn caravan has been lovingly restored.It was the custom at that time in some Romany communities that the do was burned when the owner died, hence making this type of caravan particularly rare. This wagon luckily escaped as it had passed out of Mr Lovell’s hands.In  it came into the ownership of Mr McNeill. He completely stripped down, repaired, and repainted the original wood and metal employing the skills of craftsmen such as signwriter   restorer Mark Stead and wheelwright Cecil Watson. Where replacement was necessary, he sourced only authentic materials. Whilst in the restoration process, a museum stated that they estimated therewere only five remaining in the United Kingdom.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.
