Meanwhile, Harry confirmed a rift with his brother William, the Duke of Cambridge, and told of how his father Prince Charles - the heir to the throne - had cut him off financially. And the couple, who were expecting their second child at the time, also revealed to Winfrey that they were expecting a girl.Their daughter, Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor, was born in California in June.She was given Queen Elizabeth\u0027s childhood nickname, sparking controversy over whether the royal couple had asked permission to recycle the head of the royal household\u0027s cherished moniker.Harry and Meghan also paid tribute to the Duke\u0027s late mother Diana, who was killed in a car crash in Paris in August 1997 aged 36.  "},{"url":null,"title":"Elon Musk Grimes split three years together","story":"Share this articleElon Musk and Grimes break up after three years togetherThe Life and Death of Grimes - WSJ"},{"url":null,"title":"Selfish drivers pack cars jerry cans tanks brim","story":"   The Prime Minister is expected to buckle and grant visas for thousands of foreign drivers in a bid to tackle the shortages, while soldiers will also be drafted in to help at HGV testing sites to clear a backlog of drivers trying to get licences. But Toby Ovens, managing director of Broughton Transport Solutions, said he is not convinced a temporary visa scheme will solve the current shortage of HGV drivers. Photographs show desperate motorists queuing for petrol at 5.45am this morning at Sainsbury\u0027s Alperton station as the hunt for fuel continued overnight.And one woman told MailOnline her 75-year-old husband missed his emergency A\u0026ampE hospital appointment this morning when they hit traffic queuing for Esso garage on Wood Street in Barnet, London. Dan Goldsmith, of Marine and Wildlife Rescue, told MailOnline his team couldn\u0027t help ill seal pups around the Norfolk coast because they were running out of fuel.He said: \u0027We have numerous seal pups that are sick around the Norfolk coast and currently outstanding, we just have no fuel locally and now we are below 30 mile range for our vehicle, we have had to suspend our service. This situation is frustrating and so unfortunate.\u0027 Britain is said to be short of more than 90,000 drivers, partly the result of coronavirus which cancelled the training and testing of tens of thousands of workers, and there are concerns an additional 5,000 may be too little, too late to halt the chaos.    Driver shortages are hitting every part of the economy, creating gaps on supermarket shelves, leaving pubs and restaurants short of key produce and jeopardising the supply of key chemicals to water firms.  The problems were triggered after BP and Esso admitted on Thursday that a lack of tanker drivers was hitting deliveries. The news led to a race to the petrol pumps with the result that hundreds ran out of some fuel types and dozens closed altogether.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps\u0027 appeal for drivers to \u0027carry on as normal\u0027 has been ignored, leading to long jams and angry scenes at filling stations.    Jackie Cohen’s husband Raymond missed his appointment on Saturday morning after queues completely blocked the road.

But I was able to get back in and finish the filming. And afterwards I felt elated.As anyone who has had a panic attack knows, the only upside of the nightmarish ‘am I actually going mad?’ midst of the attack itself is that once it subsides it can give way to an almost euphoric high.After that, panic attacks became regular visitors in my life. After a month or two of these episodes, it was my mother who diagnosed me. She said she’d read an article about panic attacks and thought that was probably what was going on with me.But what to do about it? The triggers seemed to be any situation I felt I couldn’t walk away from without being conspicuous.Tube carriages when the train suddenly stopped in a tunnel caused immediate panic. This paranoia increased the panic and I’d be sent spiralling into a shortness of breath, the craziness in my head and an inability to get a proper grasp on the passing of time.Other panic-inducing situations included things such as meetings with my record label, where we’d sit in a boardroom with the door shut.But the biggest and baddest of these situations was live TV.Eventually I thought to myself: Enough, I need to sort this out.The most popular route to help with panic attacks seemed to be hypnotherapy. This was the first therapy I’d ever tried – for anything – and I was a bit wary.The initial session – with a very well-meaning practitioner – did nothing for me. She put on calming music and told me to lie still and relax, which sent me straight into the beginnings of an attack.After that, a friend told me about someone who had been treated by the hypnotist Paul McKenna.He’d become a regular fixture on TV and claimed he could change your life. I wasn’t sure whether he could really help me but I got in touch and trotted along to his place in Kensington, West London.We spoke about the triggers of my anxiety and about other situations when I’d felt that way.He said to imagine that I was standing in a room, and in the corner there was a television with a black-and-white image on it. The image should be an image of me from when I first remembered feeling out of control.I thought back to when I was little and my mum and dad had split up, and all the fights over where I would spend the time, especially when there was an uneven number of nights to be shared.The image I saw was me standing there at around the age of six while my stepmum explained how Dad was feeling about not seeing me as much as he’d like to.While she spoke, I felt incredibly guilty and out of control.The pressure was too much and I didn’t want to hurt anyone or upset anyone. I simply didn’t know what to do.Paul listened and told me to get closer to the screen and then let the image turn from black-and-white to colour.‘Now step inside the image. Climb into the scene and speak to that little version of yourself. Tell her you’re now an adult, that it’s OK she didn’t know what to do, and that you’ve grown into a happy grown-up so she doesn’t need to worry. It’s all going to be OK, and you can tell her that.’I did what he said and shortly afterwards I walked out of Paul’s house in a daze.I had been completely awake and aware throughout the session, but boy, was it powerful. For the next two or three days I could remember so many details from the time I was around the age of six or seven – things I had long forgotten, sights and smells. It was bizarre, but it really worked.Since that time I’ve had the inklings of a panic attack – the occasional little tug – but never again has it bloomed into a full-blown thing. Whatever Paul said to me that day, in just one session, was incredibly effective in giving the power back to me. I’m so grateful to him. Especially amazing was the fact that he never charged me. He told me to make a contribution to charity, instead, which I did of course.Pretty cool, that.© Sophie Ellis-Bextor, 2021Abridged extract from Spinning Plates by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, published by Coronet on October 7 at £16.99.

Video: Kathleen Harris Dr John Dunbar with a noble false widow spider, steatoda nobilis. Although he has handled thousands, Dr Dunbar has never been bitten. Photograph: Photograph: Dara Mac DonaillWe should see plenty of action in an hour, Dr John Dunbar says assuredly via email, excited at the prospect. As a venom expert, many nights are spent combing the walls and railings of Dublin housing estates for Ireland’s highly-poisonous false widow spider.Alone in the dark, armed with extended tweezers and a headlamp, he carefully places each one inside long plastic tubes as the residents sleep inside, blissfully unaware.On a chilly evening thousands of such spiders are scattered just out of sight along Beech Park, a long quiet suburban road in Lucan lined with detached homes and webbed hedges. The noble false widow – or steatoda nobilis – first recorded in Ireland in 1999 is far more common than most people realise and its numbers are increasing alarmingly.Within two minutes Dr Dunbar is poking at a web string. He has spotted two long, thin protruding legs, inconspicuous to the passerby. It is the first trophy of 94 that night.Although he has handled thousands, Dr Dunbar has never been bitten. Twenty bites have been recorded in Ireland, he declares, and the bite is one to be avoided.In some cases victims have experienced severe bacterial infections, debilitating pain and body tremors.Steatoda nobilis is compared to the notorious black widow for a number of reasons including notable similarities in appearance, genetics and toxins. It is known as the “false widow” because in regions where they co-exist it can be difficult to tell them apart.Smaller than the native house spider, chocolate brown with a large bulbous abdomen and an intricate cream pattern sometimes resembling a skull, the false widow is easy to identify.Five or six years ago researchers would have had to look hard for one. Today, a single hunter can expect to bag between 100 and 150 in a few hours in any suburban estate.Thought to have originated in the Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and the Canaries, it arrived in the United Kingdom and Europe on banana boats. Throughout the 20th century it established thriving populations throughout England and Wales, and later colonised parts of western Europe, California, Chile and the Middle East.Although found in Co Wicklow a little more than two decades ago, little was known about its presence here until more recently. A 2017 Royal Irish Academy study confirmed the species in at least 16 counties, but most significantly in the greater Dublin area where it is abundant in urban buildings and around street furniture.As Dr Dunbar walks slowly from suburban home to home, he identifies and scoops up the spiders from virtually every single driveway pillar he examines. His head torch illuminates the undersides of wall ledges, shrubs, gates, guttering, the back of ESB boxes. They are everywhere. After just a short while it seems other native species are relatively difficult to come by.Potent venom“But they do have a venom that’s a little bit more potent than what we’re used to. It’s very similar to the venom of black widows, not quite as potent, but still kind of getting there.”The risk posed are similar to ones posed by bees and wasps. Each spider can give about half of one microlitre of venom, about one thousandth of a millilitre. On his regular hunts Dr Dunbar tells the gardaí he will be prowling. The glow from his headlamp and his intricate inspection of neighbourhood walls are common, as are encounters with neighbours.Just as he is plucking a sample with his extended tweezers, a resident approaches with a fair idea of what is going on but curious all the same. “They are obviously everywhere in this area,” Colm Gallagher says resignedly. “I know what the implications are they have venom and whatever else. But they’re not terribly dangerous.”They do go inside houses, but not usually. Whether for the curious resident, the arachnophobe or the scientist, there is still a lot to learn about these creatures and a race to learn it.“They are here to stay, there is no way we’re going to get rid of them,” he says. “But we really need to monitor them while we can over the next years and see what happens. Now science must tell us what we are dealing with,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Price volatility should prompt accelerated deployment of solar PV, says energy groupEurope awakens to cold reality of what happens when wind fails to blow for long periodsWhat\u0026rsquos happening when it comes to climate change, what are the targets and why do we need to up our game?"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Earlier leaf-fall, even of days, could reduce carbon stored by forestsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 vaccine tracker how many people have been inoculated in ireland","story":"It has been over a year since the first case of Covid-19 was confirmed in the Republic of Ireland. Since then, over 300,000 people have been diagnosed in the State, and over 5,000 people have died.Globally, over 200 million people have been diagnosed and over 4\u0026nbspmillion have died since the virus was first identified in China in December 2019.Four of these have been authorised for use in the EU - one from AstraZeneca, one from BioNTech-Pfizer, one from Moderna and another from Johnson \u0026amp Johnson (Janssen).The EU has put in place purchase agreements with Sanofi-GSK\u0026nbspand Curevac, and\u0026nbsphas concluded exploratory talks with two other vaccine producers - Novavax and Valneva.Ireland, along with all other EU member states, will get a proportional amount of every vaccine that is approved for use by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) according to its population.But how do these other vaccines work, and when will they be approved for use here? Have there been any reported side effects? And when can you expect to receive a vaccine?The  Vaccine Tracker will be updated daily as the country embarks on the largest inoculation programme in the history of the State.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 70°C.EMA approval: Granted on December 21st.Overview: Developed by New York-based Pfizer and German company BioNTech this vaccine has a brand name of Comirnaty. It uses messenger RNA (mRNA) technology, which has instructions for producing a protein from Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The person’s immune system recognises this protein as foreign and produces antibodies and activates T-cells (white blood cells) to attack it, giving them immunity. The vaccine will last for six months when stored at -70C, and five days when stored at between 2 and 8 degrees Celsius. The EU has approved the withdrawal of six doses from each vial.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, headache, muscle and joint pain, chills and fever. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 546,000 in April, 738,000 in May and\u0026nbsp844,000 doses in June, with 5.4 million doses in total expected by the end of 2021.Storage: Must be kept in a freezer at - 20°C.EMA approval: Granted on January 6th.Overview: Developed by Boston-based company Moderna, this vaccine is manufactured for EU states at partner plants in Switzerland, France and Spain before being distributed across the continent. Like the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine, it uses mRNA technology to produce a Sars-CoV-2 protein, which the body then attacks to give immunity. It will last for up to six months when stored at - 20°C. The first Moderna vaccine was given in Ireland on January 16th.Side effects: Common side effects (occurring in more than 1 in 10 people) included pain and swelling at the injection site, tiredness, chills, fever, swollen or tender lymph nodes under the arm, headache, muscle and joint pain, nausea and vomiting. Less common was redness, hives and rash at the injection site. Severe allergic reactions occurred in a very small number of cases.How many will Ireland get? 383,000 by June and 870,000 doses by the end of 2021.How many have been vaccinated here?Dose: Two doses, between 4 and 12 weeks apartEMA approval: Granted on January 29th.Overview: The OxfordAstraZeneca vaccine (also known as Vaxzevria) was thought of as a potential game-changer because it can be transported and stored at 2 degrees to 8 degrees for up to six months, making it much easier to move around and administer. It is also much cheaper, costing about $3-4 per shot, compared with $20 for the PfizerBioNTech jab, with the former being made on a not-for-profit basis for the duration of the pandemic.It is based on a harmless chimp cold virus that cannot grow inside human cells. Scientists have tweaked this virus so that it carries genetic material containing the instructions for a protein of the coronavirus. Once the vaccine has been administered, our bodies produce the coronavirus protein, triggering an immune response.During the trial, a dosing error led to the serendipitous finding that when clinical trial participants were given half a dose followed by a full dose, the vaccine had a higher efficacy than when participants were given two full doses, with 90 per cent efficacy in the former case and 62 per cent efficacy in the latter. This led AstraZeneca to announce in November a new global trial of the vaccine with the half dosefull dose regime.In January, a bitter row broke out between the European Union and AstraZeneca after the pharmaceutical company drastically revised downwards the number of doses it could deliver the bloc.\u0026nbspWhile the EMA approved the use of this vaccine for all ages, doubt was cast over its efficacy in the over 65s due to the lack of data from Astrazeneca’s clinical trials in this cohort. As a result, Germany, Austria, Sweden, Poland and Belgium have opted not to approve this product for their older population.Following suit, Ireland has also decided to use the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine for the over 70s where possible, not the AstraZeneca jab.It would not be the first time this jab led to a\u0026nbspsignificant reorganisation of our vaccination plans.Reports of serious blood clots, mostly in women aged under 60, led the\u0026nbspNational Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) to first defer the use of the vaccine on March 14th, before resuming it\u0027s use on March 20th.However, on April 12th, Niac\u0026nbsprecommended that AstraZeneca should not be given to people aged under 60, once again leading to a reorganisation of the rollout. This was revised to people aged over 50 on April 27th. On June 28th, Niac revised its advice again and said the vaccine could be given\u0026nbspto people aged under 40, although the mRNA shots were preferable for that age group.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbspLatest projections are 224,000 in April, 262,000 in May and 327,000 in JuneStorage: Lasts for up to two years frozen at –20° C, and up to three months refrigerated at 2-8° C.EMA approval: Approved on March 11th.Overview: The EMA started a rolling review of this single dose vaccine from Janssen, the Belgium-based subsidiary of Johnson \u0026amp Johnson on December 1st.On January 29th the company announced the results of its Phase 3 trial: the vaccine had an efficacy of 72 per cent in the United States, 66 per cent in Latin America, and 57 per cent in South Africa.This vaccine uses double-stranded DNA to deliver a protein from the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the body, thereby creating immunity. It is different from others on the market in that it requires just one injection. The EU has agreed an initial contract for 200 million doses, with an option to buy 200 million more.On February 16th the company applied to the EMA for\u0026nbspseeking authorisation for its single-dose vaccine, and it was approved on March 11th.However, on April 13th the company paused deliveries of its vaccine in Europe pending an investigation of rare blood clot cases that have halted its rollout in the US. The blood clotting conditions reported in recipients of the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine in the US are the same rare condition linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.On April 20th, the EMA\u0027s review of these issues found a possible link to very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets, and agreed a warning should be included in the product information.\u0026nbspHowever, it concluded\u0026nbspthe overall benefits of the vaccine\u0026nbspin preventing Covid-19 outweigh the risks of side effects, and so Janssen announced it would resume deliveries to the EU. In Ireland,\u0026nbspNiac initially recommended that the jab be used only for people over the age of 50, but this was revised to include the under 40s on June 28th. Those aged 18-34 can apply to get the Janssen vaccine at pharmacies around the country.How many will Ireland get?\u0026nbsp2.2 million doses in total,\u0026nbsp600,000 between April and June.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: US company Novavax has developed a Covid-19 vaccine which stimulates an immune response by delivering spike proteins into the body. These spike-proteins are grown and harvested from insects. Similar technology is used in the production of vaccines for influenza and HPV. The European Commission has concluded exploratory talks with Novavax with a view to purchasing up to 200 million doses. The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 3rd.Overview: In September the EU signed a deal to purchase 300 million doses of this vaccine. It is based on the same technology as one of Sanofi’s seasonal influenza vaccines - more conventional than the mRNA used by Pfizer and Moderna - and it was thought it could play a big role in ending the pandemic. However, despite positive results from Phase 1 trials, news came in December that Phase 2 trial results showed an insufficient immune response in older adults. Phase III studies were expected to start in December, but the companies now plan to begin a phase 2b study in February with a different formulation of the vaccine. Even if their new formulation is successful, they do not expect the vaccine to be available until the end of 2021.Storage: Will last for at least 3 months at 2-8°C.Overview: The German company CureVac began its final Phase 3 trials in December, with results expected in the first quarter of 2021. It uses the same mRNA technology as the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines, but can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures. The company has signed a deal with the EU to supply 405 million doses, pending regulatory approval.The EMA began a rolling review of the vaccine on February 12th.Storage: Stable at 2°C to 8°C.Overview: Valneva is a French company which has created a Covid-19 vaccine based on their Japanese encephalitis vaccine. It delivers a chemically inactivated coronavirus and uses an adjuvant (immunity booster) to create immunity. It entered clinical trials in December and reported positive results from these initial phase 1 and 2 trial in\u0026nbspApril 2021, while announcing it was entering\u0026nbspphase 3 trials on 4,000 people.On January 12th the European Commission concluded exploratory talks with the company for the supply of 30 million doses, with the option to buy a further 30 million.When might you be vaccinated?Over 80 per cent\u0026nbspof people in Ireland aged over 18 are now fully vaccinated, with over 90 per cent in receipt of at least one dose.

However, he also said the low level of vaccinations in developing countries would have to be taken into account as part of any consideration of the issue. His remarks come after Pfizer and BioNTech said their Covid-19 vaccine was safe for use for children aged 5 to 11. There was said to be strong antibody responses in a large-scale trial, findings that could pave the way to begin vaccinating primary school children within months. Pfizer and BioNTech said they plan to submit the data as part of a near-term request for an emergency-use authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration, and to share it with regulators in Europe as well.The United States could be using the vaccine for children aged between 5 and 11 as early as the end of October. For use with this age group in Ireland it would have to be approved by the European Medicines agency and the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC). He said: “Public health will have to weigh up the benefits for the child in respect of receiving the vaccine, as opposed to the risks to the child. Mr Martin added: “We vaccinate children in a whole range of other areas. “So, I’m of the view in terms of the advance of humankind, that vaccines overall have been extremely effective historically, in dealing with many, many virus and issues, but it remains to be seen in terms of the risk assessment”. Asked about the potential for the US to begin vaccinating children in this age group as early as next month Mr Martin replied: “Every context is different”. He said people he met during his trip to New York could not believe Ireland’s population over the age of 16 is 90 per cent vaccinated. Mr Martin added: “In many parts of the United States, they are at 50 per cent in some states, less in others.” “So all frontline healthcare workers, for example, in less developed regions should now get priority and we have to really up the level of vaccination in less developed regions. “So these are considerations we will have to seriously take on board as a country because the mutations will grow, variants will arise if we’ve whole parts of the world not vaccinated.”"},{"url":null,"title":"germany votes the election that could change europe s future","story":"Chancellor candidates Olaf Scholz of the Social Democrats, Annalena Baerbock of the Greens and Armin Laschet of the CDUCSU before a television debate last week.There’s a chill in the air of Berlin’s government quarter. Hints of red and yellow speckle the trees between the modernist chancellery and the historic Reichstag parliament, reminding me of the wistful urgency of Kurt Weill’s September Song.\u0026nbsp“When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flameI haven’t got time for the waiting game.”Jakob Heinze is tired of Germany’s waiting game on climate – and he’s tired from the hunger strike he began on August 30th.With half a dozen friends, he set up camp between parliament and the River Spree, starving in public as representatives of the “Last Generation” who can avoid irreversible climate change.Heinze, a 27-year-old campaigner with a bushy beard and tired eyes, says none of the main political programmes are ambitious enough to limit the 1.5 degree temperature rise required to avoid climate disaster – an analysis confirmed last week by a leading German economic think tank.If Europe’s largest country falls short, Heinze fears, the continent and the world will fail too.“I see hunger strike as the last means of civil disobedience, to make clear the disastrous situation in which we find ourselves, that soon there will be nowhere to hide,” said Heinze from a chair in front of his tent on Tuesday.The “Last Generation” camp had largely been wound up by the time huge crowds streamed through Berlin on Friday for Germany’s largest climate strike, lead this time by Sweden’s Fridays for Future founder, Greta Thunberg.\u0026nbspGermany is the sixth-largest emitter of carbon dioxide but, she said, its politicians were “duping” their voters, refusing to “treat the climate crisis as an emergency, not even after the terrible flood tragedy in the summer”.When 60.4 million Germans are called to the polls tomorrow, the election result has the potential to change Europe’s future – for better or worse.If you believe what Germans tell polling agencies, climate concerns are uppermost in voters’ minds as they head to the ballot box. Scratch beneath the surface, though, and the readiness for change evaporates amid cost and comfort concerns. Yes to green politics, no to more expensive petrol – and has anyone seen my SUV keys?That is cold comfort for locals in the southwestern state of Rhineland-Palatinate where, last July, the worst floods in the region for centuries washed away homes, businesses and left at least 183 dead. As the clear-up work continues, many towns here don’t even have lampposts to hang election posters from. Local Green Party candidate Martin Schmitt says the big climate question is secondary next to practical, every-day survival worries: electricity, water, heat for the winter.“At the moment, people’s shock is still so great that the federal election seems to be something from another planet,” he says.One hour north, in the pretty village of Keyenberg, locals are also fighting the loss of their homes. Not to flood waters but to local energy giant RWE. In a controversial deal with the state government of North Rhine-Westphalia, RWE has been granted permission to strip-mine the region and extract the Braunkohl – lignite – that lies beneath.Keyenberg, first mentioned 1,128 years ago, is one of five villages in this western region earmarked for destruction – and this although Germany has vowed to exit fossil fuels by 2038 at the latest.David Dresen grew up in Keyenberg, moved back here after studying in Bonn and expected to take over the family farm. While many neighbours have sold out to RWE and moved away, he is fighting to stay.“It makes no sense to me that today, in the 21st century, people should have to leave their homes to dig up lignite, which we know will ruin our future,” said the 29-year-old.Like most villagers, Dresen’s fury is directed at Armin Laschet, the state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia and the man hoping to retain the chancellery on Sunday for Germany’s centre-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU).“It is hypocritical for Armin Laschet to speak out for climate protection while being responsible for us losing our homes to lignite,” he says. “Germany has a reputation of being a leader on climate but the opposite is the case. People say they want climate protection but they prefer others – like us – to pay the price.”In an ironic footnote, he says that families left homeless by the July floods have now been housed in buildings awaiting demolition in Keyenberg. Today’s climate change victims in Germany live next door to tomorrow’s. At the end of the Merkel era, Germany’s unresolved climate struggle is inextricably linked with its unresolved energy dilemma.Along with coal, lignite – one of the dirtiest fuels known to man – contributes one quarter of Germany’s energy mix for homes, transport and heavy industry. Energy – and climate – pressures will increase still further next year, when – according to Chancellor Merkel’s post-Fukushima timetable – the last of Germany’s nuclear plants have to go off the grid.At her final press conference with journalists, days after the July floods, the chancellor insisted that she had “invested a lot of energy” in climate protection but, pressed by journalists, conceded that “not enough had happened” in her four terms.Last April Germany’s constitutional court agreed: it struck down her government’s climate plan for its lack of ambition, said it endangered the future of younger generations and forced a rushed rewrite.\u0026nbspDr Claudia Kemfert, energy expert at Berlin’s DIW economic institute, says the chancellor never pushed back energetically against Germany’s powerful energy and automative lobby.“Angela Merkel, as a former environment minister, started out as climate chancellor but unfortunately implemented too little of what would have been necessary from a climate protection perspective,” said Dr Kemfert. “The flood disaster at the very end of her chancellorship is symbolic: a result of unchecked climate change, for which Germany is partly responsible, is hitting Germany with full force.”No one expected much from Merkel when she scraped into power in 2005 – not even her own party – and certainly no one expected her to last 16 years. As chancellor, like a contestant in a demonic game show, she has faced an exhausting conveyor belt of crises: banking, euro, Ukraine, refugees, Covid-19. Through it all, Merkel remained a constant, consensus-seeking centre of calm. On the global political stage she proved that decency still matters, competence beats machismo, and modesty trumps Trump.Thanks to her herculean efforts, Europe’s centre has held. The question of Germany’s election, though, is: at what price? A clue lies in a 1991 television interview with a young Merkel that turned up recently online. In it, Helmut Kohl’s new family minister said she had a “longing for the possible” and preferred political compromises – but agreed that too many compromises bring a “risk of losing one’s truthfulness”.She returned to the theme recently, telling a leading German scientist how, early on as chancellor, she “made a fundamental decision to give all I can – but no more”.For good or ill, Merkelism is the perfection of politics as the art of the possible. The chancellor lifted the country out of economic decline, partly due to others’ reforms, largely insulated the country from the last decade’s shocks and made Germany the continent’s indispensable player.Her skill at compromise and will for European unity – most recently on joint EU deals on vaccine procurement and a joint recovery fund – means most Europeans, in a recent poll by the ECFR think tank, see Berlin as an integrating force and a trustworthy, pro-European power.But the downside of Merkelism – as France’s mercurial president Emmanuel Macron can attest – has been the Berlin-based drag on how Europe addresses growing challenges on the climate or global security.“Many of the most pressing challenges Europe faces\u0026nbspare impossible to address with the Merkel method,” the ECFR argued. “The EU will need a more visionary and courageous Germany to strengthen its foundations and defend its place in the world, many Europeans seem ready to accept this shift – and may even be waiting for Berlin to initiate it.”The key question – one that the three main chancellery candidates managed to avoid over three television debates – is whether Germany’s next government is prepared to make that leap.They are more likely to be preoccupied by Germany’s domestic reform building sites – climate change, energy transformation, dilapidated analogue and digital infrastructure, a pension time-bomb and more. The winner on Sunday may be the politician who promises voters a minimum of change at the least personal effort or cost.Germans crave stability and rewarded Merkel with four terms in office, where she perfected the art of making political omelettes without breaking any eggs. But her legacy of small-step politics – maximum consensus, minimum progress – remains palpable in German democracy, even if she is no longer on Sunday’s ballot.“This kind of democracy does not offer what is most necessary in these times of great transformation: an honest policy of demanding policies to take on the battle against crises, and maybe even to win,” argued Die Zeit weekly.Germany’s Greens took an early lead in polls with an ambitious plan: no more fossil fuels or permits for traditional cars by the end of the decade – rather than 2038 as agreed. Lead candidate Annalena Baerbock insisted Germany could become a world leader in industrial climate transformation technology – then sell its know-how to others.“The markets of the future are climate neutral,” she argued.But the Greens lost their poll lead after a series of gaffes, and when the personal cost of climate change became apparent. The CDU rose in polls with its new leader Armin Laschet. His confidence, some would say arrogance, that Merkel’s chancellery keys were his for the taking was dented in July when cameras spotted him laughing in a flood-wrecked town. Those images catalysed many voters’ doubts that this regional leader had the gravitas for the big stage in Berlin.His election pitch – tax cuts for the rich and dire warnings if Germany elected a leftist, non-CDU coalition – has struggled to catch the public mood.That honour goes to the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) and its candidate Olaf Scholz. He has pitched himself as the continuity-but-change candidate with an election narrative and to-do list that his party says mixes realism with respect: tax hikes for top earners and measured climate measures that help, rather than overwhelm, business and lower incomes.With his party’s poll lead tightening this week, he warned voters in Nuremberg that Germany needs to shake off its Merkel-era “complacency” and do more: on research, investment and climate change.For young Germans like Jakob Heinze, resorting to hunger strike in Berlin, or David Dresen in his endangered home in Keyenberg, this is the issue at the heart of Sunday’s election. Can Germany shake off late Merkel-era mildew and embrace change as an opportunity – rather than a threat?“The Merkel government’s framing of the last years has always been, ‘we need change but too much or too fast is bad and expensive and you don’t want that’,” says Dresen. “That’s the big business lobby talking. I hope there are enough voters who realise that it’s only with change – well-managed change – that we will get through.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"britains navy could expand canadian arctic support allies","story":"The Royal Navy could expand into the Canadian Arctic in a bid to contain strategic rivals Russia and China.General Sir Nick Carter, the Chief of the Defence Staff, said the UK was “keen to cooperate” with Canada in learning how to fight in the cold, in monitoring melting ice, and in “helping Canada do what Canada needs to do as an Arctic country”.His comments come in the wake of the Aukus pact under which the US and UK will provide nuclear-powered submarine technology to Australia.Heightened British involvement in the Arctic would be seen as a way to beef up Nato’s countering of Russia, and China, in the region. It would further the UK’s aims of post-Brexit realignment under a new Global Britain foreign policy.The Arctic is seen as an increasing strategic priority as climate change opens up shipping routes and valuable natural resources.In March, the Kremlin released a video of three of its submarines breaking through five feet of ice to surface within 1,000ft of each other, and it has been modernising Cold War-era bases.There is as yet no firm commitment, but there is some concern in Canada about its omission from the Aukus pact as it watches three of its closest allies deepening their ties.Speaking to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Sir Nick said: “I think we have military capabilities, certainly in the maritime domain and in terms of our science that would be useful to Canada, and I think operating alongside Canada in that regard is clearly going to be good for both countries.”He was speaking before the Aukus deal was made public.Canada currently has only diesel-electric submarines, bought from the UK in the 1990s, which cannot operate for long periods under the Arctic ice.A report this week by the Macdonald-Laurier Institute said Canada’s ability to control its vast maritime domain will be tested in the coming years and “serious questions remain” over whether it will have replacement submarines ready when needed, between 2036 and 2042.Britain has a training base in Suffield, southern Alberta, but it is over 1,000 miles south of the Arctic Circle.In the past, Canada has been hesitant to accept too much help in the Arctic due to disputes about its own sovereignty in the region, according to allies.Earlier this year, Norway cancelled a series of cold weather exercises involving thousands of international troops, including from the US and UK, due to the pandemic.The withdrawal from Afghanistan may also contribute to a refocusing on winter warfare for British forces.Military analysts believe the Arctic is a region where a small British contribution could have an outsized impact.The Arctic is believed to hold up to one quarter of the Earth’s undiscovered oil and gas.Russian President Vladimir Putin has put the potential value of Arctic minerals at $30 trillion and is seeking to assert influence over wide areas of the region.Russia’s Nagurskoye air base in the Arctic, which during the Cold War was little more than a communications outpost, has had its runway extended to accept all types of aircraft including nuclear-capable strategic bombers.A UK Ministry of Defence spokesman said: “Canada is one of the UK’s oldest and closest allies. We work together to address security challenges around the world, including through Nato and the Five Eyes partnership.“The UK will continue to work with all our allies, including Canada, on countering shared threats to our security.”More from NewsMother dies while waiting on phone for GP appointmentBoris Johnson demands pay rise for lorry driversDuke and Duchess of Sussex hit out at \u0026#39ultra-wealthy pharmaceutical companies\u0026#39The energy price cap is a sledgehammer imposed to limit market freedomDon\u0026#39t fail the next generation on homes, Robert Jenrick warnsLabour angers unionists with ‘the north of Ireland’ provocationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"colonialism complex woke historians would have believe","story":"I have sympathy for Kemi Badenoch, the equalities minister lambasted this week after a leaked message revealed that she once claimed not to “care about colonialism”.The woke view is that anything that can be labelled as ‘colonialism’ is inherently bad. But what is colonialism? Its critics never define the term, though they evidently mean European empires established across the world since the fifteenth century, beginning with the Portuguese and the Spaniards, continuing with the Dutch and the English (the worst malefactors, in their view), and including surprising imitators such as Latvian peasants settling in Tobago.Yet each of these episodes of colonisation had a distinctive character. The Portuguese long concentrated on creating trading stations – the last one, Macau, was only abandoned in 1999. Spain concentrated on land empires not just in vast swathes of the Americas but in the Philippines, Italy and the Netherlands, so that there was enormous variety within this vast assortment of territories.Woke historians love to deploy -isms: not just colonialism but imperialism, racism, capitalism, all said to be part of a single mind-set. The assumption is that these -isms were all of European creation and hark back to Columbus’s voyages to the Americas – not that the literally misguided admiral intended to get there. His aim was to establish trading stations in China, not start an empire building mission in Mexico and Peru.At any rate, the Aztecs and Incas were themselves conquerors who subjugated other peoples and exploited their labour. The Aztecs sacrificed huge numbers of war captives. We can add to the list of empires the Ottoman Turks, who conquered south-eastern Europe and the Middle East, and made heavy demands such as forced conscription. But they also lowered taxes, reined in local warlords, and protected ethnic and religious minorities. The balance sheet of empire is not all red. British rule brought tea plantations (and railways to transport the tea) to the uplands of India and introduced rubber plantations to Malaya all this provided work, though often in menial conditions that cannot be ignored either.Kemi Badenoch is right to mention African empires. In the fourteenth century Mansa Musa, king of Mali, was reputed to be the richest person on the planet, and was said to tether his horse to a pillar of gold. Later, rivalries among African rulers fuelled the slave trade once the Portuguese discovered that it was easier to buy war captives from African kings than to find the sources of Musa’s gold.Empires were not all created as the result of a grand master-plan organised by white male Europeans. The historian Sir John Seeley opined that the British Empire was acquired ‘in a fit of absence of mind’. Cromwell never intended to capture Spanish Jamaica. The East India Company, not the British government, laid the higgledy-piggledy foundations of British India. Kemi Badenoch is right that it is time to stop generalising about ‘colonialism’ and to recognise the complexity of the past.More from NewsMother dies while waiting on phone for GP appointmentBoris Johnson demands pay rise for lorry driversDuke and Duchess of Sussex hit out at \u0026#39ultra-wealthy pharmaceutical companies\u0026#39The energy price cap is a sledgehammer imposed to limit market freedomDon\u0026#39t fail the next generation on homes, Robert Jenrick warnsLabour angers unionists with ‘the north of Ireland’ provocationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"deep president biden knows usuk trade deal makes perfect sense","story":"Argentina’s invasion of the Falklands was a massive headache for the Reagan administration. While Britain was America’s foremost Nato ally, Galtieri’s junta was seen as a bulwark against communism, and the Organisation of American States was backing Argentina’s claim. The State Department’s instinct was to broker a compromise between the two belligerents.The US Senate, by contrast, was in no doubt about where it stood. A motion calling for an immediate Argentine withdrawal passed with only a single dissenting vote (that of the lifelong contrarian Jesse Helms).The Senator who proposed it was Delaware’s Joe Biden who, strange to think, had by then already held office for nearly a decade. “My resolution clearly calls for us to state whose side we’re on, which is the British side,” he told CBC. The United States, he added, should leave no one in any doubt that she was “standing with our closest and oldest ally and the alliance that is most important to America”.I have never bought the idea that Biden’s indomitable Irishry makes him anti-British. Sure, some Irish-American politicians (though hardly any Irish politicians, these days) feel that the one stance must imply the other, but Biden is not among them. Even when, under Bill Clinton, he horrified American security officials by lobbying to get Gerry Adams an American visa, he was not hostile to the UK. His first phone call as president was to Boris Johnson, and his first overseas visit was to Britain. He has stood resolutely by the Aukus pact, brushing off European criticism.Why, then, is he in no hurry to sign a trade deal with us? For the most basic reason of all: he is in no hurry to sign trade deals with anyone. Donald Trump’s malign ascendancy moved the dial on international commerce. Politicians in both parties started repeating his claptrap, partly from conviction but mainly from electoral calculation. All sorts of nonsensical ideas – ideas that had been definitively disproved by Adam Smith two-and-a-half centuries earlier – came back into circulation. The idea, for example, that a trade deficit undermines a nation’s long-term prosperity (there is no correlation) the idea that trading with low-wage economies destroys jobs (it may shift a few low-paid jobs, but it creates many more high-paid ones) the idea that governments should “protect” key industries (doing so invariably makes them flabby and inefficient – as Ronald Reagan used to say “protectionism” should really be called “destructionism”).America’s illiberal drift was accelerated by Covid which, illogically but inexorably, made people warier and more introverted. In the run-up to the 2020 elections, Republican candidates were looking over their shoulders at Trumpy primary voters, and Democrats were looking over theirs at anxious trade unions.Joe Biden didn’t survive half a century in front-line politics without knowing how to respond to the public mood. “As President”, announced the man who had sought Atlantic and Pacific trade deals under Obama, “I will not enter into any new trade agreements until we have invested in Americans and equipped them to succeed in the global economy”.In the short term, at least, Britain has missed her moment. We wasted the first three years after the Brexit vote with an idiotic internal debate about whether we wanted an independent trade policy at all. Then, just when we decided that we did, in smashed the wrecking ball of the coronavirus.That does not mean, though, that there is no progress to be made. What, after all, is a trade deal? It is not, as commentators sometimes seem to imply, a kind of permit that allows countries to sell to each other. Rather, it is a framework that pulls down identified obstacles and prevents the installation of new ones – or at least provides mechanisms for redress if they are erected.We are not seeking to establish some wholly new relationship with America, as if we were Elizabethan emissaries approaching Muscovy or Cathay. Rather, we want to scrap outstanding restrictions.Much can happen through sectoral deals. In recent months, officials have persuaded the US to drop its bans on British beef and lamb – the second being potentially hugely significant in a country that is just starting to acquire a taste for the stuff. They have defused the Boeing-Airbus dispute that had thrown up pointless and vexatious tariffs on products ranging from Highland knitwear to whisky. All this has gone hand-in-hand with arrangements between trade bodies.When Liam Fox began scoping the trade talks, he privately argued that a series of mini-deals might be the easier way forward, precisely because it would avoid a big set-piece that would bring out the worst tendencies on both sides (American mercantilists have their British equivalents in those resentful Remainers who are suddenly pretending to be alarmed about American steak).There is something in Fox’s analysis, but the underlying logic continues to pull towards a comprehensive deal that will provide a framework within which technologies and products yet unborn can circulate unhindered. Consider that each country is the other’s largest investor. A million Americans work for British-owned companies, and a million Brits work for American-owned companies. That mutual ownership rests on obvious congruities of language, commercial law, business etiquette, accountancy systems and culture.These same congruities ought to make the two countries natural trading partners – and would have decades ago had it not been for EU protectionism in agriculture and heavy industry. Similar wage levels and interoperable professional bodies make the mutual recognition of qualifications relatively straightforward. The few tariffs that remain on manufactured goods (notably cars) could easily be swept away.Britain wants greater access for its financial services firms, the US for its farmers. The first is more economically significant, the second politically tougher. But let’s not make the mercantilist error of seeing imports as a concession. Allowing British financial services to compete freely in all 50 states will chiefly benefit American consumers. Letting US beef appear on our shelves will chiefly benefit British consumers.The immediate consequence of Biden’s reluctance to go for a full-fledged FTA is to make it easier for Britain to repudiate the Northern Ireland Protocol. The main argument against unilateral abrogation was that it would hamper trade talks. But with a deal some years off, we should act now, show the world that a new arrangement does not require border infrastructure, and negotiate from there.In the long run, this is about much more than commerce. The friendship that has existed between the two great English-speaking democracies since 1898 (broken once, and disastrously, when the US failed to back the Suez intervention) has made the world richer, safer and freer.The values we now call universal – human rights, representative government, impartial courts, private property, free contract, personal autonomy – were largely developed in the language in which you are reading these words. If they became universal, it is because the Anglosphere triumphed militarily, first against fascism and then against revolutionary socialism.Those values seem suddenly contingent, the world order on which they rest fragile. Power is tilting towards altogether grimmer and more autocratic regimes. In such a world, the English-speaking peoples must again be ready to act in concert. Yes, the primary need is for military co-operation, diplomatic support and intelligence-sharing. But the strongest alliances are underpinned by economics. Our ultimate goal should be not just an ambitious UK-US free trade agreement, but an Anglosphere market.It may be that, in due course, Biden will re-enter the Pacific trade deal that the Obama regime negotiated and Trump rejected. If so, the US would be joining Australia, New Zealand, Canada and (by then) the UK. A deeper Five Eyes trade arrangement could nestle within the Pacific pact, as the Australia-New Zealand deal does today.Perhaps – who knows? – Ireland might one day want to join. John F Kennedy, the first US President of Irish Catholic origin, was perhaps the most solidly Anglophile leader his country has had. He was obsessed with British history, saw Winston Churchill as the saviour of freedom and, deep down, wanted to put right the defeatism that his father had displayed as ambassador to London. It was JFK who, in 1962, knocked aside the doubts of his officials and insisted on giving the UK an independent nuclear deterrent – thereby, ultimately, making the Aukus deal possible.The Anglosphere alliance does not rest on the temperament of its national leaders. It rests, ultimately, on the readiness of its constituent nations to stand together for freedom – a readiness that may be tested sooner than we know. And in his heart, Joe Biden knows it.More from NewsMother dies while waiting on phone for GP appointmentBoris Johnson demands pay rise for lorry driversDuke and Duchess of Sussex hit out at \u0026#39ultra-wealthy pharmaceutical companies\u0026#39The energy price cap is a sledgehammer imposed to limit market freedomDon\u0026#39t fail the next generation on homes, Robert Jenrick warnsLabour angers unionists with ‘the north of Ireland’ provocationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"detectives asking dash cam footage hunt suspect sabina nessa","story":"Motorists who drove near where Sabina Nessa was killed are being urged to check dashcam footage because her killer was likely to have been repeatedly caught in the glare of car headlights.Detectives are hoping to piece together their prime suspect’s movements before he was captured on CCTV outside an apartment block as he fled the crime scene in Kidbrooke, south-east London, on September 17.They also hope someone will recall seeing the man, who remains at large, carrying a “red reflective object, and possibly trying to conceal it up his sleeve.”A police spokesman added: “Officers retain an open mind as to whether this was used in the attack.”Meanwhile, people in Kent as well as London are being encouraged to circulate and study the CCTV footage to see if they recognise him.The 28-year-old primary school teacher is understood to have been killed near her home on the outskirts of Cator Park at about 8.30pm. Her body was found 400yds away near a community centre the following day.The attacker’s route from the crime scene to Pegler Square, where he was captured on CCTV, would have meant he was visible to commuters on two roads. The busiest was the A2213, a vital artery for commuters heading south from the capital towards Kent and Sussex at the weekend.The other street, Cambert Way, which her assailant would have had to cross, possibly while carrying her, cuts through Cator Park.The only CCTV image of the suspect shows him walking past Cobham House in Pegler Square, back towards the A2213.To get to that spot from the park, he would have had to take one of two routes right next to the A2213. He could have clambered over security fencing into a building site, where a new apartment block is being built, or jumped over a small wall. Both routes would mean he had no choice but to walk past the Cobham House CCTV camera. Otherwise, he would have had to risk entering Pegler Square, which has a supermarket, pub and railway station, all with numerous surveillance cameras.On Saturday night, a contract worker said that police had earlier conducted fingertip searches of the building site where he was working on the new apartment blocks. He added how construction was in its early stages and the site was a “warren of open drains, piping and stacked up building materials.On Friday, police with sticks also conducted searches along both the fencing and wall the suspect may have climbed over.It raises the prospect the killer may have discarded a weapon or left other forensic evidence as he fled before being caught on CCTV.Detective Chief Inspector Neil John, from the politan Police’s Specialist Crime Command, said: “I continue to appeal for any witnesses and anyone with information to contact police and share what they know.“People in the Kidbrooke area last Friday may recall seeing this man carrying a red reflective object, and possibly trying to conceal it up his sleeve. If so, please call police.”He added: “Please share the CCTV footage on social media and, especially if you have connections to London or Kent, show the image to family members and friends who may not have seen it. He must be traced.“We all saw at yesterday evening’s vigil, the impact that Sabina’s death has had on the community.

Due to the concerns you have raised, I have directed my team to monitor the situation and should there be any breach of CIC legislation I will not hesitate to act accordingly.Brendan Clarke-Smith, one of the signatories of the letter to Ms Smyth, and a member of the Common Sense Group of Conservative MPs said: “It’s a relief that the regulator has acknowledged our concerns, and that they have requested a meeting with the directors of Stop Funding Hate to discuss this further.The actions of this group and its attacks on free speech are not only an affront to democracy, but have undermined the trust that many people might have had in Community Interest Companies - most of which do such important work.Ministers should now work to strengthen existing regulations to ensure that in the future these fringe groups are unable to exploit loopholes in this cynical way.”In letters to Ms Smith and Kwasi Kwarteng, the Business Secretary, last month, the Tory backbenchers claimed that Stop Funding Hate has been exploiting the prestige that is afforded by CIC status, and the privileged access that CICs have to many grants of taxpayers money, for overtly political means.In June, it emerged that The Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust had given £50,000 to Stop Funding Hate. The charity said the sum was a a restricted grant for a project to encourage responsible media through an ethical advertising code, adding that it takes great care with our grant-making and we carry out detailed due diligence and monitoring.Official guidance states that a CIC may engage in political activities if its engagement in them can reasonably be considered as incidental to activities which a reasonable person might consider are carried on for the benefit of the community, and which are not themselves incidental to political activities. For example, a CIC that uses a community centre for activities, which benefit local people, may be able to lobby local government for a grant to improve the facilities available in the building.Stop Funding Hate describes itself as a community-driven campaign whose supporter community includes people from across UK society, united by a shared commitment to overcoming hatred and challenging all forms of discrimination. Its goal is to make hate unprofitable.But, in their letters the MPs stated: Rather than advocate on behalf of a group in society Stop Funding Hate are doing the exact inverse of what CICs are permitted to do. They are proactively advocating against a group in society, namely the hundreds of thousands of people who tune into GB News every day, and the 60 per cent of the population who do not want to see brands engage in cancel culture of boycotts of TV stations.Last month, following this newspaper\u0027s report on the MPs\u0027 letter, Stop Funding Hate asked supporters on its Facebook group to follow a series of rules including refraining from posting comments which promote any political organisation or campaign. On Saturday, Richard Wilson, the director of Stop Funding Hate, said: This is not the first time that vexatious complaints have been made about Stop Funding Hate’s work. However we have received no correspondence from the CIC Regulator in relation to these latest claims.Stop Funding Hate is a non-political human rights organisation working to build a better media through the promotion of ethical advertising. All of our activities have been fully consistent with the law, and any suggestion to the contrary is wholly unfounded.More from NewsMother dies while waiting on phone for GP appointmentBoris Johnson demands pay rise for lorry driversDuke and Duchess of Sussex hit out at \u0026#39ultra-wealthy pharmaceutical companies\u0026#39The energy price cap is a sledgehammer imposed to limit market freedomDon\u0026#39t fail the next generation on homes, Robert Jenrick warnsLabour angers unionists with ‘the north of Ireland’ provocationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"lived winter discontent boris can avoid turning ted heath","story":"News last week about soaring fuel prices was the final part of the jigsaw. I did not need any more convincing: this really does feel like a weird return to Britain in the 1970s.For me, it is more than a vaguely remembered glimpse into the past. I became a BBC reporter in the summer of 1970 and, as with all formative experiences, it is a decade seared in my memory. The eerie old mood music is inescapable. I am not thinking of the songs, although it is uncanny that new Abba tunes are being released. The BBC isn’t helping by putting on repeats of Fawlty Towers and The Good Life.For those of us who lived through the 1970s, there is a clear sense that the bad times are back again. It is not a cheery trip down memory lane. It feels more like an awful warning.My first foreign assignment was to Vietnam, to cover the last stages of that “forever war”. In 1972, my bosses at Broadcasting House thought Saigon would fall they didn’t share their thoughts with me, they simply sent me to find out. In fact, it was three years later that South Vietnam was defeated, and then I was in the press room at the White House reporting for Radio 4’s Today programme on the last helicopter lifting off from the roof of the American Embassy.Gerald Ford was the interim president, and the man who took over was the peanut farmer, Democrat Jimmy Carter. He won because he was not the disgraced Republican president, Richard Nixon. The parallel is obvious: Joe Biden, who was not Donald Trump, brought us last month’s shambolic withdrawal from Kabul. For Vietnam, read Afghanistan. A bit spooky, don’t you think?The sharp rise in fuel prices and the ever-growing fear of inflation is the narrative arc which pulls the two decades together. The Bank of England has revealed that it now expects inflation, which saw a sharp increase last month to 3.2 per cent, to exceed 4 per cent before the year is out and remain there into the second quarter of next year. And it’s thanks to the energy price shock that last week queues formed outside petrol stations – once a familiar sight during the 1970s global oil crisis.Families are once again making an early start on their Christmas shopping, amid fears of a toy shortage caused by ongoing supply chain problems. In the 1970s, a shortage of plastic, sparked by the oil crisis, caused production problems for popular toys, from clacker balls and Space Hoppers to the Mastermind board game.That decade saw the first real signs that energy supplies could be crucial. For the influential pressure group, the Club of Rome, running out of fossil fuels was a serious threat.For today’s climate militants, abundant supplies of fossil fuels are the real cause for concern. The Club of Rome was keen on bringing economic development to a standstill with its zero-growth mantra. Present-day climate activists are inspired by the call for zero carbon. They too insist that not only governments but private citizens should take action. We should cut out red meat because it comes from cows emitting methane gas. Decades apart, they seem to share the same conclusion: hair shirts all round.In the early 1970s, I remember a prominent news presenter suggesting we should leave our comfortable lives to join her and others in forming a Somerset commune. To my embarrassment, she cheekily suggested I would be perfect commune material. Thankfully, I never got to pack my sandals.Allegra Stratton is the Government’s spokesperson on the COP26 climate change conference to be held next month in Glasgow. To much amusement, she suggested we could all do our bit by not rinsing our dishes before putting them into the dishwasher. It immediately brought to mind the advice given by one of Ted Heath’s cabinet ministers, Patrick Jenkin: his idea for saving power during the Three-Day Week – when, for three long months from midnight on New Year’s Day 1974, the Government imposed limits on electricity to reduce usage and help eke out coal reserves depleted by union strikes – was for all of us to brush our teeth in the dark.There was merriment partly because, in those days, there was much less talk about the need for the Government to send a message. Last week, when Boris Johnson took a train, and not the plane, from New York to Washington, no one laughed. On the eve of his climate speech at the UN, it was treated like routine PR.In the 1970s, union-backed strikes were frequent, and as I followed Heath around on his attempted re-election campaign in 1974, he routinely argued that the election would answer the simple question: “Who rules Britain?” At the ballot box, the response came swiftly: “Not you, mate.”It became clear in the months that followed that, increasingly, people were not expecting the answer to be found at Westminster. In February 1974, Labour’s Harold Wilson returned to power – but it wasn’t long before his replacement Jim Callaghan was at the helm, desperately trying to keep a lid on inflation with an official pay policy. BBC staff would buy steak in the subsidised canteen to take it home to their families.There was a common view throughout much of the 1970s that the country was, in effect, leaderless, best summed up in the famous winter of discontent headline attributed to Callaghan: “Crisis, what crisis?” I remember at a high-powered political reception a well-known industrialist came up to me and said, without any preamble: “Is Britain ungovernable?” As a BBC correspondent I could not, of course, openly agree, but the mood of pessimism was unavoidable.Britain’s image abroad suffered. On a Tube train from Heathrow airport with a group of newly-arrived Americans, I was startled when one of them shouted and pointed at some allotments by the side of the track. “Look,” he exclaimed to his friends, “subsistence farming.” To him, we were obviously down on our knees.In 1979, it all ended in public humiliation for the Labour government. When there is speculation now of a new winter of discontent, I feel a shudder remembering the rubbish that wasn’t cleared, the bodies that weren’t buried. It is not the same.This is where it is dangerous to make too close a connection with the past. Politics now does not depend on the hope of a Conservative revival. Labour is still unable to pose as a government-in-waiting, and Sir Keir Starmer is no Margaret Thatcher. The unions have nothing like the power they used to wield. Disputes over ideology have lost their bite. The pandemic has forced the Conservatives to become unlikely advocates of the Big State.But Covid has thrown up a raft of problems, too, which has left many voters feeling let down and marginalised. That is why I am thankful the true spirit of the 1970s is firmly in the past. I spent a good deal of that decade covering the conflict in Northern Ireland, and reporting on wars abroad, often at the end of a crackly telephone line. Computer wizardry was in its infancy. Colour television had only just arrived. The human genome had not been charted, and we would not have been able to mount in less than a year a successful vaccination campaign against a deadly virus.It is fun to play with history but, like children, we should be careful about playing with fire. One of the key lessons from the 1970s is that, in a relatively short period of time, how easy it is for an administration to lose control. Now, the country is emerging from its toughest civil emergency since the war. A sense of proportion is what is needed.John Sergeant is former chief political correspondent of the BBC and former political editor of ITN.

There’s a real appetite for it to be business as usual as much as possible.”While she returned to public duties in May following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh, the coming year will see the Royal Family front and centre as the country gears up for the Platinum Jubilee celebrations.Up to November 1, the Queen already has seven pre-announced public engagements.In 2019, pre-pandemic, there were three comparable public engagements, along with the State Opening of Parliament and numerous events behind Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace walls.In 2018 there were two, plus the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank, as well as a state visit from the Netherlands.Not since 2013 has there been seven public engagements, with between two and four events in the court circular each October following. Then, the Queen was joined by the Duke of Edinburgh for the majority, hosting receptions together for the Commonwealth Health of Government meeting and visiting the National Theatre and a fish market.In 2012, the Diamond Jubilee year had fewer traditional engagements but more glamour, seeing them attend a gala celebration at the Royal Opera House, the newly-developed Jubilee Gardens on the South Bank in London, and unveil the Windsor and Eton Society Diamond Jubilee TributeIn 2011, when the Queen was a youthful 85 years old, she spent part of the autumn overseas in Australia with Prince Philip, with lively court circular entries noting them attending the “Big Aussie Barbecue”.Now 95 and without her consort, the Queen will be keeping busy with the company of her children Prince Charles, Princess Anne and Prince Edward.On October 1, she will be joined by the Prince of Wales at Balmoral for the start of planting season for the Queen’s Green Canopy project.The next day, the pair will attend the opening ceremony of the Sixth Session of the Scottish Parliament.Returning from Balmoral, she will be accompanied by the Earl of Wessex to launch the Queen’s Baton Relay for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games from the forecourt of Buckingham Palace.On the 12th, along with the Princess Royal, she will attend a Westminster Abbey service of thanksgiving marking the centenary of the Royal British Legion.In events currently listed in the royal diary as solo engagements, she will go on to open the Sixth Session of the Senedd, give a Windsor Castle reception in honour of guests at the Global Investment Summit, and attend a reception for the COP-26 environmental summit in Scotland.More from NewsMother dies while waiting on phone for GP appointmentBoris Johnson demands pay rise for lorry driversDuke and Duchess of Sussex hit out at \u0026#39ultra-wealthy pharmaceutical companies\u0026#39The energy price cap is a sledgehammer imposed to limit market freedomDon\u0026#39t fail the next generation on homes, Robert Jenrick warnsLabour angers unionists with ‘the north of Ireland’ provocationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"time recognise wives aristocracy says duchess rutland","story":"Period dramas have made Britain’s stately homes famous the world over, along with the Dukes, Lords and Earls who, from inside these grand buildings, pulled the great levers of state and empire.But less well known are the women who made sure these famous country piles didn’t crumble into dust with the passing years.Now the holder of one of the country’s oldest female titles has said it is time the central role of the ladies of the aristocracy in ensuring the survival of the country’s castles, palaces and manor houses was more widely recognised.As Emma Manners, Duchess of Rutland, likes to say, “behind every great man” stood a woman making sure their homes continued to thrive and retain their stately splendour.“Our role has not really been recognised on the domestic front. It’s time for us to be recognised,” she says. “It’s starting to happen. There’s an awakening to the story of female domestic roles in general. We’ve undervalued that role for too long.”For her that role has meant ensuring the economic survival of Belvoir Castle and the 1,600 acre Rutland estate by developing its retail and commercial opportunities, such as shooting parties, wedding hire, farm and provision shops, restaurants and cafés.She is now busy preparing for one of the the highlights of the year at Belvoir – a Regency-themed Christmas spectacular. Designed by Charlotte Lloyd Webber, the sumptuously decorated rooms and light trail open next month with more than a nod to the Netflix costume romp Bridgerton.But her role has also meant staying true to the artistic vision of her predecessors by restoring their magnificent castle home to its former splendour.Chief among the Duchess’s achievements has been her decade-long project to complete Capability Brown’s unfinished design for the castle’s gardens and grounds. This began when she found his original drawings and resolved to finish the job he’d been unable to complete before his death in 1783.“I’m very bad at detail. I’m a big picture person and when we found his plans in 2005 it was a perfect opportunity for me,” she told The . “We started in 2011 and have followed the plans to the letter.”The daughter of a Welsh farmer, Emma Watkins was not born into the landed gentry. But after meeting David Manners, 11th Duke of Rutland, at a London dinner party she – like many of her titled counterparts – assumed the mantle of responsibility for the upkeep of their estate. By then she had held a variety of jobs, from estate agent to interior designer.“When I married David at 29 we lived in a converted stable block and this beast dominated the landscape, casting a shadow over us,” she says, waving her hand in the direction of the castle ramparts which dominate the Leicestershire and Lincolnshire landscape for miles around.“I didn’t understand the world of heritage. I looked at it in awe. But the great thing about having a woman at the helm is that each woman brings her particular strength to the house, to the tapestry of that home,” she says.One of the Duchess’s friends, Charlotte Brudenell, wife of Robert Brudenell, found herself in a similar position and has spent years restoring Deene Park, the ancestral Northamptonshire home of the Earls Cardigan, with the assistance of her husband Robert’s mother Marian.“My job is to make sure the house exists, is looked after, is maintained. I\u0027m the defender of Deene and I feel great support from the other women in this position,” Charlotte told Emma on her podcast, Duchess.The current Duchess of Rutland’s central role at Belvoir Castle echoes that of her predecessor, Duchess Elizabeth, who married the 5th Duke of Rutland in 1799.It was Elizabeth, whose marriage dowry saved her new husband’s family from bankruptcy, who commissioned a new Belvoir Castle and who designed all the state rooms, including the Versailles-inspired Elizabeth Saloon. She also personally designed the ceiling roses in the State Dining Room, each one unique.But though a woman’s job in a stately home is never done, the current Duchess does credit Britain’s male nobility with the good sense to recognise the role their wives could play – not only in running and repairing their grand homes, but in building and maintaining the aristocracy\u0027s links with their local communities, if only for self-preservation.It was this which the Russian and French nobility forgot to do, the Duchess points out, to their eventual bloody ruin.“The French and Russian aristocracy became disconnected from their communities and paid the price,” she says. “The British aristocracy were very wise and subconsciously knew what they needed. They had the intuition about who to bring in to support them – which was the women – and they empowered them to grow their own wings, which is an incredible gift. Every woman runs her home, it’s just that mine is a bit bigger. It’s a heritage home and you need help to run it.”Symbolic of these links with the surrounding community was a discovery the Duchess made while being shown around Belvoir Castle as a young bride by her mother-in-law Frances.In an old trunk, she found hundreds of nightdresses for newborn babies. These, her mother-in-law told her, were not for the many heirs women in her position were meant to supply, but were handed out by the then Duchess in the 1850s to ensure the village poor had at least one item of clothing for their newborns. They were then washed and handed back for the next generation of village babies.In a similar spirit, the current Duchess is the prime mover behind a charitable trust designed to forge links with the wider community and help children in need of support.The Countryside and Cricket Trust, run by former player Darren Bicknell, allows 100s of boys and girls from surrounding towns and inner-cities to enjoy Belvoir’s cricket facilities.“I know I have to make Belvoir a sustainable business, but how are we going to keep that sense of connection with our communities? That’s the ongoing project,” she says. “We’re not going away. We can do plenty together.”More from NewsMother dies while waiting on phone for GP appointmentBoris Johnson demands pay rise for lorry driversDuke and Duchess of Sussex hit out at \u0026#39ultra-wealthy pharmaceutical companies\u0026#39The energy price cap is a sledgehammer imposed to limit market freedomDon\u0026#39t fail the next generation on homes, Robert Jenrick warnsLabour angers unionists with ‘the north of Ireland’ provocationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela rayner promises new deal","story":":root Angela Rayner promises New Deal for Working People in Labour conference barnstormerThe Deputy leader told Labour Party Conference: \"We must become the government our nation deserves, not the one it has\"Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner Image: Ian Vogler   Daily MirrorByMikey SmithWhitehall Correspondent:,  Sep | comments Angela Rayner promised a New Deal for Working People within  days of a Labour government, in a barnstorming speech at the opening of the party’s annual conference.Party faithful flocked to Brighton this weekend for their first conference in person since . Internal rows over party rule changes provoked a bitter atmosphere among some delegates on the first day of the event. But the Deputy Leader’s energetic opening speech prompted loud applause from delegates. She told attendees: “We must become the government our nation deserves, not the one it has.” Launching the party’s Green Paper for working people, Ms Rayner said: “I’m not presenting you with a policy document that will sit on the shelf collecting dust,” she said. “Let’s make this real and show every worker in every workplace in every corner of our country that with their support, their lives, their jobs and their communities can and will be better.” The proposals would see the minimum wage increased to at least £ an hour for all workers.  It would extend full workers rights to all-but the genuinely self employed - including sick pay, holiday pay, parental leave and protection against unfair dismissal. Flexible working would be a right for all workers as a default, alongside the right to switch off outside of working hours. And zero-hours contracts would be banned, with all workers having the right to a regular contract and predictable hours - with last-minute sht cancellations paid in full. Ms Rayner added: “This Green Paper is for every parent tearing your hair out about childcare, or who missed a sports day or parents evening because you couldn’t come in and leave early. “It’s for every young person who daren’t turn down a sht on a zero hours contract because you might not get hours next week, who can’t take a break and can’t get sick. “And it’s for every worker who went to work and never made it home, and for their families who will never see them again.” Taking aim at Boris Johnson ’s government, Ms Rayner said: “There’s only one rule with this Cabinet and that is that there’s one rule for them and another rule for us.“Like the Foreign Secretary, cancelling leave for our troops and then trooping off to the beach. One rule for them, another rule for us. “The Prime Minister who got pinged and tried to go to work anyway. One for rule for them, another rule for us. “And who can forget the Barnard Castle eye test  One rule for them, and another rule for us.” And she joked that former Health Secretary Matt Hancock “has now been ordered by a court to hand over his WhatsApp messages. “Frankly, I don’t think I want to know what’s in Matt Hancock’s WhatsApp.”Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CabinetWhatsAppLabour PartyBoris JohnsonMinimum wageChildcarePoliticsLabour Party ConferenceAngela Rayner\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But she added: “No one can say I am trying to emulate Keir and certainly no one will say that Keir is trying to emulate me.” Askedshe wanted to be leader one day, she said: “I’ve seen what we do to our leaders - it petries me! “We are so brutal, even within our own movement we can be pretty brutal to our leaders. “I just want to make a dference.” She laid bare the frustrations of spending her six years in the Commons in opposition. “The thing I regret most about being in Parliament since I’ve been elected and had the privilege of representing my constituency is Iaposve been voted down so many times because we’re not in government,” she said. “I can do a good round at PMQs but that’s not going to change things for working people of this country. “What I need to do is get us into government. If I can get my little hands on getting into government in any way, stretch or form I can, Iaposll do it.”Ms Rayner revels in her role as the confident, bold and brash face and voice of Labour on the airwaves.But she admitted she gets “frightened” touring the TV and radio studios.  “It frightens me to put myself forward all the time in the way that I do as an inidual because it’s a lot of pressure, but I also think it’s important that I’m not there to represent me, I’m there to represent the people that elected me,” she said. “You don’t want to let people down, when you put yourself forward on the national stage like that.” She dismissed the brewing internal row over Labour elects future leaders as argy bargy. Keir Starmer wants to tear up the current one member, one vote system and replace it with an electoral college. That regime was axed in  to give grassroots activists the power to pick the party premier. But Mr Starmer wants toto the system that gives MPs a third of the vote, the unions a third and ordinary Labour members a third. Ms Rayner said: “It wouldn’t be a conferencewe didn’t have some form of argy bargy. “I’ve never been to a Labour Party or a trade union conference where there isn’t an argy bargy on something. “But I do think we should have a respectful debate.”  But the former union official refused to be drawn on the row. Askedshe supported the proposed overhaul, she said: “We will see what happens.” She added: “Keir’s said he wants to look at that, he’s said he wants to discuss it and consult, and heaposs doing that, and I think that’s fine. “What I don’t want it to be is a big, internal fight within the Labour Party - I think that’s very disastrous for us because ided parties don’t win elections.” She feared a row would derail Labour’s chance to showcase policies in Brighton. “I would hate to think that people’s messages out of conference‘the Labour Party are not focusing outwards’ - and I know that Keir shares that vision,” said Ms Rayner. “But you have to fix your internal as well as your external.” She added: “We make no apologies for reviewing all of the issues that we face internally, as well as focusing on the country, because we have to be ready to govern. “Me and Keir are very clear on that.” Comment MORE ON Labour PartyPMQsBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Deputy Speaker Lord Gardiner of Kimble said: “Costs would be signicant. “Full unorm will continue in ceremonial occasions and for State Opening, at which wigs will also be worn.” But many peers believe they should have been asked about the decision first. Tory Lord Patrick Cormack, , said: “There should have been a vote. If it had been the majority view I would have spoken against, but accepted it. I am a democrat.” The move puts the Lords in line with the Commons, which axed wigs in  as then-Speaker John Bercow thought them old-fashioned.The clerks also said they itched. But Tory bigwig Jacob Rees-Mogg said: “That’s feeble. They must have been itchy for centuries.”A Lords spokesperson said: “We decided against full unorm.

Mr OaposMara appeared in Sheffield Magistrateaposs Court by video link, and wore a black v-neck tee shirt. He and Mr Arnold are accused of submitting three  invoices between June and August , worth £, and purporting to be for services provided by a local disability support organisation, Confident About Autism South Yorkshire.

Meanwhile, the French outfit Teleperformance Ltd was given £million for a similar service. And HH Associates has been awarded £million to print certicates and send them to people unable to print their own or use online services. Covid passes are widespread in some countries but in the UK have only been used at limited events and for foreign travel. Vaccine passports in nightclubs and other indoor venues were due to be mandatory at the end of this month, but Mr Javid ditched the plan.

Following talks late into the evening, however, Labour’s leader agreed a new package of reforms which were backed by the party’s ruling National Executive Committee on Saturday lunchtime. The ruling body voted  to  in favour, a source said. The new changes will now be put to a showdown vote on the Labour Party conference floor on Sunday afternoon. Perhaps the most controversial will be a higher nomination bar to become a leadership candidate. Candidates will now need the backing of % of MPs, or  on current numbers. Currently the threshold is % of MPs, plus % of CLPs and % of affiliates. Originally Sir Keir’s team proposed %. Jeremy Corbyn only just managed to reach a previous % MP threshold with moments to spare in . The changes will also ditch the registered supporters scheme, which allowed people who paid a small fee and signed a declaration of support to vote in leadership elections. The NEC also backed proposals to raise the bar for which MPs can face a deselection threat. Currently,either a third of members or a third of affiliates want to block their MPsapos candidacy at the next general election, a race can be triggered. The leader’s team wants to raise the bar for a selection challenge to half of both members and trade unions affiliates.  Finally the NEC backed a move to cut the number of grassroots conference motions debated at the partyaposs annual gathering each year. Only six plus six motions will be able to be put forward, rather than  plus , under the proposed changes. Keir Starmer said in a statement: “I’m very pleased these party reforms have got the backing of our NEC. These proposals put us in a better position to win the next general election and I hope constituency and trade union delegates will support them when they come to conference floor” The new set of reforms are still likely to be highly controversial with the Left - and will put be put to conference delegates who are meeting in Brighton from today until Wednesday. It has been a dficult start to the Leaderaposs first in-person conference since he was elected Corbynaposs successor. Labour Deputy Leader Angela Rayner, who is said to have been sceptical about ing the party to the electoral college system, is due to speak at pm. This afternoon delegates will vote on whether to confirm Starmeraposs appointment of David Evans as general secretary, which may be a flashpoint with the Left following a programme of cuts.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Jeremy CorbynNEC CorporationLabour PartyEducationSchoolsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

One way or another. In a few days the Labour leader will have secured his position as the true hope of an alternative to the Tories for a better Britain. Or he will have cemented his place in the public mind as that serious, nice man who’ll never make it to be PM. The stakes could not be higher as Labour meets in Brighton for a ­conference that is both showcase and battlefield. An opportunity for Keir to shine a light on the man the public has yet to connect with, on his policies and on his vision for the future. But played out against a calculated gladiatorial clash with the unions and the left.  The unheralded emergence of plans for a major shake-up of the party power structure dismayed many in advance of a gathering that was supposed to be all about unity. But Keir is determined to grandstand the extinction of any remnants of Corbynism, whose passion still flickers in the embers of the party’s worst ­election defeat in its history. The risk is that the look is same old warring Labour. But the boys and girls in the backroom strategy office decided a stand-up fight was good box office. Here’s one: “Not all internal conflict is electoral bad news…it can strengthen a leader. If they lose but show the will to fight, their courage can inspire the party and the electorate.” Stand by to be inspired.  The first live mass gathering of the party since the lawyer son of a toolmaker and nurse won the top job  long months ago, it has been billed as a chance to prove the party is still a ­credible choice for voters at the next election. Indeed, it could be a tipping point. Like the climate change that will ­determine the weather on the seafront outside the conference hall, the point of nois dangerously close for Labour. Similarly, all the indicators are scarily obvious. Against the worst, morally Teflon-coated PM in living memory, Labour lags behind in the polls. As Boris Johnson’s ham-fisted, ideologically twisted Government tears the sinews of civilised le apart, Keir needs to brandish a big idea that will turn the electoral tide. It is delusional to imagine the inevitable bursting of Boris’s balloon will automatically transfer into electoral success for Labour. Policies have been rolled out, open goal screamers have hit the back of the Commons net. But few have noticed and few have been convinced. Too many share the feeling, as one member on their way to the seaside put it, that “Keir doesn’t even seem to know where the ball is”. Critics detect more than a whf of Blairism revisited in attacks on the left. Yet even the high priest of New Labour, Lord Mandelson, calls for a “more radical” message. Something perhaps with a bit more high-velocity impact than a -page pamphlet on political motherhood and apple pie. The good news is that Keir faces an electorate showing signs of wanting to listen, willing to be convinced. It’s a chance he can’t afford to flunk. As he said in a message to delegates: “We can only create a successful, modern Britainwe seize this moment.” No pressure, Keir.

And nothing is more important to children than their future. So Keir Starmer is right to pledge an education revolution to ensure a future fair to all. It cannot be fair that children from poorer backgrounds lag  months behind their wealthier peers at GCSE level – simply because parents can afford to pay fees.So it is only right the VAT and business rate exemptions private schools enjoy through charitable status be abolished. The £.billion that would bring in would be erted to state schools in desperate need of the money.This newspaper believes in free choice – and that includes the freedom for people to choose how they spend their money. But the taxpayer should not have to subsidise that choice. Nor should some children miss out because their privileged peers have it all. In the computer-reliant st Century, every child should have a laptop at home. That is what this money will provide. Careers advice is not just for privileged children. This extra money will pay for that valuable guidance in the state sector too. But none of this can happen unless Sir Keir becomes Prime Minister, which is why Labour’s conference in Brighton this week is so crucial. We accept that until now the Labour leader has been hamstrung by the pandemic. For the first year of his leadership, he was unable to shake hands with a single voter. And this week is his first opportunity to address the party faithful face to face.  But despite those handicaps, his critics continue to carp. They accuse him of failing to inspire, of having no policies and of a lack of vision and direction. These are all points Sir Keir must address in his conference speech. And from what we have seen of it so far, it will be a barnstormer. Labour is now awash with policies, from tackling climate change to dealing with the catastrophe of Universal Credit. And as our exclusive interview with him today shows, Sir Keir has direction and his vision is  . Now he must also prove that he can inspire people, so Labour activists leave Brighton with a spring in their step and Labour’s feet firmly set on the road to No. That is a more dficult task for a man who is not naturally flamboyant. And Sir Keir is beset by the some of the same dficulties previous leaders wrestled with, among them Neil Kinnock and Tony Blair – namely those posed by the hard left. But the socialist revolution promised by Jeremy Corbyn was rejected in two elections. And had Labour persisted, it would simply have been rejected in a third. The Tory Party in power today is without principles. Labour has principles aplenty – but principles without power to implement them are just so much well-meaning waffle. Sir Keir has all the decency and determination to change the lives of British people for the better. This week he must show why he is the right man to do it.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Labour PartyPoliticsKeir Starmer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Have a story to tell The good news is Labour is a party rooted in strong values. The bad news is they have few policies on which to hang those values. Nobody is expecting the party to produce a fully-costed manesto this far out from a general election. But voters would like a taster of what Labour would do in power.Until Keir Starmer has something to say he will remain vulnerable to the Tory attack that he is carping on the sidelines while they get on with the business of government.The Labour leader urgently needs a story to tell of how his party will improve people’s lives and transform the fortunes of the country. Be more nimble Opposition is hard. It is especially demoralising when you are up against a party with an -seat majority. All opposition parties face the same Catch-: you cannot get a fair hearing because people are sceptical you can win power but you cannot win power unless you get a fair hearing. Labour needs to be quicker to seize the few opportunities it gets. When major news events occur, such as the energy crisis, then it should be on the front foot saying how they would do things dferently. Lead, don’t follow. Be more welcoming At some point Labour forgot the basic rule of politics - to gain power you need to win people over to your side. That means welcoming people with whom you may disagree, including Tory voters. Fairly or unfairly the perception of Labour is of a party that has become a haven for the self-righteous, the worthy and the woke rather than an organisation that represents all sections of society. The party has been better at preaching than reaching out. It needs to starting building bridges so former voters can feel comfortable ing to the party. Regain trust Obviously, this is easier said than done. In some areas, such as health and education, Labour is still trusted by the voters but in others, notably the economy and immigration, they have lost the confidence of the public. There has been some progress since Starmer became leader but more must be done to prove that Labour can once again be trusted with the country’s finances.  Stop fighting internal battles Labour has always been a broad church. When in power this can be something to celebrate but in opposition this can be a liability. In recent years the congregation has spent more time engaged in feuds and bloodletting than in singing with one voice. Rather than seeking converts, they have preferred to hunt dissenters. Instead of attacking the Tories, they have spent more time attacking each other. Those who called for unity under previous leaderships may wish to start practising what they used to preach. Broaden the palate If the Labour Party does not stand up for the vulnerable, the poorest and the voiceless then it has no purpose. As Harold Wilson said, Labour is a moral crusade or it is nothing. It is right that the opposition holds the Government to account on poverty and social security. But Labour cannot be seen as exclusively as the party of welfare and the NHS. Issues such as the technological revolution, the changing face of work, and law and order also matter to voters yet Labour has so far had little to say on these subjects.  You cannot please everyone Yes, elections are won by those parties with the broadest appeal but you have to realise you cannot please everyone. Voters have an instinctive ability to tell when a politician is saying something for the sake of it rather than because they believe it. Certain sections of the public may not always agree with you but they have more respect for someone who sticks to their beliefs than someone who tries to pretend they are something they are not.Labour’s contortions over Brexit demonstrated there is much to be lost and little to be gained by trying to sit on the fence.Remind people of your record Labour governments can make a dference. In power Labour introduced the Equal PayAct, Sure Start, the Equality Act, the national minimum wage and Sex Discrimination Act . If you spend your time trashing your record in government don’t be surprisedvoters start to share that opinion. If you take pride in what you achieved then voters will be reminded of why they once voted for you.  Rediscover aspiration The former leader of the Transport and General Workers Union Ron Todd once said: “What do you say to a docker who earns £ a week, owns his house, a new car, a microwave and a video, as well as a small place near Marbella  You do not say ‘let me take you out of your misery, brother’.” Labour has a great story to tell on aspiration, it just forgets to say it. The party needs to remind people how its policies have helped lt people out of poverty, given them an education and opened doors they thought were closed. Unite the Kingdom If the Tories insist on playing the isive card, Labour needs to deal the unity one. The vast majority of Britons are fed up with culture wars, arguments over Brexit and the constant attempts to play off one part of society against another. The temptation is engage with the Conservative games. A better strategy would be to present yourselves as unying force that can heal the wounds the Tories have opened.

At the heart of the party’s proposal to revive the struggling sector is legislating for collective bargaining so trade unions can negotiate pay and terms on behalf of workers.The move would bolster care for those in need - and boost wages and staff retention, said Labour aposs deputy leader, Ms Rayner.The industry is notorious for low pay and employees quitting the sector.Former agency care worker and Unison trade union official Ms Rayner unveils the plan at the party’s annual conference in Brighton on Saturday - and vows to make it her top priorityKeir Starmer becomes Prime Minister. Speaking exclusively to the Mirror, which is campaigning for Fair Care for All, she said: “I have seen that the collective voice improves not just the standards for workers but improves the level of care and the service that people get. “I was really passionate about it when I was a home carer.” Boris Johnson famously declared on his first day as PM in July  that “I am announcing now, on the steps of Downing Street, that we will fix the crisis in social care once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve” - before waiting  months to publish it.Ms Rayner, the party’s Shadow Secretary of State for the Future of Work, signalled Labour’s plan would be brought to Parliament less than three weeks after the party s to office. “Within the days of the next Labour Government .. the first thing I’m going to say, when Keir’s Prime Minister, is ‘Right, this is what my driving goal as Deputy Prime Minister is - to drive this Employment Rights Bill right the way through so we can deliver that immediately’,” she revealed. Under Labour’s plan for Fair Pay Agreements, workers’ leaders and bosses would “be brought together by the Government to establish and agree minimum pay, terms and conditions which will be binding on all employers and workers in the sector”, the party said.  It added: “The Fair Pay Agreement would then form a ‘floor’ in a sector, preventing exploitative employers from undercutting the many good employers.”Ms Rayner blasted the right-wing caricature of collective bargaining, saying people think it “is about Punch ‘n’ Judy, the management versus the staff and the union”.Recalling how she fought for better conditions when she was a union rep, she added: “Actually we worked collaboratively to have a programme called Delivering the Workforce which meant that the girls that worked in home care - and they were predominantly women then - had a career path, they had a skills training set. “The staff retention was amazing, staff sickness levels went down, therefore the employers saved money, the service was improved and the workers had better work le balance and better terms and conditions. “I see collective bargaining as a win-win.” Ms Rayner said care work could be “incredibly rewarding but it can be demoralisingyou don’t get the time and the training to do the job properly”. “You feel it personally,” she said. Fair Pay Agreements would begin in the care sector but eventually be rolled out to other sectors. “I think every industry should look at it,” said Ms Rayner. They would work alongside existing pay agreements and legal minimums, such as the £-an-hour minimum wage which Labour pledges for all workers. In contrast, the Governmentaposs “national living wage” – the rebranded minimum – is £. an hour and only paid to workers aged  and over.  Hourly minimum pay for under-s is £. the rate for workers aged  to  is £. and the minimum for those aged  and  is £.. Sipping tea at Powell’s Eats in South East London, where the words “Good Hope” are spelt on the wall, Ms Rayner, , expanded on her plan to overhaul workers’ rights. Labour’s shake-up would “not only deliver for workers, which I think is crucial … it’s also good for our economy and local economies,” she said. “We are in a cafe now - local people will be using this cafe. If they havenapost got any money, they won’t be coming here. “It cross-pollinates other businesses and other sectors, so it’s an important part of our programme to make being a worker in Britain a much more pleasurable experience. “People go to work to live - they don’t live for work. “People should be able to have dignity and respect at work and, by empowering employees, it actually gives employers more. “The best employers we’ve got know that and do this already.” Labour activists head to Brighton on Saturday for their annual party conference - their first big face-to-face gathering for two years.The  edition was shelved because of coronavirus, with Keir Starmer delivering his maiden speech as leader to a deserted room while standing in front of a brick wall in Doncaster.Sunshine and C temperatures are forecast for the south coast - and Angela Rayner is looking forward to the long-awaited reunion. “Covid was really dficult for a hell of a lot of people and I don’t think anyone was not affected,” she said. “I felt, when I was elected deputy leader, that my wings were clipped because ~I felt the frustration of not being able to engage and get out there. “I think Keir also expressed that - he’d only ever spoken down the lens of a camera and never actually done a speech to people. “Iaposm really looking forward to being out there. “It’s going to be really good to get out there and put our vision forward.” Trumpeting her speech, she added: “I’m starting conference on a very meaty footing - this is not a vegetarian dish, this has got plenty of meat in it.” Comment MORE ON Labour PartyUnisonBoris JohnsonMinimum wagePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The EG Group said in a statement that the move was intended to ensure everyone would have a “fair chance to refuel” and to enable sites to carry on smoothly, Manchester Evening News reports.The £ limit will not apply to emergency services and lorry drivers because of their “vital role”, the company said. The announcement comes as the government looks into introducing temporary measures to tackle the shortage of HGV drivers that has signicantly impacted a number of industries. Boris Johnson is reportedly considering relaxing UK immigration rules to allow more foreign drivers into the country, although No  insisted any measures would be “very strictly time-limited”.Up to , temporary visas could be granted for HGV drivers, according to the Financial Times and the , as authorities scramble to tackle the problem of empty supermarket shelves and closed petrol stations.Esso, BP and Tesco forecourts have been affected by challenges getting petrol deliveries. BP said that around  or its , forecourts were closed due to a lack of available fuel, and between  and  sites have been affected by the loss of at least one grade of fuel. Esso owner ExxonMobil said a “small number” of Tesco refilling stations have also been impacted. In a statement published by the EG group, a spokesperson said: “Due to the current unprecedented customer demand for fuel and associated supply challenges we have taken the decision to introduce a limit of £ per customer on all of our grades of fuel. This excludes HGV drivers and emergency services due to their vital role at this time. “This is a company decision to ensure all our customers have a fair chance to refuel and to enable our sites to carry on running smoothly. We kindly ask everyone visiting our sites to treat our colleagues, supply chain partners and customers with respect during these very challenging times.  All of EG Group’s UK sites remain open and operational to serve customers.” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has urged drivers not to panic buy petrol, amid chaotic scenes at petrol stations across the country. Speaking to Sky News on Friday, he said that motorists should “carry on as normal”. Meanwhile, a survey by the Office for National Statisticsfound that around one in six adults in Britain said they were not able to buy essential food items at some point during the past two weeks, due to products not being available. A Downing Street spokesman said: We have ample fuel stocks in this country and the public should be reassured there are no shortages. But like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary Covid-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country. Weaposre looking at temporary measures to avoid any immediate problems, but any measures we introduce will be very strictly time-limited. We are moving to a high-wage, high-skilled economy and businesses will need to adapt with more investment in recruitment and training to provide long-term resilience.

The Department for Educationtoday announces it has expanded its Glasses in Classes scheme to reach more than , pupils in at least  schools in England. It was trialled in Bradford and will now be expanded to Doncaster, Derby, Durham, Norwich and Breckland, and the North Yorkshire Coast. Children identied as needing glasses will receive one pair for home and one for school to help improve reading and writing skills. Children can already get free eye tests and vouchers for glasses but experts fear many poorer pupils do not have sight problems spotted in time. Under the scheme, pupils receive support from a vision co-ordinator, usually a teaching assistant, to attend follow-up eye examinations, get their prescription glasses and wear them regularly.  Schools do not usually get the results of vision screenings that pupils take in reception. But during the pilot, these results were shared with staff in schools so they knew which pupils and families to support. The scheme, first piloted at  primary schools in Bradford, aims to prevent disadvantaged pupils from being left behind because of poor eyesight. It will now be adapted for five disadvantaged areas in England under the DfEaposs Opportunity Areas programme - where the Government has targeted more resources at  social mobility cold spots. Speaking on National Eye Health Week, Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: As a young boy shortly after arriving in this country, I sat at the back of the classroom with poor language skills and low confidence, struggling to engage with my lessons. Back then, I could never have dreamt of the opportunities this country would give me and I am determined to help every young person overcome obstacles, just as I was supported. Too many children still struggle with the literacy skills they need to make the most of their education. Simple steps like providing free glasses to those that need them so they can clearly see words on a page, for example, can help close the literacy gap and foster a love of learning. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said: This novel scheme focuses on young people whose learning is hampered by poor eyesight and whose circumstances mean they have either not been to see an optician or do not have the glasses they need. It is refreshing to see the Government reacting positively to a local initiative that has seen results in Bradford and extending it to a further five disadvantaged areas in the north of the country. It would be greatit could eventually be rolled out on a national basis to bring the same benefits to all young people. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leadersapos union NAHT, said: It is essential that the Government invests more in education and young people, and does so without delay. Programmes like this are encouraging but what the education sector is crying out for is a fully funded strategy for education recovery which meets the needs of all pupils in all areas of the country. Thereaposs no time to waste, particularly because the Comprehensive Spending Review will be delivered next month.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Paul WhitemanNadhim ZahawiEducationSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Rising energy prices Tories have admitted that Brits face a tough winter ahead - with people in the North more likely to be hammered by rising energy prices.A surge in global gas prices has put pressure on domestic energy suppliers, several of which have already gone bust.Spiralling wholesale costs look set to filter down to household bills.The energy price cap protects consumers from sudden hikes in their bills, but it also means that suppliers have gone to the wall as they can’t pass on higher costs to their customers.But some .million households have seen their providers collapse, meaning they face uncertainty about which company will take on their supply and how much it will cost.The energy price cap is already set to rise on October  by £, and ministers are in talks with regulator Ofgem about the next review in Aprilgas costs remain high.Petrol shortagesMotorists are facing fuel shortages at the pumps as a lack of HGV drivers wreaked havoc on the supply chain.BP, Esso and Tesco petrol forecourts were hit by shortages, with large queues reported on Friday as drivers tried to fill up.BP said that around  of its , petrol forecourts were closed due to a lack of available fuel, with between  and  sites affected by the loss of at least one grade of fuel.There is a shortage of , drivers, according to the Road Haulage Association, with the situation exacerbated by Covid pressures and Brexit red tape.Ministers were locked in talks on Friday over how to alleviate the shortage, with changes to immigration rules considered to make it easier for foreign drivers to fill the gap. Empty shelvesShoppers have already seen some empty shelves due to a shortage of carbon dioxide linked to the global gas shortage.US-owned fertiliser plant CF Industries was handed a Government bailout to restart its UK operations after halting production due to the gas price rise.Its UK plants are major suppliers of CO, which it produces as a by-product.Carbon dioxide is used for a range of things in the food sector, including stunning animals before slaughter and keeping fresh products chilled.The shortage of lorry drivers has also compounded issues.Retailers warned there were just  days to save Christmas from signicant disruption due to the lack of hauliers.The British Retail Consortiumsaid festive disruption would be inevitableprogress is not made swtly. Furlough comes to an end The furlough scheme will shut down next week on September . One million Brits are set to still be on furlough when it comes to an end, experts have revealed. The Resolution Foundation projected one million employees are set to remain on the scheme right up until the last moment. Of those, “the majority” willto their jobs but hundreds of thousands will need to find new work in October. Since it launched last March, furlough has supported .million jobs by paying up to % of people’s wages - at a cost of nearly £billion to the taxpayer.But there are fears of a cost of living crisis - as energy bills are rising on October  and Universal Credit payments are being slashed from October .Covid winter A leading health expert said Coronavirus could resemble the common cold by spring as peopleaposs immunity to the virus is boosted by vaccines and exposure. But we still have a fierce winter ahead of us. Professor Sir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, himself admitted winter needs to pass as double jabbed Brits are still at risk of the virus. In the coming weeks we could see Covid hospitalisations in England rising to more than , a day, according to Government scientic advisors. This would be higher than the third lockdown peak. Worryingly for the Government, which has said that instructing people to work from home is only a “possibility”cases soar, SPI-M said there was “clear consensus” that the measure had kept the pandemic under control in recent months. Boris Johnson outlined his plan for tackling Covid over the winter months, a period when respiratory viruses thrive.Plan aposAapos revolves around booster jabs for the over-s and vaccinating - to -year-olds. While plan aposBapos, measures enforced could include mandatory vaccine passports, face masks in public places and encouraging people to work from home. Universal Credit A million and a half working people face being plunged into “hardship” this winter as their benefits are slashed by £ a week, at the end of this month. Citizens Advice research showed % of working claimants fear they will struggle to pay bills, fall into debt or be forced to sell belongings to make up for the £,-a-year shortfall in their income. About one in four working recipients - equivalent to , people - worry they will be unable to afford food or other basic necessities like toiletries.Even Boris Johnson could not sayhe could survive on the usual Universal Credit payment earlier this week.The Prime Minister was askedhe could get by on just £ a week - the standard UC allowance for a couple over  after UC is slashed next month.The temporary “uplt” was announced in March last year as the coronavirus pandemic hit Britain.Calls to extend the rise are mounting amid growing warnings of a winter living standards crisis.

A temporary visa scheme will see opportunities created for , HGV drivers and , poultry workers to take up employment in the UK until Christmas Eve. The move has been taken in a bid to keep supermarket shelves stocked with turkeys and toys as well as counter delivery dficulties at petrol stations. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the changes, with the visas available from next month, would ensure preparations remain on track for the festive season. Retailers had warned the Government that it had just  days to save Christmas from signicant disruption due to a shortfall of about , drivers in the freight sector.  Meanwhile military HGV test examiners are being drafted in to get , British truckers onto UK roads. The plan is to have more recruits trained to drive lorries over the next  weeks in time for Christmas to plug the HGV driver shortage which has left supermarket shelves bare. But Andrew Opie of the British Retail Consortium said it was not enough. He added: “The limit of , visas will do little to alleviate the current shortfall. “Supermarkets estimate they need at least , HGV drivers for their businesses to be able to operate at full capacity ahead of Christmas.” A million letters are also going out to all drivers who currently hold an HGV licence encouraging them back into the industry. But Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned hauliers yesterday this is a short-term fix and they must not rely on overseas labour. He said: “We are acting now but the industries must also play their part with salary increases to retain new drivers.”  Environment Secretary George Eustice added: “We are acting to alleviate what is a very tight labour market.” The visa scheme is also to be extended to , foreign poultry workers so shoppers can get their turkeys in time for Christmas. The Department for Education is joining the big recruitment drive with a £million scheme for Skills Bootcamps to train , of the drivers while the other , will take local adult education courses. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said: “We are taking action to tackle the shortage of drivers by removing barriers to help more people to launch new careers.” The three emergency services and the MoD will conduct driving tests for one another to free up other examiners. Food and Drink Federation boss Ian Wright said: “This is something UK food and drink manufacturers have asked for over the last few months. “This is a start but we need the Government to collaborate with industry and seek long term solutions.” Comment MORE ON Ministry of DefenceBritish Retail ConsortiumIan WrightBoris JohnsonNadhim ZahawiGrant ShappsEducationPoliticsSupermarketsSunday Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Barratt chief David Thomas, , picked up £.million in bonuses on top of his £, pay, the company’s annual report reveals. It takes the keen fisherman’s pay and perks tally to £million since starting as CEO in . Yet leaseholders in Barratt homes face paying out tens of thousands to fix defects in the wake of the Grenfell fire which killed  in West London in . IT worker Steve Day, , got a £, bill to replace flammable cladding on his Barratt build at Royal Artillery Quays in Greenwich, South East London. He said: “These huge payouts are a kick in the teeth when so many leaseholders are staring down the barrel at financial ruin.”  Steve is among leaseholders liable for a £million repair bill. Barratt – with £million pre-tax profits in the year to June – is covering £million-worth. Dave Richards, from End Our Cladding Scandal, said: “Remedial funds set aside by Barratt are nowhere near enough. To rub salt into leaseholders’ wounds, David Thomas is paid huge sums running a company which is failing many customers. We speak regularly with Barratt leaseholders. Some face bankruptcy, others are delaying families, pensioners are going back to work to pay for the repairs. “All tell us they feel completely trapped. It is high time Barratt did the right thing by finally making homes safe.” Barratt has generated pre-tax profits of £billion since Grenfell – paying out £.billion to shareholders. Married Mr Thomas lives on a £.million estate in Purley, South London. Papers show his £.million included a £.million bonus and £.million performance share payout. He also got £.million in  and £.million last year. The firm says cladding at Royal Artillery met regulations at the time. A spokesman said: “We don’t think leaseholders should pay for remediation and we are helping building owners to find solutions to support leaseholders in buildings we built. “We have set aside or spent £million and will update this amount as work progresses and reviews are completed.” Comment MORE ON BarrattDavid ThomasSunday Mirror,callToAction:ltpgtGet weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emaillt pgt,buttonText:,contentId:,newsletterImage:https:i-prod.mirror article.ece ALTERNATES sd _AlisonHeaderFinal.png,endpointUrl:https:response.pure interface list.php,profile:Reach_Mirror,isPureNewsLetter:true,pureMailingListId:Mirror - Alisons Newsletter,isDoubleOptIn:,newsletterSiteName:Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get weekly highlights from Mirror editor Alison Phillips direct to your emailInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

He said: “When I realized that for me to spend  to see a . hour movie and enjoy popcorn and a soda, it would take me that long at work just to do that. “It got me thinking about how maybe I didn’t need to get the popcorn and soda, and maybe should just get one or the other.”Maths-Whizz is a super clever virtual maths tutor which delivers interactive games, lessons and exercises for five to  year olds.To see how good it is at transforming home learning for parents, weaposve negotiated an exclusive % off price to make it £. for the first month.Seeyou like it first and sign up to a -day no-obligation free trial by clicking here.

His stepdad said the war veteran questioned whether the sacrice by thousands of British troops was worth itLuke Monckton at his passing out parade with parents Dave and AudraBySean Rayment:,  Sep Updated:,  Sep The family of an Afghanistan war veteran who took his own le say their son was deeply troubled by the country’s ­recent fall to the Taliban. Former Royal Engineer Luke Monckton, a dad of five, killed himself just days after the insurgents seized back control last month. His stepdad David Savory, also an Army veteran, said Luke questioned whether the sacrice by ­thousands of British troops killed and wounded in the -year war was worth it. Dave told the Sunday People: “The fall of the country to the Taliban deeply affected Luke. Just days before he died he said to his mum and me, “Why did we bother  It was a waste of le.’ I could tell it was something that troubled him.”  Luke, , is believed to be among eight veterans to have committed suicide – three of them last week – following the US-led withdrawal from the country and he is the first of them to be named. He is also thought to be the st Army suicide this year. The family suspects Luke, who died on August , was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder – made worse because family friend Connor Ray, also in the Royal Engineers, had been killed in Afghanistan in . Luke, from Boorley Green, Hants, joined the Army aged  in  and served as a sapper for about eight years in the Royal Engineers. In , he deployed to Afghanistan and was responsible for building ­forward operating bases, often in ­isolated Taliban-controlled areas. The work was dangerous and ­dficult and most days, Luke and his comrades came under fire.  Dave, , who was in the Royal Green Jackets for  years, said: “Luke loved the Army and didn’t really want to leave. “But the Army was having a big impact on his family le. He had missed the births of two of his first three children and he said that he wanted to be more of a dad, which is why he left. “But he missed Army le. He tried to rejoin a couple of years ago but there was a waiting list. “He became a HGV driver and went to work in the Co-op. He was ­doing well. He had a good salary, a nice home and a lovely family.” But Luke was a changed person when he ed from Afghanistan.  Dave said: “He never really spoke about what happened. He was essentially a closed book on that. “I know that he was under fire a lot of the time and the events which took place out there had a deep impact on him. But like a lot of veterans he kept a lot of what happened to himself. “He did have problems when he came home, he couldn’t settle very well and he struggled with his demons. Looking back, he was probably suffering from PTSD. Anything which might make somebody a little fed-up would leave him very, very down. He refused therapy and just wanted to get on.” Luke – father to Jenson, , Jared, , Hallie, five, Harleigh, four, and Jacob, two – was separated from his we at the time of his death and sharing a flat with his older brother, Adam. He was found by Adam, mum Audra and Dave. They tried to resuscitate him but he was already dead. Dave said: “The effect on us has been devastating. We have ­decided to speak publicly about this because we don’t want anyone  to go through what we have been through. We knew Luke was feeling a bit low but had no idea that he might take his own le.” Family friend Helen Mcilfatrick, , of New Brighton, Merseyside, said: “Luke was very proud of his ­service but the way veterans are treated by the Government is disgusting. He was clearly suffering.” Helen set up a Just Giving page and hopes to raise £, to help Luke’s family with funeral costs.  Following the Sunday People Save Our Soldiers campaign, the Ministry of Defence has announced it will start recording veteran suicides. But former Army warrant officer Jim Wilde of the pressure group Veterans United Against Suicide warned it was just a single step in the right direction. He said: “There needs to be liaison with the very people directly affected – veterans.”The shambolic pull-out from Afghanistan – which US President Joe Biden insisted on sticking to despite Afghan troops being overrun by the Taliban – is feared to have triggered the new wave of suicides.Former Veterans’ minister Johnny Mercer MP, who served in Afghanistan, said: “My thoughts and prayers are with those families who have been bereaved last week. The truth is that the debacle of leaving Afghanistan has proved extremely dficult for many of us who actually fought there. I did manage to establish Op COURAGE during my time as Minister, which should be pulling together all NHS mental health services. “I would urge fellow veterans finding these days and nights tough to reach out to them.” A Government spokesperson said: “Every suicide is a tragedy and our thoughts are with the family and friends of Luke Monckton at this dficult time. “Veterans can access specialist ­support from Op COURAGE. “We announced a new reporting method for veteran suicides in England and Wales to further understand where there is need for dedicated services.” To help Luke’s family, go to justgiving crowdfunding lukemonckton* If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

Nearly four in tenliving in Birmingham have installed CCTV and alarms at home to curb their fears about safety. Just under halfof people living in London would feel much safer with a police station in their neighbourhood - and just over a quarter in the capital would even consider legally owning a gun or kne for self-protection.  In comparison, Sheffield, Southampton, and Edinburgh came out as the top three safest cities to live in, with less than one in ten adults in the Scottish capital experiencing any sort of crime. Half of those in Southampton would recommend living in the city to friends, due to feeling so secure there. The stats emerged in a study to mark the launch of the new series of crime drama Murdertown on Crime+Investigation.  A spokesman said: Despite being popular living spots, it’s surprising to see some of the most common cities deemed unsafe - particularly the likes of Cardf, London and Birmingham.  “There are clear concerns of activity from the British public that they could be a victim or witness a crime when walking around at night or even in during the daytime. “The new TV series will aim to uncover the most shocking murders in the UK and examine the impact they had on the cities around them.” Norwich and Leicester complete the top five safest cities, while Bristol and Leeds come further down the chart, ranking th and th. Researchers found Londoners are most likely to have experienced crime in the capital- an increase of  percent since . Most common wrongdoings include unprovoked acts of violence , fraudand muggings . And over a quarter of adultsin Cardf have witnessed a crime - up from  percent three years ago.  Almost a thirdadmitted they were a victim of crime themselves, compared to just  percent of adults living in the Welsh city in . Of these illegal acts, home break-ins were most common , followed by fraudand car theft- indicating crime activity has increased since  and during the pandemic. But research, commissioned via OnePoll, found overall  percent of adults would remain in the area they live in as they feel safe when in their own home. And to make their property safer to live in,  percent have installed smart lights that turn on when they’re outdoors, and  percent have added in extra locks around the house. Other measures added to make their home secure include security cameras, growing big hedges around the property and buying a guard dog. Outside of the home, one in five respondents feels safe most of the time - but six in ten won’t go out after dark unless they have to.  And one fth would feel safer in their citythey didn’t know of so many attacks or break-ins nearby, while  percent can’t help but pay attention to local gossip. For a resounding four in ten adults, a bigger police presence would make them feel more protected, while a third want more CCTV and one quarter want a local police station. When it comes to law enforcement, more than half of British adults do not feel the police are able to keep their area safe. And  percent feel women in particular are being let down by the police following the Sarah Everard case. The spokesman for Murdertown added: “The UK police force play a vital role in keeping our cities safe and ensure people feel comfortable to go about their normal lives without causing any issues. “Of course, that’s easier said than done when staffing levels can be an issue, and some cities have such high crime rates to contend with.”There will be more stories unveiled in Murdertown’s new ten-part series which premieres on Crime+Investigation on th September at pm.TOP  SAFEST CITIES TO LIVE IN THE UK...Edinburgh Southampton Sheffield Norwich Leicester Manchester Newcastle Cambridge Liverpool Glasgow Bristol Leeds Birmingham London CardfMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON CCTVCrimeCity of CardfSouth Wales PoliceCity of Edinburgh\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Since then, he has been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, and is also a carer for his partner, , who has visual impairment, and their three-year-old daughter Amelia.Are you worried about the Universal Credit cut  Get in touch at webnews@mirror The couple are now trying to juggle their household budget to make sure they have enough money put by to heat their home and put food on the table, as well as try to give their daughter a good Christmas. He said the uplt meant they could provide extra activities with their daughter while her nursery was closed, and provided an extra security blanket as they endured lockdown. He said: It just enabled us not to worry too much about the bills, it took the pressure off. Now we are going to be £ a month worse off. Are we still going to be able to do the things we want to do with Amelia, and heat our home, especially with the energy crisis going on  Are we going to be able to get the food we need, and pay the bills, especially with the winter coming  It certainly is a worry, and I hope it doesnapost get to that. My partner is writing lists and making sure we save enough money to pay for this bill and that bill, and have enough money for food and Christmas. More than a third of the almost six million people on Universal Credit nationally are in work. The system was rolled out by the government to replace a series of other benefits, bringing together support for income with housing and childcare costs into a single payment.The £ a week uplt was brought in at the start of the coronavirus pandemic in  for a year and was extended in March this year, but is due to end by October. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has shown no signs of reversing plans for the £ reduction, suggesting it could only be keptpaid for by tax hikes.In comments made during his US trip, he said he had “every sympathy” for those toughing it out on benefits, but that the £- billion required to make the additional weekly payments permanent would have to “come out of some people’s pockets”. The government has said the uplt was always meant to be temporary, and one minister said the reduction equalled two hoursapos work for those in employment.The cut also comes as Boris Johnson refused to say whether he could live on the usual Universal Credit payment. The Prime Minister was askedhe could get by on just £ a week - the standard UC allowance for a couple over  after UC is slashed next month. It came as he again snubbed calls to maintain the £-a-week rise for six million of the poorest families - despite mounting warnings of looming hardship and poverty.

Black Labrador Bonnie was left in searing pain when a spider - thought to be a  widow or similar - sank its fangs into her face while she was out on a walk. The -month-old pup was rushed for emergency treatment in Gateshead after her eye became so swollen it closed shut. Owners Lisa and Nick Bennett, who were visiting family, were terried that Bonnieaposs throat and windpipe might close up from the reaction.They searched online for urgent animal treatment and found Vets Now emergency clinic in Gateshead - where they took the increasingly distressed pooch, Chronicle Live reports. Bonnie also experienced vomiting and diarrhoea on her way. Attendant vet Konrad ran tests and concluded Bonnie had been bitten by a spider, and hooked her up to a drip. The bite happened five days previously while the couple were walking their pet near Redditch in Worcestershire. Konrad gave Bonnie an injection, put her under observation, and waited for the swelling to go down. Bonnieaposs condition improved quickly after the treatment and she was soon well enough to be reunited with her relieved family. Lisa said: “It was a terrible shock to see her face swell up and it happened so quickly. “Being so far from home made it even worse — you just feel so vulnerable when your pet is in distress. “Bonnie is a very intelligent dog and she was clearly aware that something was wrong. “She kept trying to use her paw to wipe and scratch away the swelling, which made it more upsetting to see. “We assumed it was a reaction to something she’d eaten or possibly a snake bite, but it never occurred to us she’d been bitten by a spider. “Konrad and the team at Vets Now said it can be several days before a spider bite starts affecting a dog — and that’s when we realised. “Five days before all this drama happened, we’d been walking Bonnie and our other black lab Benson near our house when she gave a yelp and came limping back to us. “We checked her over, couldn’t see anything untoward and just assumed she’d maybe stood on a thorn. “Then she went off again and seemed totally fine. “But what we know now is that the yelp was almost certainly a sign she’d been bitten.”Senior vet nurse Ashley Wemple said it’s very rare for pets to be bitten by spiders.She added: “This is not the type of case we see every day. Butyour dog gets bitten by an insect or even a snake, it can be dficult to see any evidence because the bite is often covered by their fur. “Symptoms can include swelling, itchiness and irritation of the skin and, in severe cases, an allergic reaction. “It can take hours — or, as in Bonnie’s case, days — for this to happen. “Butthere is a bad reaction or swelling then time really is of the essence, and you should seek help straight away. “Nick and Lisa did the right thing calling us when they did —they had delayed, the consequences could have been very serious. “Bonnie was such a friendly and good-natured dog. We were all delighted to see her go back to Lisa and Nick after treatment with her tail wagging.” After three days there was no longer any trace of swelling on Bonnieaposs face - and she made a full recovery. Lisa said: “The service we got was brilliant from the moment we rang — and Konrad and his colleagues were so incredibly kind and patient, not just with Bonnie but with us as well. We’re really grateful to them for looking after her, and us, so well.” Comment MORE ON AnimalsSpidersFalse widow spidersBig DogsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

What do you think  Let us know in the comments below  Independent SAGE, a group of scientists set up to mirror the Government advisory group, has said “sensible protections” are needed to prevent a surge triggering another winter lockdown. It has issued a nine-point plan including demanding the reintroduction of mandatory mask wearing indoors, more financial support for people to self isolate and the right to work from home where possible for all workers. Prof Stephen Reicher said: “Last year the Government failed to heed SAGE warnings in September and let the pandemic run so far out of control that by November, severe restrictions were necessary.

Up and down the UK drivers have been resisting government calls not to panic by heading out to their local garage for a tank top-up. Fearful that disrupted supply lines will leave them unable to fill up, many motorists have been stuck in long queues for hours, battling those others who had a similar idea. Industry professionals have said that while the queues may look dramatic, there is not too much cause for concern when it comes to actual petrol supply. Less than  of the , filling stations in the UK have been forced to close, the Daily Mail reports. What do you think of the panic buyers  Have your say in the comments  Around  BP garages have shut completely and a maximum of  have run out of at least one type of fuel. A apossmall numberapos of Tesco refilling stations have also been impacted, said Esso owner ExxonMobil, which runs the sites. President of the AA Edmund King reiterated on Saturday that there is plenty of fuel at the source and no need to stock up. The good news is you can only really fill up once - youaposve got to use the fuel, so this should be a short-term thing, he told BBC Breakfast. Itaposs not like the fuel crises in the past when the supplier was hit by strikes, etc. So, once people have filled up, they wonapost travel more than they normally travel, so this strain on the system should ease up in the next few days. Concerns about petrol supplies were triggered by supply chain issues caused, in part, by the shortage of heavy goods vehicledrivers. In a bid to fill some of the vacancies caused, in no small part, by Brexit, the government is planning to offer short term visas for EU drivers.  Weaposre looking at temporary measures to avoid any immediate problems, but any measures we introduce will be very strictly time limited, a spokeswoman for Johnsonaposs Downing Street office said in a statement. Like countries around the world we are suffering from a temporary Covid-related shortage of drivers needed to move supplies around the country. The UKaposs Road Haulage Associationsays Britain is facing a shortage of some , drivers, a result of workers leaving the industry, Brexit and Covid-, which put a stop to driver training and testing for about a year. WARNING: The following embedded tweets contain strong language some may find offensiveThe government is reportedly considering granting entry to up to , foreign drivers into Britain on short-term visas, a measure that logistics companies and retailers have demanded for months but which the government had previously ruled out. Brian Madderson, the chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association which represents independent fuel retailers, said he expected the problem to continue for a while longer. I think this situation is going to get worse before it gets better, he told Sky News. EG Group, which runs  forecourts across Britain, said on Friday it would impose a purchase limit of  poundsper customer for fuel due to the unprecedented customer demand. From early on Saturday, motorists began queuing outside filling stations and some forecourts closed as fuel ran out.  I was out on my bike ... and came past my BP garage and it was chaos, Merriman said. As soon as the message gets out there might be a fuel shortage, people understandably react. Police across the country reported congestion caused by motorists waiting in line, and urged people not to contact them about the problems the traffic was causing. Britain, the worldaposs fth-largest economy, is also grappling with a spike in Europe  an natural gas costs causing soaring energy prices and a potential food supply crunch. At least one bust-up has broken out on the countryaposs forecourts, as a clash broke out at a busy petrol station in Portsmouth, Hants, where drivers had flocked to a Shell station. Two groups of men were aposscreamingapos at each other before one group chased another fleeing in a van - hurling stones at the vehicle, according to a witness. The ugly scenes shocked onlookers at a forecourt in the Hilsea area of the city at around .am. A witness said: People were queuing throughout the night. Pumps are almost dry.

This Is Me, Keala Settle’s stirring and emotional classic from The Greatest Showman, includes the lyrics “I know that there’s a place for us, For we are glorious”. And glorious they were as TV stars Fearne Cotton and Kirsty Gallacher looked on in support and admiration. But for Maisie, a very special member of the audience was sister Cecily, . She donated the bone marrow which helped Maisie thrive and overcome the latest cancer onslaught. Having fought the disease since she was seven, Maisie was struck again just before the pandemic hit. And Cecily would be the key to winning this phase of the challenge. Now , Maisie says: “Cecily did an amazing thing. When I found out I had relapsed, that was really tough. But there is more to le than cancer. I try to have a positive attitude and take one day at a time.” Cecily was nervous about the procedure and admits: “I didn’t enjoy it but, of course, I would do it because it was for my sister.” Maisie, from Northampton, is in remission and the sisters hope their story will help raise money during Childhood Cancer Awareness month – as well as spread the message that cancer doesn’t have to define anyone. The London gala for charity Young Lives vs Cancer helped raise £,. Maisie brought the house down with a speech and group performance of This Is Me.TV and radio star Fearne, , was so moved she posted a message on Instagram, saying: “The best bit of the night for me was watching a young lady called Maisie sing for us alongside some other young people who have had cancer.They hadn’t rehearsed in person, only over Zoom, but they totally smashed it.” Maisie says: “She was so lovely, really friendly and down to earth. “She told me I was a great singer – coming from her, that felt amazing!” Young Lives vs Cancer has offered great support – providing somewhere to stay for Maisie’s parents as the youngster twice had gruelling two-month bouts of chemotherapy. The charity also enlisted another group to enable Maisie to attend school remotely via a remarkable AI robot that sat in her classroom seat. It allowed her to keep up to speed with lessons and speak to pals at break times. It was back in January  that parents Sarah, , and Pete, , were told Maisie had leukaemia. She had complained of an aching shoulder and stomach pains. Sarah says: “Maisie was a typical fit, healthy seven-year-old. I was expecting to be told she needed appendix surgery. Instead they told us she had leukaemia. “It just didn’t make sense at all.”  There was no time to waste and the family was told a waiting ambulance would take Maisie from their local Northampton General Hospital to a specialist ward at Queen’s Medical Centre in Nottingham,  miles away. Two months of chemo began and the parents were placed in Home-From-Home accommodation just a stone’s throw away. Cecily stayed with grandparents and visited when possible. Sarah – who, like husband Pete, works in human resources – goes on: “It was terrying and frightening. We were completely sleep-deprived and entering this whole new world we’d never imagined being part of. We were told it was serious but treatable. But she was very poorly with a low immune system. The hardest day was when she had to get measured for a wheelchair and a wig. “Those were two of the most shocking things. As it happens we didn’t need the wheelchair and it was eight months before her hair came out – and Maisie took everything in her stride. We’d say, ‘It’s fine. We’ve just got to get through this rubbish bit’.” After two months the remaining treatment was mainly managed at home.  Chemo was administered by nurses, through a Hickman line in her chest. She ed to school, though even a mild temperature would put her back in hospital for four days at a time. Maisie’s treatment finally finished in the summer of . But by the end of  she started complaining of leg pain. Shortly before Christmas, almost four years since her first diagnosis, Maisie relapsed. Her leukaemia had ed. On New Year’s Eve she began another two-month round of chemo back in Nottingham. “It was that awful sense of deja vu,” Sarah says. “But we did it the first time and we would do it again.” This time doctors said Maisie would also need a stem cell transplant to stop the leukaemia from ing. Cecily had a one in four chance of being a match.  Her apprehension was understandable. Cecily said: “I have never stayed in hospital or had an operation before, so I didn’t really want to do it but I couldn’t not, so I sucked it up and went ahead.” It was March  – the week of the first lockdown – when Maisie, Cecily and Sarah headed to London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital after isolating for weeks together to avoid Cecily getting sick. Sarah says: “I called our consultant and said, ‘Are you sure this is the best time to wipe out a child’s immune system – heading into a pandemic  He told me we didn’t have a choice. Which kind of helped because we just had to press on.” Cecily had bone marrow extracted on April  and watched through a hospital window as the stem cells were delivered into Maisie’s bloodstream. Cecily says: “It was surreal.” For two months Sarah and Maisie stayed in the ward, with mum venturing outside once a week for six minutes to receive fresh clothes from Pete. Maisie and her mum whiled away the hours on TikTok, family quizzes and singing. Sarah adds: “We’d literally cross off the days in that room. The nurses were amazing but it did feel a bit like prison.” Get the latest news straight to your inbox with our daily newsletter One day, she filmed Maisie’s rendition of Rise Up – Andra Day’s hit that became a message of hope for people facing tough times. On that note, the gala was a signicant milestone – and helping the charity is important to the family. Sarah says: “Maisie has been unlucky to be very ill but that’s just a small part of who she is and just a small part of who we are as a family. So many people travel long distances for treatment and that’s why support of Young Lives vs Cancer is so vital. It’s so much harder to cope, and these families have enough to cope with already, so they need that support.” Meanwhile, Maisie hasn’t made a huge fuss about things. And of Cecily, while realising they now share an extra-special bond, she says: “I guess we’re like a lot of sisters – good friends with a few arguments along the way!” And Sarah adds: “Maisie’s enormously resilient and doesn’t think anything bad has ever happened to her. Our children are so much more than their cancer.” For more information or cancer support, visit younglivesvscancer.org.uk Comment MORE ON Kirsty GallacherFearne CottonThis Is MeGreat Ormond Street HospitalNew YearThe Greatest ShowmanHospitalsImmune systemCancerLeukaemia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Thousands of people Brits are reporting symptoms that could be easily mistaken for Covid. Negative results show they are suffering instead with a harmless but nasty common cold infection.Dr Philippa Kaye, a GP at a London practice, told BBC Newsbeat : Weaposve actually been seeing a rise in the number of coughs and colds and viral infections.We are mixing in a way that we havenapost been mixing over the past  months. The spike in viral infections come as the public s to normality -with less stress now on mask wearing and social distancing as Brits head back to work or school. New arrivals at universities also face a spike in Fresheraposs Flu - an increase in viral symptoms as students bring viruses from their own towns to their lecture halls, Wales Online reports.Rebecca London, , from Bournemouth told the BBC she caught a cold at a festival and it was aposthe worst everapos. She said: I barely slept, Iaposd wake up in the night just coughing, a constantly runny nose and feeling so tired. The cold lasted more than a week, she said. Noor Hashmi, , another student, told the BBC: Normally Iaposm still able to go about my day, but this one left me with muscle fatigue, a lost voice and headache that meant Iaposve just stayed indoors. Dr Philippa advises people experiencing symptoms of Covid - like a new cough, fever, loss of sense of taste or smell - to take a PCR test. Cold symptoms can be treated with rest, fluids and over-the-counter painkillers, she adds. Following Covid prevention measures - like wearing masks and social distancing - means weaposve missed the chance to develop immunity to coughs, cold and flu viruses for two years. As your body has not had the opportunity to fight the illnesses, when they reach you the symptoms can be worse.Dr Ron Eccles, Emeritus Professor at Cardf Universityaposs School of Biosciences told Patient.info : If youaposve been exposed to a particular virus before, you may not develop any symptoms at all, because your immune system has been primed to fight off the infection.Itaposs the same process that means you usually only catch chickenpox once. With common colds we generally donapost have such a strong immune response and therefore we probably donapost get lelong immunity to a particular virus, he adds. However, we may get a milder responsewe are exposed to that virus again. The NHSaposs big three symptoms for Covid are a high temperature which leaves your back or chest feeling hot, a new, continuous cough, and a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste. If you experience any of these symptoms then get a PCR test and self-isolate until you get your test result.

Here, some of next Sunday’s inspiring competitors reveal why it’s such a cherished race for them… This time, I want to get a medal In , Claire Lomas won fans across the world when she completed the London Marathon after  days. The former horse rider, who was paralysed from the chest down in a riding accident in , wore a robotic suit to take part in the race, raising £, for Spinal Research. But this year, Claire – who was awarded an MBE in  and was one of just  people to be given a Spirit of London Award, guaranteeing her place in this year’s Marathon – is determined to take home a medal.

Iaposve loved training alongside my DNA twin When Vicky Lawrence and Elliott Brock cross the finish line at the London Marathon, few spectators will know the bond the two runners have. In , physiotherapist Elliott, , donated his bone marrow to save Vicky’s le after the eight-year- old was diagnosed with severe aplastic anaemia.  At the time of the le-saving op, in Vicky’s home town of Birmingham, the pair were complete strangers. Vicky’s family wrote numerous letters to Elliott to say how grateful they were, but it wasn’t until Vicky started studying for her A-levels that he finally replied and they became firm friends. Vicky, who is now  and a third-year medical student at Newcastle University, first suggested they take on the London Marathon to raise money for Anthony Nolan UK two years ago.  Dad-of-two Elliott, who lives in Colchester, Essex, said: “I foolishly agreed, but have loved the training and can’t wait to run alongside my DNA twin. “There’s something poetic about Vicky getting me off my backside and healthy after I saved her le all those years ago.”To sponsor Vicky and Elliott, go to justgiving fundraising victoria-lawrence Iaposm doing it for Wilma Nicknamed Iron Man, Andy Farrer really is a hero who has superhuman strength.

Andy, who never trains for his runs and cracks open a beer on the starting line, already holds the Guinness World Record for doing the London Marathon while carrying an ironing board and iron – and is keen to repeat it. Since he started running, the Sainsbury’s meat counter worker has raised around £, for charity and is aiming to raise £, for VICTA next weekend.  Andy, from Portrush in Northern Ireland, said: “If you’re holding an ironing board, people ask questions.

Flora also arranged for three-time London Marathon winner Paula Radclfe to help Lillie out by giving her some training tips via Zoom.

The results show that it’s Londoners who have the biggest appetite for heat:  per cent of those in the capital said they like their food to be nice and spicy or even to feel their mouths on fire. The Scots and West Midlanders are runners-up in their love of the burn, at  and  per cent respectively. But spice is off the menu in Yorkshire: around one in five people declared that they prefer their food mild – the highest number of any region surveyed. Hot on their heelswere those in the East of England. The survey also revealed the gap between people’s estimation of their own region’s appetite for spice and the reality. Residents of Northern Ireland were widest off the mark, guessing that only  per cent would like fiery food, whereas the true figure was  per cent. In contrast,  per cent of those in the North West thought their population would love serious spice, but it was actually a mere  per cent. London and the West Midlands came out top when people were asked which region they thought would have the greatest penchant for spicy food, and they were broadly right. But those in the South West were wrongly assumed to have the least tolerance for the tingle factor.

Presenting duo Ant and Dec have left people making all kinds of attempts to pronounce another location after snapping a photo on their way to the I’m a Celeb filming spot.The pair once struggled to pronounce Gwrych Castle, which is near Abergele, where the show was filmed last year, Chill reports.And en route to the venue where the show will be filmed for , the presenters stopped off at Mynyddislwyn, which left UK fans pondering the correct pronunciation. Even Ant and Dec looked baffled - but that may be because they were  miles out of their way after taking a wrong turn at Newport.  So here’s all you - and Ant and Dec - need to know about Mynyddislwyn and how to pronounce it like a local with a quick Welsh lesson.How do you say it Don’t stumble at the first hurdle - the ‘y’ in the first part of the word. It’s pronounced like aposughapos. aposDdapos in Welsh is classed as its own letter and is pronounced aposthapos. Another confusion comes with aposwyapos that makes an aposooapos. But let’s make it easy for you - put it all together and you get mun-ith-is-loo-in.Wondering where to eat, drink or visit for your next UK holiday  At Chill we help you decide where to go and stay next with hundreds of recommendations right on your doorstep.

For the latest must-have travel news follow us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter.What does it mean anyway Mynydd means mountain in Welsh and the parish is often translated as aposmountain ashapos or aposmountain below the groveapos. There is actually a place called Mountain Ash not too far away, so donapost get them mixed up.Where is it exactly Mynyddislwyn is a small parish between Ystrad Mynach and Crumlin and while technically in Monmouthshire, itaposs more aligned to Caerphilly. So people there claim it as theirs, whatever the internet might say.And what about Gwrych Castle  Any help on how to say that According to researcher at Gwrych Castle Preservation Trust, Rhŷn Williams, the impressive Welsh castle is in fact pronounced, Goo-rreech. He said the stress on the aposWapos part is paramount. *That’s ‘welcome back’ in Welsh!

The family live in a -bed former care home over four floors in Morecambe, Lancashire, and often update their followers with videos on YouTube. In the latest offering, Sue, , started by showing off the childrenaposs play area at the front of the mega property which has swings and a slide. Itaposs also where the kids store their bikes, and the family hopes to soon buy a plastic storage facility to put them in, she explained. I think thataposs going to be next on the to do list, the busy mum - who runs a bakery alongside husband Noel,  - told the camera. Sue then walked across the articial lawn in the back garden where the family boasts a collection of luxurious sun loungers, a hot tub, fire pit and bar and adjoining seating area. She said they are planning to buy a gazebo to put the hot tub in so they can continue to enjoy it now that autumn has arrived. I have to say [the hot tub] has just been the best thing ever, admitted Sue. The kids all get so much enjoyment out of that.  Sue and Noel - who famously donapost rely on any benefits to support their brood - currently have  of their kids living under their roof, with many sharing bedrooms. The two oldest - Chris, , and Sophie,  - have previously flown the nest. Their th child, Alfie, was sadly stillborn in .  Pointing to the grey seating area with scatter cushions, the mum said: I just love this area, itaposs so nice. You can sit here with a nice cup of coffee in the evening and just chill out when the kids have gone to bed. But her favourite spot is the bar. This is probably one of my most favourite things in the garden along with the hot tub. Itaposs just brilliant, said Sue.  In a previous video last year, Noel had explained how he had built it with the help of daughter Chloe, , and son James, , during the Covid lockdown. Itaposs just been so brilliant. We just love it, gushed Sue. Nicknamed aposThe Lockdown Barapos, it has been decorated with a wind chime and signs, including one that says: I wine because they wine!  They also have a barbecue and pizza oven for outdoor dinners. Sue explained: This was Aldiaposs pizza oven and it is really really good. Weaposve had so many nights with the kids making their own pizzas and things so thataposs been a massive hit. Earlier this year, Sue and Noel began a major DIY project, in which they transformed their garden, including adding an articial lawn which they vacuum to keep clean.

As well as meeting Emma, Kate also chatted with fellow British US Open champions Joe Salisbury, who won the menaposs doubles title with American Rajeev Ram, and Gordon Reid and Alfie Hewett, the menaposs wheelchair doubles champions. There was an awkward moment when Kate first arrived as she was unsure how to congratulate the group.She said: Are we shaking hands  I donapost want to break your training bubbles.Itaposs really awkward, you donapost know quite whether to do it. It is the same with face masks.You never know whether to hug people, congratulate them or shake hands. But amazing, guys honestly, congratulations.Emma, who is now ranked nd in the world, became the first qualier to win one of the four majors when she claimed the US Open womenaposs singles title earlier this month. She also became the first British woman in  years to win a Grand Slam title, when she breezed past Canadian Leylah Fernandez in straight sets.After her victory, Kate took to Twitter to send a rare personal tweet saying : Huge congratulations @EmmaRaducanu on your stunning performances and historic Grand Slam victory! Incredible –we are all so proud of you. @leylahfernandez well done on your amazing achievements at this year’s #USOpen, it’s been a pleasure to watch. CThe Queen also said it was a remarkable achievement at such a young age and added she was an inspiration for future tennis players. In a personal message to Emma, she said: I send my congratulations to you on your success in winning the United States Open Tennis Championships. It is a remarkable achievement at such a young age, and is testament to your hard work and dedication. I have no doubt your outstanding performance, and that of your opponent Leylah Fernandez, will inspire the next generation of tennis players. Raducanu shot into the spotlight with a surprise y run to the second week of Wimbledon - her Grand Slam debut tournament earlier this summer. And even before the tournament, it appears that Kate and husband Prince William were fans of the young Brit. In a tweet from July, the couple made their predictions of who would win Wimbledon and said: Unbiased prediction to win it: @andy_murray and @EmmaRaducanu #Wimbledon.

The “brilliant” -year-old had taken over a Year One class only shortly before her murder nine days ago. Lisa Williams, headteacher at Rushey Green Primary School in Lewisham, south London, said all the pupils and staff were devastated. She added: “Sabina was a brilliant teacher. She was kind, caring and absolutely dedicated to her pupils.” Sabina’s body was found in Cator Park, near her home in Kidbrooke, south east London, after she failed to arrive for a Friday night date at a pub. Yesterday a child’s white T-shirt with the message, “Thank you for being my teacher” hand-written in felt-tip pen was among tributes left at the park.  It is understood Ms Williams visited each class to talk to pupils, with educational psychologists also offering help. The Duchess of Cambridge yesterday spoke of her grief for Sabina on her official Twitter feed. She wrote: “I am saddened by the loss of another innocent young woman on our streets. My thoughts are with Sabina’s family and friends.”  An unnamed teacher at the -pupil school told a local newspaper: “It’s hard for teachers to reassure children while they are themselves consumed with grief. “The Year Two pupils who she had last year in Year One will be the most upset – and their parents.” Sabina, from Bedfordshire, studied at the University of Greenwich before completing her PGCE teacher training last year at her local university. Her colleague, one of  staff at the school, said: “The first anyone knew was when we arrived on Monday.  “It’s awful enough when someone dies – this is so much worse. It’s impossible to comprehend. We were sitting beside her on Friday… then this.” Police yesterday searched drains near to where Sabina died and also want to trace a balding man seen close by at the time on CCTV. Revealing he was holding a “red reflective item”, they said they are keeping an open mind as to whether it may have been used in her murder. Det Chief Insp Neil John said: “People may recall this man carrying a red reflective object, and possibly trying to conceal it up his sleeve.” On Friday night hundreds of mourners, including parents and pupils from Sabina’s school, gathered for a candlelight vigil in her memory.  Her sister, Jebina Yasmin Islam, broke down in tears as she told them: “I’ve lost my caring, beautul sister.” Sabina’s death has sparked fresh anger over women’s safety, six months after the murder of Sarah Everard, , by Met police officer Wayne Couzens.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Kate Middleton, Duchess of CambridgeEducationMurderSchools\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Symptoms of the virus are extremely similar to those of a regular cold, particularly for those who have been double jabbed.Vaccinated people who contract the virus are likely to experience a runny nose, sore throat and sneezing, the Daily Record reported. But now, new research from the ZOE Covid Symptom study, developed by Kingaposs College London, has found that thereaposs one symptom that can help tell the dference.Data shows that loss of smellor loss of taste is still one of the most important predictors of testing positive for coronavirus rather than a regular cold.Researchers say you can check your sense of smell easily at home by snfing scented foods or products, or noticing whether familiar foods start to lose their flavour or taste strange. Millions of people have been logging their symptoms, tests and vaccines on the UK ZOE COVID Symptom Study app since it was launched.

A well-run country would not have queues at the fuel pumps, empty shelves in supermarkets and firms unable to source basic goods. Thanks to this Government’s incompetence and complacency, firms have been walloped by rising energy bills, a shortage of CO and a transportation crisis. And that is before you add in the disruption from Covid and economic pain caused by rising living costs. Boris Johnson has been in denial about the chaos caused by these multiple crises. An emergency is looming, but there has been no emergency planning. The Prime Minister likes to boast about Global Britain – but on his watch, we are in danger of becoming Broken Britain. Keir moment  Next week Keir Starmer will finally address the Labour conference in person. The pandemic has been doubly frustrating for the Labour leader, dominating the news, making it harder for the Opposition to be heard and preventing Sir Keir from properly introducing himself to the public. This why so much is riding on his leader’s speech this Wednesday. Sir Keir inherited a broken and ided party which had suffered its fourth election defeat in a row. Since then he has made steady,slow, progress in turning around Labour’s fortunes. The party is in a better place than it was two years ago, but Labour’s rehabilitation is not yet complete. That work must continue at the conference in Brighton. It is time the party stopped talking to itself and began a conversation about how Labour can transform lives and build a better Britain.

The UK has been plagued by a number of shortages in recent weeks, brought on by a shortage of HGV drivers.BPaposs head of UK retail Hanna Hofer has said it is important the government understands the urgency of the situation, which she described as bad, very bad, ITV News reports.She added that BP had two-thirds of normal forecourt stock levels required for smooth operations and the level is declining rapidly. Here we take a look at which oil companies have faced petrol station closures, and the reason for the fuel shortage. Which petrol stations have closed   BP and Tesco have closed some petrol stations because of petrol and diesel supply issues, brought on by the lack of HGV drivers. There are around , BPO branded filling stations around the country, of which  are operated by BP themselves, and the oil giant has said a handful of these have been forced to close. The oil giant, which is the largest operator of petrol stations in the UK, has not said which specic ones have closed.  The Mirror reached out to BP, but the company could not confirm which specic petrol stations were closed due to the fast-changing situation. BP said in a statement: “We are experiencing some fuel supply issues at some of our retail sites in the UK and unfortunately have therefore seen a handful of sites temporarily close due to a lack of both unleaded and diesel grades. These have been caused by some delays in the supply chain which has been impacted by the industry-wide driver shortages across the UK and there are many actions being taken to address the issue. We continue to work with our haulier supplier to minimise any future disruption and to ensure efficient and effective deliveries to serve our customers.  They are currently working to address the problem, and prioritising deliveries to motorway service areas, major trunk roads and sites with the largest demands. The company said: We continue to work with our haulier supplier to minimise disruption and to ensure efficient and effective deliveries. Esso, which owns  Tesco Alliance sites, has reported similar issues with a small number of them. A spokesperson said: We are working closely with all parties in our distribution network to optimise supplies and minimise any inconvenience to customers. “We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience.” Currently these are the only two suppliers reporting shortages. Supermarket Morrisons has said itaposs not seeing similar issues with any of its  petrol stations, according to the BBC. Similarly, Co-Op, which operates  petrol stations, has a full complement of fuel delivery drivers. Tesco says it has a good availability of fuel, and the BBC report that both Sainsburyaposs and Asda have had no issues in fuel supplies. Why is there a fuel shortage   Is panic-buying understandable - or selfish  Let us know in the comments below Similarly to the food shortage which is causing empty supermarket shelves, the reason for the fuel shortage is to do disruption to the supply chain. This is due to a post-Brexit shortage in the number of HGV drivers. Since the UK left the European Union, many non-UK nationals who drive trucks have opted to work solely within EU countries. This has left logistics firms struggling to find workers. According to The Road Haulage Association , Britain needs as many as , more drivers to keep shops stocked and supplies moving.The coronavirus situation has made everything worse, with the closure of test centres worsening the shortage of drivers.The Department for Transport has recently changed the rules for tests to speed up the process of qualication.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BPExxon Mobil CorporationEuropean Union\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Some UK service stations are rationing fuel as the lorry driver shortage hits petrol supply chains and forces forecourts up and down the country to shut. Worried drivers formed lines before the break of dawn in hopes of filling up, as scenes queuing stretched into a second day. Others were seen carrying jerry cans onto forecourts.At least one bust-up as been witnessed, as a clash broke out at a busy petrol station in Portsmouth, Hants, where drivers had flocked to a Shell station. Two groups of men were aposscreamingapos at each other before one group chased another fleeing in a van - hurling stones at the vehicle, according to a witness. The ugly scenes shocked onlookers at a forecourt in the Hilsea area of the city at around .am. A witness said: People were queuing throughout the night. Pumps are almost dry.Have you been affected by the shortage  Email your stories and pictures to webnews@mirror The man said the groups were screaming and shouting at each other. He added: One group got into their van and drove off out of the city as the other group gave chase and hurled stones at the retreating van. Itaposs utter madness. Lengthy queues were being spotted today around London, Essex and Kent to Bristol and Cambridgeshire, as industry bosses warned the capital and south of England were worst affected. Some petrol stations had road cones blocking forecourt lanes and signs announcing they were closed as pumps ran dry. Police forces are pleading with drivers to be apossensibleapos as lines were seen stretching around roundabouts in some parts of England. EG Group, which runs hundreds of forecourts across Britain, imposed a purchase limit of £ per customer for fuel due to the unprecedented customer demandaposapos.  Petrol retailers say they are unable to transport fuel due to a lack of lorry drivers, which is being blamed on Brexit labour shortages and the pandemic. Some firms have offered handsome cash incentives, salary increases and free training in desperate bids to recruit and retain drivers, as the exodus of EU workers left firms struggling to fill the gap. Reports have speculated the government is likely to bow shortly to industry demand to issue temporary migrant visas to plug the gaps.  Haulage industry bosses have warned the UK is short nearly , lorry drivers. The problem is being exacerbated by a gas price hike crisis threatening the UKaposs food supplies and driving up energy bills to eye-watering rates. Lincolnshire Police warned the queues could cause chaos on the roads and urged drivers not to fill upthey donapost need to. The force said: This is a potential hazard for vehicles making other journeys, and may cause dficulties for emergency services trying to reach people in need. While we appreciate that some people may be particularly keen to fill up their vehicles this weekend, we would respectfully ask motorists to be sensible when making judgements about joining a queue at a petrol station. If it is too long, consider ing at a dferent time. The president of the AA says panic-buying rather than supply chain issues is driving the shortage of fuel at some petrol stations.  Edmund King said the problem should pass in a matter of daysdrivers just stick to filling up when they need it, adding there is plenty of fuel at source. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr King said shortage of lorry drivers had only been a localised problem earlier in the week. We were in discussions with Government ministers last night and we talked to the major fuel companies, and we can reiterate there is not a problem with supply at the source, Mr King said. Earlier in the week, there were some problems with the supply chain, as we know, due to a shortage of some lorry drivers, but that was only a localised problem.  Mr King warned the shortage had been exacerbated by people going out and filling up when they really donapost need to. If you think about it,  million cars out there,theyaposve all got half a tank they all rush out to fill up the rest of the tank and the tank is about  litres, that will put a strain on the system, he said. Mr King said the issues were unlikely to last because the supply chain is not being disrupted by ongoing problems such as industrial action. The good news is you can only really fill up once - youaposve got to use the fuel, so this should be a short-term thing, he said.  Itaposs not like the fuel crises in the past when the supplier was hit by strikes, etc. So, once people have filled up, they wonapost travel more than they normally travel, so this strain on the system should ease up in the next few days. However Mr King said the lorry driver shortage would remain an ongoing issue for the industry until solutions were found. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said: “HGV drivers are the glue which hold our supply chains together. “Without them, we are unable to move goods from farms to warehouses to shops. “Currently, the UK faces a shortfall of around , HGV drivers and it is consumers who ultimately suffer the consequences.” Comment MORE ON Panic-buyingVehiclesBPOn Instagram\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of York is accused of having sex with her on three occasions when she was , knowing she had been trafficked by his close friend, the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Andrew and his accuser, now , jointly agreed that service was effective as of September , according to a Friday filing with the US District Court in Manhattan. The prince has until October  to respond to the lawsuit. He denies Giuffreaposs claims. A previously scheduled October  court hearing has been canceled.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here  The agreement appears for now to end a monthlong effort by Andrewaposs legal team, including lawyers in Britain, to block Giuffreaposs lawsuit at the outset rather than have the -year-old defend against it. Giuffre accused Queen Elizabethaposs second son of forcing her to have sex around two decades ago at the London home of Epsteinaposs longtime associate Ghislaine Maxwell. She also said Andrew abused her at around the same time at Epsteinaposs mansion in Manhattan and on Epsteinaposs private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands.  Andrew has not been charged with crimes. His lawyers are seeking to review a  settlement agreement from a lawsuit against Epstein in Florida, to determine whether it requires a dismissal of Giuffreaposs August  lawsuit. Giuffre is seeking unspecied damages. Epstein, a registered sex offender, also had a home in Florida. He killed himself in a Manhattan jail in August  while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.

The memoir is expected to hit the shelves next year - possibly around the time the Queen is celebrating her historic Diamond Jubilee. Harry said he is writing the book not as the prince I was born, but as the man I have become and stated that it will include the highs and the lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned. Buckingham Palace fear further explosive headlines as they pick up the pieces from Harry and Meghan Markleaposs tell-all Oprah interview. He has been secretly working on a memoir for nearly a year - and it has triggered a tsunami of fear among royal circles.But royal author and publisher Andrew Lownie believes Harry’s personal account could prove to be a step too far for the Firm.He told the Express that the memoir could sour Harryaposs already tricky relationship with his family.He said: “I think given the fact that he’s doing his tell-all book, I would have thought that’s the final straw for them.  The book will be published by Penguin Random House UK, with all proceeds to be donated to charity. Despite profits heading to good causes, two-thirds of Brits says they are aposnot interested at allapos in reading it. Over a third say it is aposinappropriateapos for him to publish it. A YouGov survey found says almost one in  people say he should not have signed the publishing agreement - and most wonapost read it.  In a statement confirming the book, the Duke said: Iaposm writing this not as the prince I was born but as the man I have become. “Iaposve worn many hats over the years, both literally and figuratively, and my hope is that in telling my story - the highs and lows, the mistakes, the lessons learned.

Femicide, the killing of a girl or woman, is a topic that has already been highlighted earlier this year, when Sarah Everard, a -year-old marketing executive, was killed in South London, on her walk back home. These victims tragically add to a horrying statistic that has been recently reported: six women are killed every hour by men around the world, according to UN data. Additionally, a woman is killed by a man every three days in the UK. According to Karen Ingala Smith, co-founder of the Femicide Census, men’s violence against women is a leading cause of the premature death for women globally but research in the UK and Europe is limited and unconnected. Dr Nilufar Ahmed who works as a Behavioural Psychologist at the University of Bristol helped us identy things men can do to help women feel safer and ways to stop violence towards women. How men can help feel women feel safer while walking alone  Being taught consent from a young age Men should learn to accept a womanaposs lack of interest in them. Violence inflicted on women is often entangled with sexual assaults, and therefore should be educated on consent. According to the United Nations Women , freely given and enthusiastic consent should be mandatory, “every time”. UN Women added that phrases like “she was asking for it” or “boys will be boys” attempt to blur the lines around sexual consent, placing blame on victims, and “excusing perpetrators from the crimes they have committed”.  Dr Nilufar Ahmed explained to the Mirror that changing our social attitudes was something that needed to happen across society and from an early age. She said: Understanding consent from an early age. ‘No means no’ is often framed in terms of sexual consent and rape, but it has a much bigger application –someone is rejecting your attention, friendship, or company in any setting, respect this. Schools can play a role in this by teaching young children about respecting boundaries. Being taught gender equality in schools The World Health Organisationpublished a pamphlet revealing that gender inequalities increase the risk of violence by men against women and inhibit the ability of those affected to seek protection. Experts have found that exposing children to non-stereotypical characters found in books and movies, as well as iding housework equally at home, can help children understand the notion that all genders are equal. Stop victim blaming Victim blaming is a way for someone to justy their motivation behind their own crime, while literally blaming their victim for their own action. Too often the behaviour and personalities of the women is scrutinised and judged first before the actions of the man who attacked them. Dr Nilufar Ahmed told The Mirror. She added: As though it is inevitable that a lone woman walking in the dark is automatically at risk of being attacked.  This victim blaming exonerates men from responsibility and blame by focusing on the woman. Allied with this, often when men commit heinous crimes, their crimes are qualied with added information about their lives as ‘good fathers’ or ‘high achieving students’, whilst the women are described only in terms of the way they were dressed and their actions that night. Becoming a better ally to women Doing something as simple as listening to women and their experiences goes a long way. Men should be able to acknowledge their privilege, as well as taking women’s concerns as a serious issue. Furthermore, men should not shy away from calling out blatant sexism and misogynistic behaviour when they witness it. Being supportive and contributing to the safety of women starts by becoming an ally. Destigmatise men’s mental health As the WHO found that potential perpetrators may be at an increased risk of committing femicidethey are unemployed, own a firearm, have made previous threats to kill with a weapon, or have committed sexual violence, men’s mental health needs to be addressed. Saying things like “man up” or “boys don’t cry” nourishes a culture of toxic masculinity which both prevents men from expressing their feelings, but also lead to dangerous behaviour such as resulting in violence instead of communication. According to Dr Nilufar Ahmed, there is not one reason that pushes men to harm and kill women, but it can include psychological reasons such as feeling rejected, feeling incapable of attracting a partner, being angry, feeling emasculated, a need to assert control, feeling entitled. These do not necessarily have to be about women – a man may experience repeated rejection from jobs, be angry at their landlord, etc, She said. She continued: Unaddressed, this can boil over and be projected onto a target that men are stronger than – women. Most men experiencing these will not go on to harm women butthese feelings are overwhelming go unresolved they can be damaging to the inidual and others around them, and could in extreme circumstances lead to aggression and even murder. If men are struggling with any of these issues accessing mental health support can help to work through them. Facilitate women’s access to protection and safety against domestic violence The WHO has revealed that there is an increased risk of perpetuating femicidethe aggressor has a history of intimate partner or family violence. A men with a history of domestic violence thereby is more likely to murder his partner. Domestic violence is reportedly not taken seriously in UK courts, as criminologist Jane Monkton-Smith toldthat her examination of  domestic abuse killings shows how sentences for manslaughter convictions were often mitigated by “ridiculous claims, like how much the perpetrator said they loved the victim”. Immediate things men can do to help according to a psychologist Dr Nilufar Ahmed said: Immediate things men can do are to be mindful to keep a safe distance from women when out walking or running. If you see a situation where a woman looks uncomfortable don’t be afraid to intervene either yourself or by making someone  aware .As a society we must all take responsibility for collective behaviours and actions. This means calling out comments and behaviour that are disrespectful to women whenever we encounter them.

A -second clip shows a balding man wearing a black hooded coat and grey jeans looking over his shoulder and pulling at his hood as he walks down a path. The Met spokesperson told the Mirror earlier today the force was not speculating about the appearance of the manaposs hands or reports of how Sabina may have been killed. Earlier today reports claim police sources believe she was pounced upon and attacked with a hammer just moments after leaving her flat on what should have been a five-minute walk across a park to her pub date.  Detectives have also released an image, captured in the Pegler Square area of Kidbrooke, of a silver car they believe the man has access to. The Met has appealed for anyone who recognised either to contact the force immediately. Detective chief inspector Neil John, from the Metaposs Specialist Crime Command, said an extensive trawl of CCTV in the area continued and said information on the manaposs identity and whereabouts could be vital to the investigation. Sabina was walking to meet a date at The Depot bar in Pegler Square near her home at around .pm last Friday when she was attacked.  A member of the public found her body under a pile of leaves close to the OneSpace community centre in Cator Park, in the borough of Greenwich, on Saturday at around .pm. The politan Police said a -year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of Sabinaaposs murder. The suspect was arrested at an address in Lewisham on Thursday and is being questioned in custody. It is the second arrest Scotland Yard has made in connection with the attack. On Saturday, detectives arrested a man in his s on suspicion of murder before he was released under further investigation.  Ms Nessaaposs cousin Zubel Ahmed remembered her as a beautul soul who loved teaching, telling the BBC that she was the most caring person - kindest, sweetest girl you could meet. Lisa Williams, the head of Rushey Green Primary School where Ms Nessa taught, said staff and pupils are taking our time to reflect and process the devastating news of her death and will be remembering the teacher privately. In a statement, Mrs Williams said: We have shared the details about the vigil with our school community and some people may be attending on a personal level to privately pay their respects.  As a school we are taking our time to reflect and process the devastating news we received this week, and will be commemorating Sabina in our own way. The vigil is being held on Friday evening at pm at Pegler Square, and people who cannot attend are being encouraged to hold a candle at their doorstep at the same time. Reclaim These Streets, a campaign group involved in supporting the Kidbrooke communityaposs vigil for Sabina, said it is angry and heartbroken about her murder. Tower Hamlets Councillor Rabina Khan told BBC Radio aposs Today programme said she was attending the vigil this evening and hoped high profile people would also attend. I too, just like my daughters, I have a -year-old, I have a -year-old, we spoke up for Sarah Everard, she said. When we saw high profile people who attended , I was really pleased and proud that the Duchess of Cambridge attended the vigil... I hope, tonight, we see many profiled people attending Sabina Nessaaposs vigil.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Scotland Yardpolitan PoliceCCTVMurderCCTV footageSabina Nessa\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Met is appealing for help in finding a balding man shown on CCTV walking through Pegler Square in Kidbrooke, south-east London - the area where the primary school teacher was heading on the evening she died. The force released the video on Friday and said the man is believed to have been carrying a reflective red object. DCI Neil John, from the Met’s Specialist Crime Command, said the man, pictured wearing a black hooded jacket and grey jeans, may have been trying to hide the object up his sleeve.  He said: “I continue to appeal for any witnesses and anyone with information to contact police and share what they know. “People in the Kidbrooke area last Friday may recall seeing this man carrying a red reflective object, and possibly trying to conceal it up his sleeve. If so, please call police. “Please share the CCTV footage on social media and, especiallyyou have connections to London or Kent, show the image to family members and friends who may not have seen it. He must be traced. “We all saw at yesterday evening’s vigil the impact that Sabina’s death has had on the community. “I would reiterate my plea to those in the local area to think andyou have any information that could help this investigation, then please get in touch.”  Hundreds of mourners, including tearful relatives, gathered for an emotional candlelit vigil in memory of Ms Nessa on Friday. Jebina Yasmin Islam, her sister, broke down as she addressed crowds at the vigil. She said: “I just want to say thank you to everyone who came today to show support for my sister. “We have lost an amazing, caring, beautul sister, who left this world far too early.” She added: “Sabina loved her family.  “Words cannot describe how we are feeling, this feels like we are stuck in a bad dream and can’t get out of it – our world is shattered, we are simply lost for words. “No family should go through what we are going through.” Ms Nessa’s uncle Shahin Miah described his niece as “a kind and a open-minded person”, who was “always smiling and helping others”. He said Ms Nessa’s death has “once again brought to the fore the question of women’s safety on the streets”. In his statement, he said: “We don’t want what happened to Sabina to happen to anyone .  “We don’t want any other mother’s chest to be empty or filled with deep sorrow, or to see the tears in the eyes of any father.”The Duchess of Cambridge also described how she was “saddened by the loss of another innocent young woman on our streets” on Twitter.OneSpace community centre, which is close to where a dog walker discovered Ms Nessa’s body a week ago, invited members of the community to write tributes to her in a book of condolence as it re-opened on Saturday. The building had been cordoned off by police as they searched the surrounding Cator Park where officers believe Ms Nessa was attacked, and it remained closed until the weekend as a “mark of respect”, the owners said. Ms Nessa had been walking to meet a friend at a pub near her home when she was attacked in Cator Park on September . Her body was discovered by a member of the public the next day, having been hidden under a pile of leaves, it was reported. Two men were separately arrested on suspicion of her murder but were subsequently released under investigation. Detectives also circulated an image, captured in the same area, of a silver car they believe the man they are searching for had access to and appealed for anyone who recognised either to contact the force immediately. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information at www.mirror email .

Ms Nessa, , was taking a five-minute walk to meet a friend at The Depot bar in Pegler Square near her home in Kidbrooke, south-east London, on September  at around .pm when she was attacked. A member of the public found her body close to the OneSpace community centre in Cator Park on Saturday at around .pm. A -year-old man arrested in connection with the murder has been released under investigation, the politan Police said today.  The man was arrested on Thursday at an address in Lewisham, south-east London, and detectives are continuing to appeal for information about another man captured on CCTV in Pegler Square on the evening Ms Nessa was attacked. In a statement released to the PA news agency ahead of a rally at the East London Mosque, her sister Jebina Yasmin Islam said: We as a family are shocked of the murder of our sister, daughter and aunty to my girls. There are no words to describe how we are feeling as a family at the moment. We did not expect that something likewould ever happen to us. I urge everyone to walk on busy streets when walking home from work, school or a friendaposs homes. Please keep safe.  I ask you to pray for our sister and make duafor her. May Allahgrant her paradise. Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust race equality think tank, told PA: Speaking as a woman and a Londoner from the cityaposs Bangladeshi community, Iaposm heartbroken. Sabina is related to members of my extended family and everything I know about her speaks of a beautul, intelligent young woman who had so much le to live, and so, so much to offer in terms of making a positive dference to the peopleaposs lives she touched, not least her familyaposs and the young children she taught at school. Tragically, gender-based violence does not occur in isolation. I do not know how many more women will suffer before our streets are safe. What I do know is that Sabinaaposs death fills all of us with grief. Londoners, regardless of their gender, are hopeful that Sabinaaposs murderer will be found and brought to justice swtly.  Community leaders and Asian women, some of whom said they were too wary to attend a vigil for Ms Nessa on Friday night in south-east London but still wanted to show their solidarity in a location they feel safe, are among those who are gathering at the mosque. Fridayaposs events in memory of Ms Nessa come a week after she died and as the public spotlight is thrown on womenaposs safety and gender-based violence. Her death comes after the public outrage and protests over the abduction and murder of -year-old marketing executive Sarah Everard as she walked home alone in south London in March. Sufia Alam, of the East London Mosque and the Maryam Centre, said: This brutal murder of one of our shining stars is genuinely saddening and deeply shocking. I have three daughters, and I canapost even begin to express what I am feeling right now. Sarah Everard was one of our daughters, and so was Sabina Nessa - their lives were tragically cut short - at the hands of violence and brutality. We have much work to do against the violence faced by women in our society. We will not stop campaigning until our mothers, sisters and daughters are safe anywhere and everywhere. She said this state of affairs is not just about women and girls being vulnerable, this is about men and boys and educating them early on about respecting and honouring women and girls, and treating them with the dignity they deserve. Ms Alam, who is set to be at the east London rally where many women are due to attend, added: When a Muslim woman is murdered, this dampens the aspirations of other Muslim women and girls in education and employment - and this will be particularly hard for us to deal with and manage.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON House of CommonsMurderCrimePoliticsHate crimeSabina Nessa\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Scotland Yard is appealing for help as detectives work around the clock to solve the -year-oldaposs murder in south London. Sabinaaposs death has led to widespread grief and amplied concerns about womenaposs safety after she was killed as she was about to set out on what should have been a five-minute walk. Sabina had left her Kidbrooke home to make the short journey across a park to a pub to meet a date at around .pm Friday when she vanished. A dog walker discovered her body under a pile of leaves at a park the following day. Sabina was described as “beautul, talented and caring” by her grieving sister. Pals said the talented young woman had dreams of moving abroad to teach in Dubai.  Where did she vanish  Detectives say Sabina, a teacher at the Rushey Green Primary School in Lewisham, set out on what would have been a five-minute journey to meet a friend at a pub in Kidbrooke Village, south London, at around .pm Friday. Her short journey would have taken her about  minutes from her Astell Rd home across Cator Park to get to The Depot in Pegler Square. Pals have said she was excited about going on a date with an old friend that evening at the bar. But she never arrived. Sabina was not reported missing by anyone after failing to show up to the bar. Adog walker found her body near a walkway close to the OneSpace community centre in Cator Park, Kidbrooke, in the Royal Borough of Greenwich at around .pm Saturday, under a pile of leaves. Police have not yet said publicly at what point of the journey she is believed to have been attacked.  What was the cause of death  A post-mortem carried out at Greenwich Mortuary proved to be inconclusive, police said on Monday. Detectives have said they believe she was hit with a heavy object and was taken to Cator Park, where her body was found. A Met Police spokesman said the force is not commenting on the reporting on the suspected murder weapon.Who killed her Police have said they were keeping an open mind on a motive to the killing, which has been widely reported as a suspected stranger attack Speaking at the scene where tributes had been laid to Sabina next to the police cordon at Cator Park on Thursday, Detective Chief Superintendent Trevor Lawry said earlier he is “keeping a completely open mind” on what the motive of the attacker may have been.  Asked whether detectives were worried the killer could attack someone , he said: “We have lines of inquiry that we’re pursuing at the moment. “It’s always a concern that it may happen, but that’s not something that we have any intelligence on at this time.” Asked whether he believed the killing was a stranger attack, DCI Lawry told reporters:“That’s definitely a line of inquiry that we’re looking at.” Sabinaaposs flatmate, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reporters she feels unsafe after losing her friend. Her fearful housemate of four months said she had last seen Sabina when the pair hung out and took pictures together.She told: ‘I never thought something like this could happen to her. I had been texting her and it’s not like her to not reply to my messages.“I don’t feel safe living here now.”  Who is the man in the CCTV images  Police say CCTV images of a man seen walking through south London is another person they would like to speak to. The force says the unknown man was in the area at the time of the attack, as well as pictures of a silver car they believe he has access to. The images of the man, taken from CCTV, shows him walking in Pegler Square, south London, on the evening Sabina was attacked. Where is the mystery car captured on CCTV going  Police have also released an image of the car they believe the man has access to, which was also captured in the Pegler Square area. Police are urging anyone who recognises the man and vehicle to make contact immediately. They have not revealed any more detail yet about exactly where or when the car was seen or what direction it was heading. However they have said they are appealing for sightings of the man and car across the south London borough of Greenwich, including in Catford, Kidbrooke and Greenwich itself. Have arrests been made  A man in his s was arrested on suspicion of murder at an address in Lewisham on Saturday evening, and was later released under police investigation. The politan Police announced on Thursday that a second, -year-old man had been arrested at an address in Lewisham on suspicion of Sabinaaposs murder and was being held in custody.  What you can you to help Police want to speak to anyone who may have seen anything that could help their investigation. Anyone who recognises the man in the CCTV images or has seen him in recent days is being urged to contact the Met. Detective Chief Inspector Neil John, from the Metaposs Specialist Crime Command, said: Our team have been working tirelessly to find the person responsible for Sabinaaposs murder and this has included an extensive trawl of CCTV, work which remains ongoing. We would ask anyone - especially those in Kidbrooke and the wider area of Lewisham and Greenwich - to take a careful look at these images to check whether you know who this man is or have seen him over recent days. Any information as to his identity or whereabouts could be vital for our investigation so we are asking you to share this image far and wide to ensure as many people as possible see it.  Where to attend the vigil for Sabina Nessa Vigils are being held for Sabina in locations around London later on Friday, and people are being encouraged to light candles on their doorsteps. Reclaim the Streets, a campaign group calling for an end to male violence against women, involved in organising previous vigils, said it is “angry and heartbroken” about her murder. Sabinaaposs death comes after the killings of Sarah Everard, who was knidnapped and murdered by a Met cop as she walked home, and sisters Bibaa Henry, Nicole Smallman, who were stabbed to death in a park. ‘I don’t feel safe living here now.’ Sabinaaposs community of Kidbrooke in Greenwich have organised a vigil at pm on Friday evening in Pegler Square, with the support of Reclaim these Streets. The vigil will be held to remember Sabina, how she lived and the lives she transformed as campaigners demand womenaposs rights to safety, the campaign group says.

So many of us have done some research into how we can get rid of them and, for instance, bought plants that help keep them away as a result.While they are actually a type of crane fly according to the Wildle Trust, daddy long legs are often incorrectly believed to be spiders because of their long legs.And an expert has now explained why we shouldnapost kill daddy long legs even though so many people are scared by them. Although slightly annoying, this type of crane fly is completely harmless and doesnapost bite like some spiders, as reported by CoventryLive.Karl Curtis, director of reserves and community engagement at Warwickshire Wildle Trust, said: They are out this time of year because basically, they are hatching out of our lawns and ious places - they live a lot of their lives underground as a grub, as a larva, and then what they do is they hatch out over the summer. Probably now is the last throw of the dice, and what they do is they come out and looking to mate, lay eggs back into vegetation and then they die off.  He added: They often get confused with spiders but theyaposre not, theyaposre flies, theyaposre really good food source for birds, theyaposre really important to play their part so people should let them out their windows and not kill them. Mr Curtis also said that things like fly sprays are bad for the environment and other living things so should be avoided. And he noted that crane flies are in fact not poisonous, contrary to popular belief and shouldnapost be feared. What do you think about this story  Sign in and let us know in the comments below  He argued they have probably got a reputation for being poisonous as people mistakenly think they are cellar spiders. The very long spindly spiders that you get in the corners of your room, theyaposre called cellar spiders, those do pack a punch, but they are not dangerous to humans, he said. [Crane flies] theyaposre absolutely harmless. While the female has a point on the end of her abdomen, thataposs to lay eggs, itaposs not a stinger.Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirrorHe went on: The reason they come into the house is for warmth and they are attracted to light sothe lights are on in the house they come inside, and they hatch out in the darker hours to avoid being eaten by birds. Theyaposre not looking for shelter, theyaposre out looking for a mate and then looking to lay eggs, they end up in houses because their favourite habitat is short grass and we have lawns.

Dan headed to the National Driving Centre in Croydon, South London, where trainees can drive trucks of up to  tons and . metres. And our man admitted: “It was terrying. We’re only driving around a quiet car park, but the stress of being in control of such a massive vehicle with other cars, people and buildings around is enough to make me glad we’re not out on the road. “When I set off going backwards in the NCA’s articulated lorry, I’m a shambles, struggling to keep the lorry straight.  “Even crawling is an overwhelming exercise in concentration. “I managed to inch the lorry into the bay but I’m horried to see how close I am to the barrier. I think it’s saferI stick to my day job.” Dan’s experience came as firms are trying to fill , vacancies. The Government today sets out a visa scheme allowing , foreign truckers to work in the UK temporarily. And the Department of Transport has simplied HGV testing in a bid to fast-track , lorry-driving rookies into jobs before Christmas. For example, reversing exercises have been cut from the main test as a time-saver. Kate Gibbs, of the Road Haulage Association, said: “Safety has to be paramount. It’s inevitable accidents will happen and we have to do all we can to make sure that that doesn’t happen.”  Victoria Lebrec lost her left leg when she was knocked off her bicycle by an HGV in . Now head of policy at the RoadPeace campaign group, Victoria, , warned: “More people will be killed and seriously injuredroad safety is compromised. “This feels like something that has been rushed through in reaction to an economic issue and I’m worried it has not been properly considered.” Laurence Bolton, of the National Driving Centre, said it was “a huge ask” to expect ordinary drivers to master lorry driving without proper experience.

It’s important to note that everyone copes with grief in dferent ways, and there is no real right or wrong in the grieving process.With digital reminders of your loved one on social media s like Facebook and Instagram, things can get really tough. Although there are ways to turn off the profiles, you may still miss their online presence and knowing that they are a short message away for a quick chat.Reopening old text messages are bound to bring up many emotions, but what about those who continue to text their loved one  It’s now a common coping mechanism, and experts say it can actually be useful for those to deal with the transition. When considering why many people do this to cope with their loss, psychologist Ingrid Collins said: “When a loved one dies, we find it hard to adjust immediately to the fact that they are no longer physically with us. “In the first stages of grief, we tend to become emotionally numb as a result of the trauma of bereavement, often finding it dficult to accept that they are really gone.”FRisk is a wakeup call for the millions of people with no will or protection in place for their own death.

Ingrid continued: “Be it imaginary, as some believe, or communicating with the lingering soul of the loved one, as others believe. “Either way, it is a way of softening the harsh reality of never being in their physical presence again.  As a culture, it’s no doubt that we are taught to cope well with bereavement, with a “stf upper lip” approach for many. To some, that may signy that the inidual may not be coping well at all, and bottling up any emotions from others. When talking about text messaging loved ones that have passed away, Ingrid said: “Any method that enables us to prolong the comfort of the relationship with the deceased or,the bond was challenging, to go some way to resolving the relationship, is to be welcomed. “Sometimes people cling on to their loved one’s physical possessions that serve as a reminder. “This is one way of adjusting. Some take up a campaign in order to bring some meaning to what might otherwise appear to be a random or supposedly preventable death.” In short, those who choose to communicate with a deceased person are “taking an effective shortcut to arriving at some measure of acceptance.” Comment MORE ON GrievingText messagesFrisk\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Bradley Lynn, , and Connor Williams, , have been filmed carrying stacks of waste to leave at deserted roadsides. Environment chiefs launched an investigation to find the fly-tippers after they used fake number plates to carry out the crimes. CCTV footage shows Lynn and Williams apparently travelling in an untaxed and unregistered tipper van. The pair were spotted dumping rubbish at a former LG site in Newport, South Wales, in September and October last year. The site has been dubbed the Road to Nowhere as it has become a hotspot for fly-tipping.  Lynn, of Splott, Cardf, and Williams, of Trowbridge, pleaded guilty to an offence under the Environmental Protection Act . Magistrates in Newport fined each man £ and ordered them to pay costs of £, and a victimaposs surcharge of £. Newport city council said it worked with Gwent Police and Fly Tipping Action Wales to bring them to court.  After the case, Councillor Roger Jeavons said: I would like to thank the public for providing information that led to the identication of these two people. As well as fines, they could have faced being sent to prison for this crime and I hope this prosecution will act as a deterrent to others who illicitly dump waste. Residents should also note thatthey employ others to clear waste and itaposs not disposed of legally then they would also be liable and could be prosecuted.  We will not hesitate to take action against those who deliberately dump refuse on our land. It is a crime that blights our communities, the city and our environment and it will not be tolerated.

The September mini-heatwave is due to give way to something much colder and ­wetter, with hail and thunder even predicted in some parts of the UK on Monday. Most of us have enjoyed glorious sunrises recently, like the one in Baldersdale, Co Durham , yesterday. But don’t get used to them.BBC weather forecaster Matt Taylor said: “If you’re wondering where autumn is, it’s not far away. Wait until we get to mid-week, next week – a big change. Temperatures are going to drop.” They could fall as low as C in Inverness, which is enjoying temperatures in the high teens this weekend. And while London will bask in C today, it will be wet tomorrow and thermometers will only reach about C.Nicola Maxey, at the Met Office, said a cold front will cross the UK from East to West on Monday bringing ­“potentially heavy rain”.She added: “Hail and thunder is also a risk to the North and West, so Monday heralds a real change to autumnal-style weather.” Met Meteorologist Adam Thornhill said the change is due to “a sht in the position of the jet stream”. ■ An ash cloud from the La Palma volcano has grounded flights to and from the Spanish island.

Sunday will be slightly cloudier but the temperature will otherwise remain around C in most places. The western parts of England and the whole of Wales could see some cloud and potential rain on Saturday morning before it brightens up in the afternoon with highs of C.  This could take a turn on Sunday with some heavy showers in the South East. North-western Scotland meanwhile will be windy in the morning on Saturday before becoming a mainly dry day with some bright or sunny spells developing and highs of C. Sunday will be largely dry and bright with strong southerly winds around the coast. The weather will take a turn on Monday, with the Met Office predicting next week to be the start of autumnal weather.It comes as people have been warned by the AA to not top up their cars outside of their normal routines ahead of planning any potential weekend trips away to take advantage of the weather. Nicky Maxey, for the Met Office, said: Youaposre much more likely to see highs of  degrees more widely but we could see some spots reaching highs of  or C.  It will be similar on Sunday, with places such as Lincolnshire potentially seeing similar temperatures, but still the higher temperatures being in isolated pockets rather than widespread. She added: Sunday perhaps will see an increased chance of rain, but thereaposs still plenty of sunny spells around and fine weather. But we have got a cold front moving in to Northern Ireland and Scotland on Sunday and then crossing from east to west of the UK on Monday. Thataposs bringing some potentially heavy rain. Thereaposs still some sunshine scattered round on Monday but we could see heavier showers. Hail and thunder is also a risk to the North and West, so Monday heralds a real change towards the autumnal-style weather. Weather forecast for Saturday: Starting rather cloudy with occasional drizzle or rain in the west, especially northwestern Scotland where it will also become increasingly windy. Some sunny intervals likely where. Very warm in sunshine. Outlook for Sunday to Tuesday: Still warm for many on Sunday, some heavy showers in the South East. Rain and stronger winds arriving into the west starting a change to cooler, unsettled conditions early next week.

Holly McGuire, , was put into an induced coma and given just a % chance of survival after contracting the virus. She needed a tube inserted into her windpipe to help her breath and spent six weeks in hospital fighting for her le. Now she is urging everyone of all ages to get the jab, saying: “It could save your le. Never take le for granted. This can happen to anyone – including you. “I was an anti-vaxxer, I was ­unvaccinated. Now I can honestly tell people Covid is real.  “Please, everyone, ignore the nonsense some people are spouting, get the jab. “Luckily for me I have lived to tell my story. But I nearly died twice. “My husband Steve was told to prepare for the worst. He phoned my mum in tears saying it didn’t look like I would make it.” Holly, who appeared in the TV series Footballers Wives in , said she battled double pneumonia and her lung collapsed while she was in hospital.She spent two weeks in a coma, missing her daughter Madison’s ­seventh birthday, and due to breathing ­dficulties caused by the coronavirus she also had a tracheotomy. What do you think of this story  Join the debate in our comments  Holly, from Grays, Essex, but now living in Marbella, Spain, said: “I have a healthy diet, don’t party, hardly drink and don’t smoke. I thought, ‘This disease won’t affect me’. “A lot of my friends were anti-vaxxers, campaigning against the jab, and I was listening to them, too. “People were saying we won’t know for yearsthe jab is reliable and seeing news reports from back home I didn’t feel reassured by the UK Government. “I thought there were so many reasons not to have it. “I now regret that so much. I made so many excuses not to have it, but when I caught Covid it was dreadful, it hit me like a truck. Just get vaccinated as soon as possible.” Holly tested ­positive for Covid on July  and spent  days isolating at home. But she started having breathing dficulties and was admitted to intensive care in a Spanish hospital. She developed pneumonia in both lungs. Doctors struggled to bring her out of the coma fearing she could lose her le. When Holly did wake up she had lost two and a half stone and was struggling to use her legs, needing intense physio to help her walk again. She said: “I was in hospital for six weeks in total and I am so grateful to still be here. “I’ve felt shattered ever since.

But it was the reason why one particular child couldn’t focus that changed everything for deputy head-teacher Rebekah Wilson.“A boy in my class didn’t seem his normal happy self and he couldn’t concentrate for scratching his stomach,” says -year-old Rebekah, known as Bex. “He told me he didn’t have a bed at home, and the cushion he shared with his brother to sleep on was infested with bed bugs.”This was the moment that Bex, who works at an inner city primary school in Leeds, realised the impact that hygiene could have on her pupils and their education. “Times are hard for some families who are having to choose what they can do without,” she says. “Hygiene items often get sacriced. We’re not talking luxuries here, just the absolute basics like toilet roll, shampoo, deodorant, shower gel and soap. “Going without these things affects kids’ self-esteem. Imagine what it’s likeyou can’t keep yourself clean or you don’t have clean clothes  It can really stop children learning, engaging and taking part at school and it can lead to bullying or them being singled out.” Happily there’s an organisation that’s helping to relieve the pressure. The Hygiene Bank, which stresses that being clean is a basic human right, collects new, unused, in-date personal care and household cleaning essentials and distributes them to families in need through schools like Bex’s and charities.  And Boots has been supporting The Hygiene Bank by hosting more than  banks in stores across the UK where customers can donate their own hygiene products. The retailer then donates four products for every kilogram that has been donated. Toothbrushes and toothpaste are two items Bex knows are particularly needed. “So many children are coming to school with tooth problems now,” she says. “Bad dental health can cause a lot of pain and distress and really affect children’s confidence.” But something as simple as shampoo or shower gel can also improve the wellbeing and happiness of those struggling to stay afloat. “I had a mum in tears the other day because we’d given her a hygiene package that included some shower gel. As little as a p bottle can make a dference. She said it felt like Christmas.” Another mum had just £ left for her weekly shopping. “She needed nappies, washing powder and washing up liquid. She didn’t know what to buy because she knew she couldn’t get it all.” Hygiene products provided through The Hygiene Bank across the UK help fill the gap. “We all deserve a certain minimum,” says Bex. “We need to ensure every family has access to these basics, and remove the stigma of asking for support, making sure that families are treated with respect.” Boots leads big donation drive Boots and charity The Hygiene Bank are working together to provide much-needed hygiene and personal care products to people living in poverty.  In the last year, Boots, which has more than  donation points in stores across the UK, has given more than , items – from toothpaste to shower gel, soap to shampoo – to hundreds of communities and charities across the UK. Boots donates hygiene products to The Hygiene Bank. And since it believes every child has the right to feel good when they go back to school, Boots has also worked with the charity to design educational resources for parents and teachers to help young people understand hygiene and hygiene poverty. In its ‘You donate  we donate’ initiative, Boots gives four products for every kilogram of items donated to The Hygiene Bank in Boots stores.You can donate at your local Boots donation point, through the boots e-voucher scheme, and directly to The Hygiene Bank. Products are distributed to those who need them via schools, charities, council services and voluntary organisations.

It all got a bit heated.I was prepared to be called a hypocrite, a fascist and to be asked why I don’t go to China to be shot at . I’ve been managing quite well during the last few weeks to stay calm during the barrage of questions that have been coming my way. People have been quite rightly furious and upset by what we are doing and I accept that. What frustrated me on Wednesday was the refusal by the other people on the programme to accept the physical reality we are in. The reality that Sir David King means when he says, “What we do in the next three to four years will determine the future of humanity”. That’s the reason I’m on the telly sitting through that rage and anger. It is because I really care about the country I live in and all the people who live here. Do you agree with Insulate Britainaposs actions  Have your say in the comments below  What the GMB presenters are not ready to accept is that climate breakdown isn’t primarily about survival of polar bears and dolphins, as important as they are, but about the survival of our economy, our NHS and of the very fabric of our society. This means many people will suffer.  What Insulate Britainis asking for is to conserve our society. To do that at this time means having to make some tough decisions, we understand that. The comparisons to Churchill on the programme upset Richard Madeley. I wasn’t saying that IB were the same as Churchill, what I was saying was that there were some similarities. The people that didn’t want to oppose Hitler were seen as appeasing Hitler. Churchill understood that you either faced up to the reality now or you paid for it later. He had the support of just six MPs. That meant that  million people lost their lives. It was locked in. There is a similarity now. If we don’t move as rapidly as Sir David King says we should, the suffering of millions of people in the next few decades will be locked in, unstoppable. What was happening on GMB on Wednesday was appeasement. A refusal to accept the reality, while also turning their anger of that reality onto me. Well we feel angry too. Angry that our government has ignored our letters, petitions and protests for  years.Insulating our homes is our line in the sand and we will not let them cross it. It gives the best value for money in terms of CO emissions, will provide hundreds of thousands of meaningful jobs and will stop tens of thousands of our elderly from freezing to death each winter and means families can heat and eat. This isnapost aboutmy home is insulated or not. Itaposs not about whether Iaposm a hypocrite for calling for all homes to be insulated. Itaposs about how tackling the climate crisis will not only save our country from destruction, but also benefit millions of our citizens and bring them out of fuel poverty. Itaposs a win-win. What Richard and Susanna don’t seem to understand is thatthe government continues to ignore us, it will get much more heated.

Talisker Cornford, founder of group Urban Angels, described how she has been grabbed and followed at all times of day while alone in London.“Sometimes itaposs subtle, she told My London. And sometimes itaposs very explicit.“Iaposve had people try and stop and talk to me a lot or try grabbing my arm and talking to me. Just being very persistent. Day and night. People shouting things at you, following you, I feel like thereaposs too many examples.” The -year-old, who set up the initiative in March in the wake of the Sarah Everard case, has seen it quickly grow to a worldwide community. She started it with a friend while studying in Exeter and similar groups were quickly launched in Birmingham, Cardf, Portsmouth and Brighton.Have you been affected by this story  Let us know at webnews@mirror  Talisker is in the process of setting up groups across London and next week one goes live in Amsterdam. Plans are also in the works for a Toronto version of Urban Angels. The group is used for alerts, discussions about safety measures, and many cities now have walking schemes to pair up people walking in the same direction late at night. She was speaking in light of the murder of Sabina Nessa, who was found dead in Kidbrooke, south-east London, on Saturday morning.The -year-old school teacher had been walking a short distance to the pub from her home the night before when she was attacked. It comes as Transport for London said it has no plans for theof the Night Tube until next year after the Covid pandemic saw the service halted. The   train service operated on Fridays and Saturdays for the Victoria, Jubilee and most of the Piccadilly, Central and Northern lines.It means night buses, taxis or walking are often the only means of transport home after dark. “Itaposs not a good move. In terms of womenaposs safety and safety for non-binary people,” said Talisker of the decision to hold off on reintroducing the service.  “I really want the Night Tube back. Andy Lord, managing director of the London Underground, said: “We are playing, and will continue to play, our full role in London’s recovery from the pandemic. We are running as close to a full service as possible across all our services and the Tube continues to serve Central London with last trains leaving around : and starting again at :. Our extensive night bus network continues to operate. We are continuing to review our options for when we might be able to reintroduce the full Friday and Saturday Night Tube in a safe and viable way and are exploring the feasibility of reintroducing some services on one or two lines more quickly.” Talisker believes people might feel safer using the Night Tube rather than the night buses which still operate across London but can be a minefield. “One of the big things for safety that a lot of people always say is familiarity, she said. If you donapost know where you are, you’re instantly less safe, because you kind of donapost understand which routes you are taking, youaposre potentially going to be out for longer or later.” The campaigner went on to say Tubes are in areas more densely populated and often staffed.

Emma Cousins, , from Sheffield, has been living with one eye after being diagnosed with mesenchymal chondrosarcoma in April . She had noticed her left eye appearing to grow and bulge and shortly after her daughteraposs second birthday she went to AE to get checked out as she started to feel unwell. Emma, who is mum to an -year-old son and five-year-old daughter, said: “My eye felt stretched and I felt sick. “The doctor thought it was a small bleed so I saw an out of hours optician who askedI had any selfies on my phone.  “I had six years’ worth of pictures so I showed the optician, who asked to see pictures of me from further back. “It was at that point I thought ‘oh no something is wrong’. I managed to find pictures of me at . “The optician said he didn’t know for sure but that it looked like something had been growing behind my eye since I was .” Looking at the images side-by-side, Emma could see a subtle dference as her eye appeared to grow and bulge over time. She was booked in for an MRI scan which found a large tumour growing behind her eye and in April  a biopsy was taken to seeit could be salvaged.  Sadly, nothing could be done and she was diagnosed with a form of sarcoma cancer – and told she would lose her eye. Emma said: “I thought ‘no, it can’t be, I’m too young’ and the doctor was acting very nervous. “The doctor said ‘the eye will have to come out’ and told me I’m the only person in England with it, and that chemotherapy wouldn’t work.“He told me not to Google it but obviously that was the first thing I did when I was alone.“I wish I had listened as all I could find were pages saying it spreads to the lungs and you die. “After reading that it made me panic and the reality kicked in – I was going to lose my eye and I had cancer.” Over the following weeks, surgeons planned the tricky, warning Emma that, while they would remove as much of the tumour as possible, she would be left disfigured. Emma said: “I had to tell my children because, with my eye going, I couldn’t hide it from them. “I told them I needed to have my eye removed then I would be better.” In June , she had her eyeball removed in a terrying procedure. Emma said: “I was nervous but knowing I had cancer and how bad it could be made me feel better about it. “Losing an eye for a chance of saving my le was a risk I was willing to take. “I think one of the worst things was  minutes before the eye removal, one of the nurses drew an arrow on my forehead to highlight which eye it was – and for the rest of my time left with two eyes I was panicking they would take the wrong eye out by mistake. “My main concern was what would happen with the kids – my daughter was so young at the time, so she wouldn’t remember anything about me.” Thankfully, Emma made it through the tough surgery and started a six-week course of radiation therapy, which caused burns to her skin. Sadly, she had a reaction to the treatment and ended up in ICU connected to a ventilator as she fought off the debilitating symptoms linked to fulminant multiple sclerosis, which left her “completely paralysed”. She said: “I couldn’t even talk – it was like being completely locked in my own body, unable to communicate anything. “Doctors told my family I would die, but to their surprise I regained the ability to talk, my arms started to work, and I have slowly recovered to the point I can now walk myself – although not as well as I used to.”  Her medics were left equally baffled by the adverse reaction and much is still unclear about why Emma suffered so much post-surgery. As soon as she saw herself with one eye, Emma realised she looked “dferent to anybody ”. She said: “The first thing I can remember thinking was ‘wow it doesn’t look as bad as I thought’. “It was still a few months before it all settled and the bruising had gone down, but it looked so much nicer than I had presumed it would look. “I actually liked it because everything has been done now with hair and makeup, whereas everyone notices how dferent I look – and I try to live up to that with my eye patches. “After all, they are going to stare at me anyway, so why not give them something to stare at ” Later that month in June , Emma was referred to have a prosthetic eye made, but found it to look “fake” and be too much “faff”, so opted instead to wear glasses and eye patches. Over time, a small hole developed in her empty socket – which doctors believe was caused by the radiation – that has been widened. Emma said: “Because the radiation has killed veins in my socket they supply the skin with blood and because blood cannot get to the area the skin dies and that’s what the hole is. “I’ve waited over a year for the operation but now the hole is getting bigger simple things like having a shower or being in heavy rain can drown me. “As the hole is directly connected to my lungs – meaning anything going in my eye can enter my lungs. “I have to stay away from a swimming pool and baths as I could drown.” Her children have been incredibly supportive, as Emma explained: “They have been wonderful. When the hole first appeared to now, they have had to see it grow in size but have been great at adapting – even though it has meant no swimming, which they love. “I don’t think they realise just how good they have been throughout all of this. “They have had to grow up so fast and seen daily not only how big the hole is getting, but my daily struggle to recover.” Despite her suffering, she has received global attention on TikTok, after taking to the social media  to share videos of her empty socket. One video received  million views, with thousands of fans cheering her on. One person said: I would just like to say this is not scary but inspiring, unique and beautul. Because this is who you are. This is so powerful, another fan added. Someone  commented: No offence but it kinda looks like your eye is breathing but your beautul. [sic] Emma also showed off her unique party tricks – which include blowing out candles with the hole in her socket. Now, the mum is focusing on continuing her recovery, which should involve a procedure taking a chunk of skin from her leg to cover the hole in her eye socket.

At the time this picture was taken, she had spent  hours straight trying to catch a small fly in her bedroom with a hoover Image: Vanessa WardByEstel Farell-Roig:,  Sep | commentsA woman suffering with severe OCD has opened up about what le is like for her. Vanessa Ward doesnapost leave her bedroom and has been in solitary confinement for the past decade, with the simplest of tasks such as brushing her teeth taking her  minutes.The -year-old has said she feels like an empty vessel and that she is being assassinated every minute of every hour by OCD , describing the disorder as an endless stream of constant torture. Ms Ward, from Castlewellan in County Down, Northern Ireland, said she has always suffered with OCD but was able to have a semblance of a normal le up until  years ago. Have you got a story that you think we should feature  Email us at webnews@mirror She said: For the past decade, however, my le is now dictated solely by OCD - I have no le outside of it. I have lost my twenties to this debilitating illness. I have been in solitary confinement for  years and I havenapost left my bedroom. My days are spent between a bedroom and an en-suite and I have become totally isolated from all close friends and family. I am totally alone because of it and have nearly died from the isolation and loneliness OCD brings more than once. Ms Ward - who is now trying to raise funds for a specialist treatment - wrote on her GoFundMe page that her movements are now so complex and calculated that she is like in a catatonic state.I have set rules and complex rituals that must be carried out in a systematic, orderly and symmetrical way, she continued. If I donapost do this the thoughts, anxiety, nausea and terror are so much of a punishment I have no option but to comply. I do these rituals all day, every day to the point I faint on a very regular basis. I have stopped eating for weeks and on three occasions my family have had no option but have me admitted to acute mental health hospitals. On the second admission, my health was so critical that I was sectioned under the mental health act.Ms Ward - who is one of five siblings - said that her mental health has led to a deterioration in her physical health as well, going from  stone to nine stone within a year as a result of the anti-psychotic drugs that were tried during a hospital admission.She also has changes in her eyesight and suffers from hair loss and fractured teeth, together with deficiencies in potassium, folic acid, and vitamin D. While most adults having a resting heart rate between  and bpm, Ms Ward said hers is around bpm. I never get a break from the constant torture and thoughts of OCD, she continued. I can go for periods of  hours with no sleepOCD dictates it. My le has been so miserable - I have just been existing and I feel like an empty vessel. After several admissions to acute hospitals where no one could help me I just felt like dying - I wanted to die. Death is easier than this endless stream of constant torture and feeling like I am being assassinated every minute of every hour by OCD. I wanted euthanasia almost daily but my family kept trying to tell me it will get better.  Ms Wardaposs sister Priscilla said that, as a family, they can see the endless ways OCD has ruined her le. The -year-old said her sister is isolated from the outside world - with no personal relationships or any friendships - and can no longer do the simplest of things. Ms Ward now lives in a house on her own, she explained, with family members visiting her every day to bring her food and encourage her to eat.  The eldest sister said: She has been sick for so long she is now hyper sensitive to sounds and smells. A simple smoke alarm gives her an anxiety attack to the level she feels she would take a heart attack. There is no enjoyment in her le anymore and she has nothing to look forward to. She is a prisoner in her own mind. She is also painfully aware how absurd her behaviours and rituals are but OCD always over rides this and she must comply. Ms Ward said her sisteraposs OCD is a never ending cycle of floods of thoughts that cause endless anxiety and,the ritual isnapost completed, the thoughts and anxiety wonapost stop.  As the years have gone on, these rituals have become longer and more complex, she continued, to the point her sister now spends every hour of every day carrying these out. Ms Ward said her sister is crippled and completely disabled by OCD now, adding the picture of her in the bedroom was taken as she spent  hours straight trying to catch a small fly in her bedroom with the hoover. This was without a break, drink of water or sleep, she continued. Complete adrenaline caused by fear keeps this going. We, as a family, canapost even help in a scenario like this becausewe enter the bedroom we have now contaminated it and she would have to do endless streams of rituals to the point were she would be so exhausted and weak she would be fainting. We constantly feel useless, guilty, worried, hopeless, powerless and heart broken. The sister said her mum thinks Vanessa was born with OCD, not wanting to be touched or cuddled since she was a baby. Ms Ward said the OCDaposs symptoms started to accentuate when her sister was a teenager, for instance taking six hours to have a shower. Planning on an IT career, Ms Ward said her sister has only ever had a couple of summer jobs in between school years. She added: We canapost remember the last time we gave Vanessa a hug, gave her a gt, celebrated her birthday, heard her genuinely laugh or that contagious smile and care free attitude she had. Our Christmases now are opening presents without her, not having her at the dinner. We are all together while she has been sitting alone in a room or sitting in a mental health hospital listening to other patients screaming. A family gatherings or weddings, again we have the guilt and sadness that she isnapost there and is alone suffering endlessly. When wider family members inevitably ask how she is, we are all fighting back tears and the happiest of days are always tainted with sadness. She isnapost able to be with us but her tortured face is everywhere we look.  The family is now trying to raise funds for specialist treatment with a world-renowned professor in OCD which would involve staying at a private hospital for at least six months, working daily with professionals carrying out Cognitive Behavioural Therapyand Exposure And Response Prevention . Ms Ward wrote on the GoFundMe page: I had given up all hope until my family came across a world renowned Professor in OCD. They arranged a consultation with him online. He stated that my case is quite the challenge and I was waiting for the inevitable aposI donapost think I can help youapos but to my astonishment, do you know what he said to me  aposVanessa donapost give up hope because I can help youapos. I can not tell you how that felt. I just started crying uncontrollably. I couldnapost even comprehend it. I couldnapost believe it. After years of  hope and constant let downs, he can help me. The Professor has dictated that treatment needs to be started imminently as my condition will continue to plummet. What do you think about this story  Sign in and let us know in the comments below Ms Ward - who hopes to become an ambassador for OCD in the future - has so far been able to raise more than £, but her goal is £,. Her family hopes that the specialist treatment will teach Ms Ward coping mechanisms and tools to manage her OCD, said Priscilla, teaching her to notice for signs of relapse so she can prevent any further deterioration. She added: Medications at present will help to change the chemistry in the brain, but the ERP and CBT will help to change the structural pathways in her brain and how the neuro transmitters communicate. This is the last resort for Vanessa to try and get help, for her to be pulled from the never ending sea of sadness she is drowning in.

Sabina Nessa, a -year-old teacher, is thought to have been taking a five-minute route through a park at around .pm on a Friday. She did not make it. Her body was found by a passer-by the next day, hidden under a pile of leaves in Cator Park, South East London – just a stone’s throw from her home. Friends and relatives describe Sabina as a beautul soul who was always caring and kind. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said this week that between last year’s International Women’s Day and this year’s,  women in Britain were killed at the hands of men. He warned: We do have an epidemic when it comes to violence against women and girls. As a woman and a mother, I am numb with fear. My first instinct was to promote the importance of personal safety to other women.  I posted a list of the  best apps for women walking alone at night, I reminded women to be vigilant, not to bury their heads in their phones or walk around with earphones in. But that is to ignore the real issue. We do all this as routine – simply because we are women, and we are dying at the hands of men at the horric rate of three a week. It is abhorrent that, because of my gender, I can’t walk the streets with the same confidence a man can. It is abhorrent that I have to put an app on my phone to ensure my husband knows I’m safe. It is abhorrent I have to take my alarm. And it is abhorrent that,it is dark, I feel anxious by myself. ThatI see a man walking towards me I feel vulnerable – so I clutch my bag, quicken my pace and cross the road. Why should I feel like that  Why should any woman have to  So many parents have dropped their daughters off at university this week, my niece being one of them. My sister-in-law gave her the talk all parents of daughters will know: Keep your drink with you so no one spikes it, don’t go anywhere without your phone, always stick together, don’t walk alone and please, please, text me so I know you’re safe. And that was before we heard about Sabina Nessa’s murder. I’m sure that will have led to many frantic texts begging to please be careful, stay safe, don’t walk travel by yourself at night. I don’t want to be repeating all this to my daughter when she goes to university in eight years. I want there to have been signicant changes in how women are treated, so they do not fear for their safety. Some % of women say they feel unsafe or very unsafe walking alone at night in their local area. Just % of men express the same concern. For me, the single biggest change we need is the education of young men on women’s rights, on what misogyny looks and sounds like, on what equality really means. Men have a vital role in combating this. They need to know they can call it out, prevent it and stop it. How the Met Police can claim that London streets are safe beggars belief. They will only be safe when men stop attacking women – and when women can walk without fear.Most ReadFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Murder\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The abandoned park - which featured in US television shows including Top Gear America - is currently in a dilapidated state following its permanent closure in .This came after a rocky history including a serious accident that led to a former-employee becoming paralysed, together with three re-opening and subsequent closures.  Seventeen years after it was abandoned, the current state of the former family favourite has been captured in the photographs taken by Shaun, who described the abandoned waterpark as an incredibly surreal scene. In one image, the entrance to the dilapidated park can be seen almost entirely covered in graffiti – a theme which continues through the site, having clearly been frequented by visitors since its closure. In another shot, litter can be seen scattered across the grounds – including what appear to be spray paint cans. What do you think about this story  Sign in and let us know in the comments below  Meanwhile, nature has started to take over the abandoned site, with overgrown trees throughout the park. In an aerial shot, the barren land surrounding the park can be seen – stretching out into the distance. A crumbling slide can be seen in the background of one image, curling around a hill and covered in dirt. Many of the park’s slides were sold years ago, leaving large empty spaces in the once-bustling park.  “I’ve visited the park several times over the years since it was first abandoned, and each time it is slightly more decayed and weather-beaten – not to mention covered in spray paint,” Shaun, who is in his s and lives in northern Nevada, told Jam Press. “This particular visit was in mid-September  after Iaposd heard the property was listed for sale for  million – which kind of seemed like a joke, as it is so damaged itaposs hard to imagine making any al use of the structures and remains of the old waterpark that are still standing.  The Raise the Stakes Photographyaposs owner added: “A large waterpark sitting abandoned in the arid Mojave Desert is an incredibly surreal scene, and itaposs great to see people turn it into essentially a playground and guerrilla art gallery for those others who are willing to hop the fence and explore it. “The state of decay is part of the whole thing, and knowing it wonapost exist forever – whether it becomes some fancy development like the owner is hoping for with listing it for sale, or eventually just reverts to massive lot of sand like much of the other parcels out here – just makes it something to appreciateyou can catch it the window of time that it exists in this state.”  The -acre park is located in the Mojave Desert and was built by local businessman Bob Byers, who named it after his we, Dolores, opening to the public in .

The Duchess also said: The idea of representation — aposThat looks like me!apos — I wanted everyone to be included in this book.A video shared on social media shows the couple being hugged by a group of children at the school.

Timothy Satterlee Sr, , was last seen on August  checking the storm damage outside his home in Slidell, northeast of New Orleans. It was feared he had been swept away by floodwaters caused by Hurrican Ida - and eaten by an alligator. Detectives confirmed around two weeks later that an animal - weighing kg - had been captured and killed. Tests were then carried out and it has now been confirmed that remains found in the reptileaposs stomach were those of Mr Satterlee Sr.Do you have a story  Email webnews@mirror. St. Tammany Parish Coroner Dr. Charles Preston confirmed the news in a release, according to NBC.The coroneraposs office used DNA samples extracted from the remainaposs tissue and compared those to samples from Satterleeaposs sons. Investigators were then able to make an -point DNA match with Mr Satterlee’s children, reports say. For legal purposes, a -point match is the general standard, Dr Preston said in the release. In this case, given the circumstances, I am satisfied that an -point match confirms these are Mr. Satterleeaposs remains. Dr Preston added that his office have also taken hair and other samples from Mr Satterlee’s home and will try to make a full match. The animal attack happened the day after Ida struck, one of the most powerful hurricanes ever to hit the US Gulf Coast.  After slamming into Louisiana it caused devastating flooding in some areas outside a new levee and floodgate system protecting New Orleans. Mr Satterleeaposs home is not far from an area frequented by tourists who visit for swamp tours promising sightings of alligators and other wildle, Captain Lance Vitter, of St. Tammany Parish Sherfaposs Office, said previously. Alligators do not usually attack humans unless the food they have stashed has been displaced, as can occur during major storms, he said. Mr Satterleeaposs we saw a large alligator attack her husband after he had gone outside their raised home to check on the contents of their ground-level shed. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information at www.mirror email .The alligator had him in a death roll and had ripped off one of his arms, Vitter said, recounting the weaposs statement to authorities. His we, , intervened, and the alligator disappeared into the water. Bleeding badly and starting to black out, the husband told her to get in their small boat and seek help, Vitter said.

High school sweethearts Joel Forchue, , and Mickey Pagan, , met each other in Rhode Island in  when Mickey started attending the school Joel was at. They quickly took an interest in each other and started dating, staying together after high school and starting a le together. Mickey had always known she was bisexual and Joel would joke around with her, saying he was going to have aposfive wivesapos and aposbabies everywhere, of every nationalityapos. One day Mickey called his bluff and suggested they find a girlfriend. In September , Joel met Jaida Cutino, , on MeetMe, an app that allowed people to chat and make friends.  As Mickey listened to them chatting, she realised she also had common interests with Jaida. Over time, the couple would wait for Jaida to come online to chat to her and Jaida would wait for the couple. On November , , Mickey and Joel asked Jaida to be their girlfriend and shortly after, Joel got down on one knee and asked Mickey for her hand in marriage. To combat the jealousy that can arise in their relationship, the trio say they stay true to themselves and their intentions and remind each other that no one is loved more than the other.  When they have a moment of jealousy, they always reassure each other and make sure those thoughts donapost escalate. Despite their love for one another, Jaida and Joel have lost contact with members of their families over the relationship. Jaidaaposs mother no longer speaks to her and Jaida says she feels like sheaposs been disowned. Joelaposs mother also stopped talking to him, however he says the younger members of his family have been much more supportive. My family donapost agree with it, they say a man is supposed to be with one woman and thereaposs not supposed to be extra partners, said Jaida.  I used to get really upset and hurt about it because Iaposm a big family person and there was a point where I was really depressed and unhappy about the situation. I still hope one day theyaposll accept Joel and Mickey but I donapost see it moving in that direction. Sometimes my family will invite me to a party but tell me to come on my own and that I shouldnapost bring the people I love. The throuple say people tell them that theyaposre aposgoing to hellapos or that theyaposre aposungodlyapos but the trio hit back and say they go to church and pray before they eat, when they wake up and when they go to bed and feel incredibly close to God.  Being in a triad is like having two best friends and le partners instead of one, said Mickey. Weaposre never alone and thereaposs always someone  to talk to. We donapost see our relationship any dferent and go through le just like everyone . Thankfully my mum is very open and accepting, she says that she has four children now - she always used to call Joel her son and now she calls Jaida her daughter. I want people to know that weaposre all lucky, not just Joel, me and Jaida are lucky too.  People say weaposre not godly because of our relationship but weaposre incredibly close to God and try to be closer and closer every day. If one of us gets pregnant, Joel wants to get the other pregnant so we have kids at the same time and can go through the pregnancy together. We havenapost got anything planned - but at the same time itaposs kind of planned. The throuple say thereaposs no favouritism in the relationship and they all treat each other as equals. Joel and Mickey donapost let the time theyaposve spent together prior to meeting Jaida impact their relationship now. People ask us for advice or a better understanding of a polyamorous relationship but the truth is we donapost know because we didnapost plan for this, said Joel.

I get called a pimp or people tell me Iaposm a big daddy or a big man when really thereaposs three of us in the relationship. There is no handbook, all polyamorous and throuple relationships are dferent with dferent rules. Itaposs about whataposs in front of you and living in the moment - we wanted something and we got it. Being in this relationship as a straight man, Iaposve started to understand what people in the LGBT community go through. It helps me be more empathetic and talk to more people about it.

For the most part, itaposs just something we take on the chin, because the people involved are our nearest and dearest, and we want to be there to support them on their big day - but what happens when we canapost actually afford to do so  One woman has found herself in a bit of a sticky situation, after she realised she canapost actually afford to go to her own sisteraposs wedding, because the wedding is out of town and her children arenapost invited. I have three kids, two have autism, one is non verbal and has delays and other issues, which mean we need someone comfortable and trained in how to care for our child with more needs. These people are expensive, the woman explained on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum.Normally we have one babysitter on hand as well as family, but my family are going to the wedding and none of my husbands family are free the weekend of the wedding. My sister said no exceptions to the child free rule and we canapost afford the prices some babysitters arelooking for in the period of time we need them for. Unfortunately, the womanaposs husband has already told her sister he canapost go, as the wedding is during his busiest time at work, which means heaposs also too busy to look after the children while their mum is away. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here.  I canapost figure anything  out. I have tried, but we are on a very tight budget due to therapies and other medical needs our kids have, she continued. My sister is furious. She told me anyone can figure it out in the time weaposve had and that we can take the pay cutmy husband takes the week off or just hire a regular babysitter and save money that way. She went on to say that her sister warned her thatshe doesnapost show up at the wedding and stay for the duration, their relationship will change forever. The woman turned to Reddit to question whether she was in the wrong to tell her sister she couldnapost afford to make the wedding, and many suggested her sister should offer to help pay for the specialist sitter. First, itaposs called wedding invitation and not wedding command. Soyou invite people you must be prepared that they wonapost come, one Reddit user wrote. Second, the price of a child free wedding is, that people wonapost make it. She canapost have it all. Another commented: Your sister is within her right to have a child-free wedding, but she needs to understand that may put her guests that have children in a dficult position, since their children are pretty much their top priority. Take a paycut, get any old regular babysitter for your kids with special needs, and prioritise her wedding  Really Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

There is, of course, the excitement of bringing a child into the world, mixed with panic, fear, anxiety and pretty much every emotion you can experience. So, you canapost even imagine all the thoughts and feelings that would be flooding through your head after discovering youaposre six months pregnant, without a single warning sign, meaning youaposve only got three months to prep for parenthood. Thataposs exactly what happened to one woman, when she took a random pregnancy test after both her sister and best friend commented on how she seemed aposdferent lately.aposTikTok user Nydia Maritza, who goes by the name of @nydiamv on the app, explained how she wasnapost at all concerned while waiting for the results to show up on the test, cause I was on birth control and had my period three weeks prior, had NO symptoms and wasnapost showing.Three minutes later, however, she saw a huge apos+apos sign pop up on the test, sending her into a panic as she booked an appointment with the doctor for the following week. When she arrived at her appointment, the nurse told Nydia she looked no more than six weeks after pushing on her belly with her hands.

However, after starting the ultrasound, the nurse had to go and get a doctor to confirm that she was, in fact  weeks pregnant, going on , with the scan revealing a whole baby with limbs, toes, facial features etc. Realising I only have three months to mentally, emotionally and physically prepare myself for welcoming a baby Iaposve only known about for  minutes, Nydia added, with a terried expression on her face. In a follow up clip, the mum-of-one shared a series of photos of herself throughout her pregnancy, explaining how her body didnapost change at all until around seven months, when her belly popped aposovernight.apos  Nydia then went on to explain how she pulled a Kylie Jennerby not telling anyone about her pregnancy until her son was born, later sharing an adorable photo of his feet on Facebook.The reason I decided to keep my pregnancy private, aside from close family and friends, was because I only had three months to prepare, emotionally, physically, mentally, the whole shebang, she said. I had to prep the room the nursery, all that kind of stuff and it was a very peaceful three months, Iaposd do it all over againI could.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Ronnie Henry was looking forward to munching down on his smoked ham and mature cheese sub, from Tesco Express in Eastfield, Wolverhampton, when he made the grim discovery. I was horried when I saw it. I took it out of the packaging and for some reason I looked underneath it, not sure what prompted me to do that, he recalled.And there was a piece of brown stuff that literally looks like cat or fox faeces. I got straight in touch with them on Twitter and I’ve taken it back to the store for it to go off to be investigated. After finding the mysterious brown lump, Ronnie took to Twitter to complain, prompting others to suggest it looked like cat s***. Bought a ham and cheese sub from @Tesco, anyone got an idea what the f**k this is that was stuck in the bread  he tweeted. Might be something to do with the bread but looks like cat s**t to me.

Cat turd, one wrote, while another added: Looks like cat s*** for f*** sake. In an email to Ronnie, Tesco has since apologised for the mystery finding, and has vowed to investigate how the alleged cat poop made its way into the sandwich and onto store shelves. I am very sorry to learn that you found this inside your sub and I understand the concern caused by this. We take great pride in providing our customers with the best quality of products, so to hear this has disappointed me, they wrote.

The C-A Globemaster III cruised over Brisbane in Australia, following the path of the cityaposs river and wending its way past buildings. Even though the flight, which took place on Thursday as a practice run for the finale of the Brisbane Festival today, was advertised ahead of time, some were left shaken.NBC senior executive Mike Sington saw the footage on Twitter and said it brought him back to  .Posting a video, he said: No, no, no, just no. A Royal Australian Air Force jet weaves through the skyscrapers of downtown Brisbane, on purpose. It was a rehearsal for an air show, causing immediate flashbacks to  .Did you witness the flypast  Get in touch at webnews@mirrorA C- pilot in the US Air Force told Task  Purpose the spectacle would never have happened in the United States.“If the crew’s timing is off orthey are slow to react, the jet would collide with a building. Very risky,” the anonymous pilot said. “Those Brisbane videos are insane. We could never do something like that.” Others suggested that the flight was not actually as risky as it looks at first, with the angle of the video giving the impression itaposs closer to the buildings than it is.  Australian reporter Chad Ryan said: “It’s not immediately discernible in the angle in this video, but that plane is flying above a river that runs through the city. Not weaving in between buildings. Also it was widely publicised before it occurred so people weren’t caught off guard. The Australian air force carried out two flypasts, with one at , feet and the other as low as  feet at points. In a statement, officials said : Safety, noise management and the environment are vital considerations in the planning and conduct of Defence flying activities.Participating squadrons will operate with a view to minimising the impact on local communities.

The company’s chief executive, Stéphane Bancel, said a boost in vaccine production should mean enough jabs for “everyone on this Earth” by the middle of next year. He said booster shots would be available soon, as would jabs for infants. With the vaccine industry as a whole expanding production, “enough doses should be available by the middle of next year so that everyone on this Earth can be vaccinated”, he said. Mr Bancel added: “Those who do not get vaccinated will immunise themselves naturally, because the Delta iant is so contagious. He continued to the Swiss newspaper Neue Zuercher Zeitung : “In this way we will end up in a situation similar to that of the flu. You can either get vaccinated and have a good winter. Or you donapost do it and risk getting sick and possibly even ending up in hospital.Asked whether that could spell a “ to normal” next year, he replied: “As of today, in a year, I assume.”According to figures published by Our World In Data, . per cent of the world’s population has received at least one dose of a Covid vaccine. In low-income countries, only . per cent of people have received at least one dose, while countries with the highest incomes are getting vaccinated more than  times faster. On Tuesday, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres slammed wealthy countries for hoarding jabs and called on the world to “wake up” to the greatest “cascade of crises” in our letime. “A majority of the wealthier world vaccinated. Over  per cent of Africans still waiting for their first dose,” he said. “This is a moral indictment of the state of our world. It is an obscenity.” Colombian President Ivan Duque joined Mr Guterres’ calls at the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, and said the international community must equitably distribute jabs to avoid the creation of new, more fearsome iants of the coronavirus.“It is our moral duty,” he said during his speech to the th assembly on Tuesday. Some countries have acquired enough doses for six or seven times their population and have announced third booster doses, he added, while others have not been able to administer any shots. In the UK, booster jabs are currently being offered to the over-s, younger adults with health conditions and frontline health and care workers.

The Well of Barhout in Yemen is shunned by many locals who believe it is a source of eternal bad luck. Located in Yemen’s eastern province of Al-Mahra, the enormous hole in the desert floor spans ft wide and plunges a staggering ft below ground. The cave, thought to be millions of years old, is said to give of strange odours - with tales of the damned and aposnonbelieversapos being sent there in an afterle. A team of Omani explorers decided to explore what really lay at the bottom of the mysterious wonder - making the eerie descent to its floor. Mohammed al-Kindi, a geology professor at the German University of Technology in Oman, told AFP: There were snakes, but they won’t bother you unless you bother them. “Some say it is where apostates and nonbelievers are tortured after death. Others believe that their heads would be severed once they’re down there.” The team of cavers collected samples from its depts, and shed more light on what lay waiting for them at the bottom.  Prof al-Kindi added: We collected samples of water, rocks, soil and some dead animals but have yet to have them analysed. “We noticed strange things inside. We also smelled something strange … It’s a mysterious situation.” Stunning images from inside the cave show millions of years of sedimentary rock circling its walls. Light pouring in from the entrance also appears to illuminate the caveaposs surface, creating a shimmering, luminescent effect. A report of the teamaposs full findings is due to be made public when finalised.

But her boyfriend, who hasnapost been named, decided to place a tube of the toxic glue alongside it due to the baking heat in the country. He fetched what he thought was her medicine to help with the tricky process before she screamed and he released his horrying mistake. They could not tell the dference between the glue and the drops, which have similar names in Portuguese aposcolaapos and aposcolirioapos.  Regina is now recovering at home after the ordeal. The two plastic containers are similar in size, and as neither of them were wearing their glasses at the time, it was reported.  At the time of the incident, Regina tilted her head back and opened her eyes wide as her boyfriend squeezed what he thought was her eye drops directly into her eye. She said: The moment the drops hit my eye, I felt an intense burning sensation. I thought my eye was going to explode.  She was taken to a local hospital, where doctors used a serum and cotton to try to alleviate her pain. Ophthalmologist Liana Tito told UOL: When chemical products such as superglue, or even alcohol gel, which happens quite frequently, fall in the eye region, the eyelid can be affected by chemical burns. She added that the burns can also affect the cornea and conjunctiva. Regina was discharged the same day, but she said the pain made it impossible for her to sleep. She said: I had tears running down my cheeks all night. The glue stuck to the cilium region can form a crust, which rubs against the cornea causing extensive lesions. If for some reason these lesions evolve, they cause bacterial ulcers and then become lesions with imminent risks of perforation and blindness. She then paid another visit to the ophthalmologist, who reopened her eye and used scissors and tweezers to try to remove the traces of superglue. The doctor explained: The glue stuck to the cilium region can form a crust, which rubs against the cornea causing extensive lesions. It is not clearshe will suffer any long-term damage to her eye.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Hospitals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Jitender Gogi, one of Delhi’s most wanted gangsters who was involved in several criminal cases and jailed at Tihar since last year, was one of those fatally shot inside Rohini court. He was transported to hospital, where he was declared dead.According to reports fromNDTV India , the two other men killed in the crossfire involving the gang members and police , were gangsters who had come to the court intending to kill Gogi.Both the attackers, reportedly named Rohit and Morish, had dressed as lawyers before barging into an ongoing hearing in Court Room No.  to shoot Gogi, who was from a rival group going by the name ‘Tillu gang’. As soon as Gogi entered the same room, both the attackers started firing at him. Police then retaliated, shooting and killing them on the spot. According to an eyewitness, a female law intern also sustained bullet injuries as a result of the crossfire. Delhi Police Commissioner Rakesh Asthana told NDTV that two people from a rival gang had opened fire at Jitender Gogi, prompting police to retaliate and shoot the two assailants. “The police acted swtly and killed both the assailants. Total three dead, including Gogi,” said Mr Asthana. The incident marks a huge security lapse on court premises. Questions had incidentally been raised about whether metal detectors at the court were working andthey were, how the armed men could get past. “We are already investigating the case and we shall not spare anyone who is involved in this shootout. No one will be spared,” Mr Asthana said. He added: “Delhi Police is doing its job seriously. We were effective and focused and that is why the shooter was successfully neutralised. We will say more after a detailed investigation is carried out.” Tillu gang and Gogi’s gang had reportedly been at war for years. More than  people had reportedly died in their clashes. Gogi, born Jitender Mann, was arrested in March last year and was considered a big catch for the Delhi police.

Princess Mako aposs marriage has been delayed for years because of controversy over her fiance.The -year-old granddaughter of then-Emperor Akihito announced her engagement to college classmate Kei Komuro back in .However, the wedding was put off after reports of a financial dispute between Komuroaposs mother and her former fiance. In the midst of public criticism over her fiance, it has now been reported that the government is set to agree that the princess forego the payment, worth up to  million yen , for royals giving up their status to marry commoners, reports Reuters. Japanese public broadcaster NHK is reporting that the wedding date could be announced as early as next month.

as council chiefs ponder future public transport access to the Granite Mile.City planners have been sent back to the drawing board to work out how to improve the city centre, as all acknowledge drastic action is needed to bring people in.Potential pedestrianisation of the Bridge Street to Market Street stretch of Union Street is on the table as part of the £ million refresh of the city centre masterplan.But the suggestion that buses would have to bypass Aberdeen#s seven busiest bus stops in the long term has caused outrage.Now, the administration#s lead spokeswoman on the city centre masterplan, Councillor Marie Boulton, has revealed roads chiefs could well roll back the years and reclaim the Castlegate for public transport use # while being #realistic# about what can be achieved.Pedestrianised in the early s, the historic market area is currently under used # and the local authority wants to make more of it as a link to between the city centre and beach.Mrs Boulton said: #We have discussed a Castlegate bus terminus and suggested we might look at the merit at making it a turning circle again for the buses, or a stopping pointdrivers need to catch up on timetables.#That certainly will feature as a possible solution.#Connectivity is the biggest challenge we have and connections between the city centre and the beach are going to be paramount.#How we go through the Castlegate and connect to the beach is going to be really important, so I am excited to see what innovations the council can come up with.#Reintroduction of buses to the cobbled square surrounding the th Century Mercat Cross could go some way to appeasing the city#s major transport firms.Only last month, bosses at Stagecoach and First Aberdeen united in their calls for an urgent end to the ban on buses in Union Street.A central stretch of the city#s main thoroughfare has been closed since early in the pandemic, as part of a £. million physical distancing project.Planners are looking at permanent pedestrianisation however, blocking a clear run up the Granite Mile for all but walkers, cyclists and, potentially, some bus services.Peter Knight, Stagecoach managing director, and David Phillips, operations director at First Aberdeen, revealed #frustrations# at the prolonged closure.They claimed buses had been stuck in traffic four times as long since the workaround ersion through the bus gate at Market Street was put in place.And while their exile from Union Street remains, Aberdeen Journals has been told the council is exploring ways of accommodating buses again # evenfull scale, long term pedestrianisation is voted through.However, while buses could be allowed to share the space with walkers and cyclists like in Broad Street, the council could encourage #creative timetabling# to keep Union Street open.#There would be nothing worse than pedestrianising between Bridge Street and Market Street and then having it constantly blocked with buses,# Mrs Boulton told us.#Frequency of buses is quite important and that is a conversation we would need to have with the operators.#We have to be realistic about the way our city is laid out as we don’t have the same parallel streets as Edinburgh and Glasgow to be able to do what they have.#Buses play a vital role for many people, particularly those on lower incomes to access the city centre or for those without a car, and the older population who like to come in to the city centre during the day #

Many of these are linked to previous and devastating trauma and are only made worse by the circumstances they are forced to live in.Part of our work at Crisis is to ensure our clients have the psychological support they need to establish a le away from homelessness. Keeping this going through the pandemic has been a real challenge and Crisis staff have been finding all sorts of creative solutions.In the early days of the pandemic our coaches worked rapidly to provide phones, tablets, laptops and data to our clients who needed it and adapted our services, including our psychological support, so we could provide a continued leline over the phone and online.With lockdown and restrictions now eased, it is a relief for our clients to feel less of the added mental pressure that we#ve had from the circumstances of the last year and for face-to-face support to be more of an option again.Whether in person or online, all our work is only made possible by the fantastic people and organisations who support us, meaning we can continue to help people across the country to leave homelessness behind for good.On behalf of Crisis and the thousands of people we support each year, we would particularly like to thank the players of People’s Postcode Lottery, across Scotland and where, who have helped fund the vital work of our clinical psychologists in such dficult times.Peter Oakes, lead clinical psychologist at CrisisSir,Recent disruptions with our ferry service from Islay to the mainland have once again shown us just how much we depend on a fit-for-purpose service with reliable, newer vessels in operation.Unfortunately this is currently not the case as our ferry fleet has been underfunded for many years,not decades, as a result of decisions made by urban-centric central government.Our frontline CalMac ferry crews and port staff are hard-working and an asset to our island and mainland communities, however they can only work with the tools they have at hand.The -year-old MV Hebridean Isles is one of the oldest in the state-owned fleet and while it was no doubt good in its day that day has passed a long time ago. Problems with our Islay ferry service have also been exacerbated with the continued poaching of one of our ferries in the summer months for other areas that CalMac operates in.On numerous occasions, distillers on Islay said they were facing major problems in transporting whisky to the Scottish mainland because of a capacity crisis on the ferry links.The feeling amongst many of my constituents is that it is we on Islay, Jura and Colonsay who always end up getting a raw deal.This simply cannot be allowed to continue.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,Thanks to funding from the Scottish Power Foundation, an Argyll and Bute scheme is offering young people a new route to gaining employment and skills in heritage.Heritage Horizons, run by the Culture, Heritage and Arts Assembly, Argyll and Isles , and Argyll and Bute Heritage and Museums Forum, aims to address the issue of an ageing workforce in the heritage and museums sectors by offering skill-building opportunities for young people.The project will work with Argyll heritage venues in areas of high unemployment, developing  accredited placements for young people.

St Peter#sSt Peter#s win - on penaltiesRed Star welcomed St Peter#s to the Ropework last Saturday for their Scottish Cup first round tie and were disappointed to exit the competition after an even contest ended - after  minutes.There weren#t many chances created by either side despite the best efforts of the players with defences largely on top.Star’s best efforts came from distance with Fraser Talbot going close to opening the scoring on a couple of occasions.St Peter’s most likely route to goal was from set-pieces which caused Star a few minor problems early on, but left Jake Weir largely untroubled in the Star goal.The sides exchanged goals late in the first half.Star took the lead from a typically wicked Craig Aitken corner which caused a mixup in the St Peter#s defence and the ball bundled in off a visitors# defender.Star couldn’t hold the lead till the break and St Peter#s were back on even terms after a rare lapse in the Star backline Jake Weir did well to save the initial effort but the St Peter#s winger reacted sharpest to score from close range. -.The second half was once again proving to be a tight affair with neither keeper really being troubled and it was no surprise that the game ended up going to penalty kicks.It was the visitors who edged the shootout with Coll McCallum and Craig Aitken being the unfortunate players to see their kicks saved after Andy Weir and Lee MacLean had scored.St Peter#s made no mistake with their four kicks and booked their place in the next round of the cup.Although disappointed to go out, Star will be delighted to finally play a League game for the first time in  months tomorrow as they travel to Parklea to face Port Glasgow OBU."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor september 10 2021","story":" Updated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMore Commercial TreesSirI refer to the letter from Mick Bottomley of Forestry and Land Scotland in the August  edition of the Advertiser, where he puts forward the case for more commercial trees.I am very respectful of the timber industry#s important place in the Scottish economy and understand the need to pursue and develop such commercial opportunities in this area for landowners businesses.To balance the growth of the industry of trees for timber I would, however, hope that in turn greater respect is paid to the impact on the landscape the way the land is left after felling and the way the logs are transported.To take the A for example, a road that is promoted for tourism by government marketing initiatives and signs indicating a scenic route .Along the way, you pass and see great swathes of Sitka Spruce or, worse, ugly and bleak areas of devastation where they have been felled.This is while you avoid oncoming log lorries, at times along a very narrow road or, indeed, get stuck behind one.I would suggest thatwe need more commercial trees , we also need greater sensitivity shown and responsibility taken regarding the locations used, the management of the areas and transport.A start would be the edging of the road and forests with mixed deciduous trees so screening areas, particularly when felled,  and to take as much of the transport of logs off lorries and onto the water.Such steps would show some respect to the touristand to the local population.Name and address suppliedSirNew NHS Scotland workforce statistics published on September  show nursing and midwery vacancies have been at a record high since March, with more than , posts unfilled.The statistics show that, as of June , , nursing and midwery posts were vacant, this represents .% of all posts.They also show that in the previous quarter , ,posts were unfilled.

Academics agree that a sustainable level of material use, which would still allow for a high quality of le, is about eight tonnes per person per year.Zero Waste Scotland is advocating for mindful shopping, encouraging Scots to buy smarter and adopt reuse, repair and renting behaviours as well as embracing second-hand shopping.When finished with an item, it is calling on people to dispose of items responsibly by donating, reselling or recycling.With global climate change discussions at an all-time high and COP coming to Glasgow this November, the topic of responsible consumption in relation to the climate crisis has never been more timely.Everything we buy has a carbon cost and we are urging Scots to think dferently about what we buy and how we consume.Changing our own consumption habits is the single biggest thing we can all do to play our part in tackling climate change.Now is the time for action and we want people to bin less and buy better, seeking out items which will last longer.Responsible consumption isn’t on the COP agenda so we wanted to ensure it is top of the consumer agenda.To learn more about the campaign, please visit www.howtowasteless for further details.Iain Gulland, chief executive, Zero Waste Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters does genetic tolerance aid wild swimmers","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowWild swimming has become increasingly popular during lockdown, but in general people are ided into those who love swimming in cold water and those who think that it’s complete madness.Now scientists have found a possible explanation for this ision related to a muscle protein called alpha-actinin- .We have two types of muscle fibres # type  and type .Type  fibres provide fatigue resistance important for prolonged, submaximal activity like marathon running, while type  fibres produce a rapid and powerful force for short-burst, vigorous activities such as sprinting.The two types of fibres respond dferently to cold exposure # type  fibres produce an involuntary, low-intensity, continuous increase in muscle tone, while type  fibres give bursts of high-intensity activity causing overt shivering.ACTN is only active in type  muscle fibres, and deficiency of this protein is caused by a non-ing ACTN gene.This occurs in - per cent of the world’s population, around . billion people, and is most common in Europe and Asia.These people lack type  muscle fibre activity and although this is compensated by having larger type  fibres, it adversely affects muscle , impacting on athletic performance, particularly in sprint and power activities.Now scientists have investigated the role of ACTN in cold tolerance .Male participants,  with ing and  with non-ing ACTN, were immersed in water at °C for -minute periods interspersed with -minute rest periods at room temperature .The ordeal ended either after a maximum of six immersions or when participants’ body temperature dropped to .°C.The scientists found improved cold tolerance in those with non-ing ACTN, some  per cent of whom maintained body temperature above .°C compared to  per cent of those with al ACTN.So those lacking al type  fibres had better cold tolerance, suggesting that cold-induced increased muscle tone is more efficient at generating heat than overt shivering.Improved cold tolerance probably gave our ancestors an evolutionary survival advantage after their migration from Africa to colder climes in Eurasia, so explaining the high frequency of non-ing ACTN in today’s northern populations.It would be interesting to investigate how many Scottish wild swimmers carry this genetic iant.

Healthy trees are being protected during the works and will remain.The same stone recently used to resurface Colchester Square # Achnaba stone quarried locally by MacLeod Construction Ltd # will be installed on the new public square area, with electrical installation for the square also anticipated in the autumn.The historic drinking fountain close to the public toilet block has been dismantled, to be reinstated later in the project.The front green scheme is expected to be complete by early .Lochgilphead is also seeing investment in shop front improvements, supported by the council, and the town centre Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme is just getting underway.Structural and service works are almost complete as part of a redevelopment of Mid Argyll Community Pool by owner Mid Argyll Community Enterprises Ltd , allowing fit-out and finishing over the next couple of months.MacLeod Construction Ltd began work in March on the MACPool Activity Hub which, when completed, will offer soft play, an all-access café and multi-use rooms for hire in addition to improved changing facilities for the pool.The project, due for completion in October, is going to plan despite materials supply challenges faced by the building industry.Unforeseen complications in the build have also caused minor delays, but MacLeod Construction is finding ways around these hurdles and the MACEL Board is hopeful that swimmers can be welcomed back by the second half of December.All aspects of the new Activity Hub should be up and running early next year, and MACPool manager Fiona MacAlpine is going to be recruiting some new team members in the coming weeks.MACEL chair Kim Ritchie said: #Thanks to the many organisations and iniduals who have supported the project financially, all funds for the main build and basic fit-out of the Hub are in place.#But there is still a need for funds to complete the fit-out and landscape and furnish the external area.#Soyou haven’t yet contributed and would like to # it’s not too late.There are two community sponsorship schemes, one for local businesses and one for iniduals – the Sponsor Our Seascape program.

He recalled: ‘We were out on a day sailing on the Dasher when she blew up and sank. They lost more than  men that day. And I lost my tools.’It was after the second world war that Peter realised his ambition of running his own electrical company.He had started his electrical apprenticeship in  at the age of  with the Campbeltown and Mid Argyll Electrical Supply Company, and by  he was ready to set up shop in Argyll Street, moving to Colchester Square in the s by which time he and his business partner Davie Wilson employed  members of staff,  working from Campbeltown to Strontian and on Islay, Mull, Coll and Tiree.Peter recalled the start of his career: ‘I used to leave at am, get my rolls in the morning before travelling up to get the ferry to Craignure on Mull,  then I’d take a bus to get the ferry over to Iona and then make the trip back home again. It was very hard work but it’s just what you did back then.’It was also at the end of the war that Peter married a woman he had met while working at the Clyde shipyards. His we Anne was from a family of  children brought up in Kilmacolm.Speaking at Peter#s birthday celebration, his daughter Margaret Loughran said: #My dad, his parents and his sisters Maria and Netta were given a really warm welcome when they moved to Lochgilphead in the s.#There were hardly any other families from outside Scotland living here at that time so they were always really grateful to have been accepted into the community.#I think that#s why Dad worked so hard over the years to support the church and the community more generally.#"},{"url":null,"title":"new argyll shop local gift card set for launch","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowA new gt card is coming soon to help Argyll businesses emerge from the pandemic with the help of local residents.The Argyll and Bute love local gt card will allow holders to enjoy a fantastic range of products, services and experiences on offer across the area, including hotel stays, gts, clothing, dining, household goods, groceries and services such as garages and accountants.Businesses are being encouraged to register for the Scottish Government-backed scheme to stimulate increased local spending and help protect jobs across Argyll and Bute.A map and listings of all registered businesses will appear on a dedicated Argyll and Bute webpage on the Scotland Gts Local website when the card launches next month.The gt cards will be sold online via the Scotland Gts Local , which allows people from all over the world to order a card.An ever-growing number of Argyll and Bute businesses are signing up, including cafes, bookshops, opticians, tourist attractions, gt shops and supermarkets.The scheme is being delivered by Scotland’s Towns Partnership , which is behind the Scotland Loves Local Campaign with funding from the Scottish Government and endorsed by Argyll and Bute Council.Visit www.lovelocal.scot gtcard to find out more about the Scotland Loves Local gt card, including details on how to sign up.Councillor Robin Currie, policy lead for the economy and rural growth, said: #The gt card scheme presents an excellent opportunity to support our local businesses as they continue to recover from the impact of COVID.#It has the potential to generate signicant spending across Argyll and Bute’s economy, helping secure jobs and build a more sustainable future for the region’s communities.#We would encourage all businesses across Argyll and Bute to sign up # this is the perfect way for people to show their support for their local traders particularly in the run-up to the Christmas shopping period.#Scotland’s minister for community wealth, Tom Arthur MSP, said the Scottish Government was #delighted to be backing this innovative scheme#, adding: #The gt card is a quick and efficient way to encourage spend and drive sales growth in our local economies.#The Argyll and Bute gt card is one of , unique to each region of Scotland, and can only be spent in businesses located in the region.[Would you box the following please and set in body of copy ]"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week september 24 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowI had the wonderful privilege the other week of holding a new grandson for the first time.Isn#t it amazing how a new-born infant can grab hold of your heart  I was filled with so much love and pride and I prayed that his le would be blessed.It so happened that the Gospel reading set for the Sunday after I met my grandson was, in part at least, about a little child.​Mark tells us Jesus was walking ahead of his disciples on the way to Capernaum. When they got there Jesus asked them: #What were you arguing about along the way #They couldn#t answer, for they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest. They were silent, because they#d been caught out.Then Jesus took a little child in his arms and said to them: #Whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me, welcomes not me but the one who sent me.#Greatness, Jesus was saying to them, is found in welcoming and receiving into our arms someone vulnerable, powerless and dependent, regardless of age.Greatness is found not in what we have accomplished but in what we have done and given to #the least of these#, the hungry, thirsty, naked, sick, and imprisoned: the symbolic children in each of our lives.Greatness never makes itself superior over another. It is not about me, my job, my reputation, my status.

There simply isn’t space to accommodate everybody, so there is a degree of compromise.#There are opportunities for season tickets, but that does come at a cost as part of the council process. There are proposals for permits for businesses as well as residents.Councillor Lorna Douglas said there was #real concern# where staff who were not on high salaries could have to pay for a permit costing more than £.She added: #Luss is not an easy place to get to. I know people who work there and do car pools, but to me, £ for a permit is massive.#Stuart Watson, the council’s traffic and development manager, replied: #Businesses can get two permits which can be for staff as well.

We were delighted to welcome them to Argyll for their first performance as a quartet and for three of the four performers this was the first time they had performed in more than a year.The quartet # Andrew, Dean, Jack and Richard # introduced each piece, giving background to both the role of the saxophone and the composer, with many of the pieces arranged by the group themselves.Purcell’s #Festival Rondeau# was the dramatic opening, a work well-known across all age groups, so a perfect start to the concert.Following this was a work composed specically for a saxophone quartet in  by Jean-Baptiste Singelée, a friend of Adolph Sax who invented the saxophone. We were treated to the traditional Andante before moving onto the exciting Allegro.The third selection of pieces were all by Debussy. This was a surprising choice as the saxophone is not really associated with the Impressionist period, however, it showed the versatility of both the saxophones and performers. #Arabesque No.# was followed by #The Little Shepherd# which was delightful, calm and serene with only the sound of the river flowing through the trees and birds singing along. The jaunty #Cakewalk# completed this ied section.#Air on a G String# by Bach and known to many as a TV advert was the next offering. The opening descending bass line showed the depth and quality of the baritone saxophone in much more than just a supporting role. This music predates the invention of the saxophone by more than  years.Gershwin and a selection of show tunes from the swing era were just what we needed after the relaxing #Air#. The four musical songs, all showcasing dferent styles, certainly had the audience smiling, toe-tapping and singing along. In the final piece #I Got Rhythm# we were all moving to the music, including the quartet. Closing your eyes, you could imagine you were relaxing in a jazz club anywhere in the world.The next piece, #L’Arlesienne Exhibition#, is a collection of highlights for the saxophone in an orchestral situation. The music was composed by Hiroki Takahashi, with many familiar themes from film and TV # including The Apprentice # all thoroughly enjoyable.Gershwin’s #An American in Paris# portrays the many sights and sounds that Gershwin experienced there in the s. While it was composed for an orchestra which included saxophones and car horns, the music played by the quartet didn’t include any car horns # just skilled and imaginative saxophonists.A change of pace to enjoy some relaxed, laid-back music from West Africa followed with Will Gregory’s #High Le#. The repeated rhythms with the peace of Kilmory, the cooling air and the gentle river flowing was almost hypnotic and brought the concert to a finish.The audience cheered, clapped and blew their cars horns to ensure the quartet provided an encore. #Witch Hunt# by Ulrich Schultheiss was the encore # a dramatic and fiery work challenging all the performers and bringing a fantastic concert to a close.The quartet members themselves didn#t feel the cars were a barrier and said they #had a blast at a unique and special event#.MAAA thank the th Argyll Scoutsfor helping with the car parking. Traffic cones and hi-vis waistcoats were loaned by MacLeods and the wagon we used as a stage was from Ferguson#s Butchers. Picnic boxes were pre-ordered from Lucy’s Ardfern.

address supply issues in the lead up to Christmas, according to business groups.The Government has announced a temporary visa scheme that will see , HGV drivers and , poultry workers allowed to take up employment in the UK until Christmas Eve, in a bid to keep supermarket shelves stocked with turkeys and tackle delivery dficulties at petrol stations.The intervention came amid scenes of y queues at petrol stations after a shortage of fuel tanker drivers forced some retailers to shut their pumps and ration sales.But the British Retail Consortium and the British Chamber of Commerce criticised the scope of the package of measures revealed by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps on Saturday, which were seen by some as a step back from the Prime Ministerrsquos ambitions to create a high-wage, high-skilled post-Brexit economy.Mr Shapps said the changes, with short-term visas available from next month, would ldquoensure preparations remain on track for the festive season.Chamber president Baroness McGregor-Smith, however, said consumers and businesses faced ldquoanother less than happy Christmas due to the visa offer being ldquoinsufficient.Retailers had previously warned the Government that it had just  days to save Christmas from ldquosignicant disruption due to a shortfall of about , drivers in the freight sector.vw,vw,px, px\"Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the temporary visa offer would help keep Christmas lsquoon trackrsquo The Conservative peer said: ldquoEventhese short-term opportunities attract the maximum amount of people allowed under the scheme, it will not be enough to address the scale of the problem that has now developed in our supply chains.ldquoThis announcement is the equivalent of throwing a thimble of water on a bonfire.Andrew Opie, a director at the British Retail Consortium, said the limit of , HGV visas would do ldquolittle to alleviate the current shortfall and called for visas to be extended to ldquoall sectors of the retail industry.He added: ldquoSupermarkets alone have estimated they need at least , HGV drivers for their businesses to be able to operate at full capacity ahead of Christmas and avoid disruption or availability issues.The relaxation of immigration rules was welcomed by other industry groups, however, with Food and Drink Federation chief Ian Wright calling the measures ldquopragmatic, while Logistics UK said it showed Government had listened to hauliersrsquo concerns.Richard Walker, managing director at Iceland supermarket, called the announcement ldquocritical and pushed for shop staff and other key workers to be fast-tracked past petrol pump queues.The supermarket boss said: ldquoUntil this eases, key workers including food retail workers need to be prioritised at the pumps so that we can keep hospitals operating and food shops open, and the nation safe and fed.As well as the visa changes, the Department for Transportsaid it planned to train , more lorry drivers through both a pound million investment in skills camps and established adult education budgets, with some of those studying for HGV licences eligible to have their courses paid for by the state.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defencewill be stepping in to provide examiners for lorry driving tests as ministers look to steadily increase the size of the workforce.Officials said the loan of MoD examiners to work alongside Driver and Vehicle Standards Agencyemployees would help put on ldquothousands of extra tests over the next  weeks.The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated a global shortage of lorry drivers, although there have been long-term issues in the UK with vacancy numbers amid an ageing workforce, low wages and poor truck stop conditions.In a drive to encourage people toto the industry, nearly one million letters will be landing on the doormats of people with HGV licences in the coming days enticing them to give the job another go.The letter will set out the steps the haulage sector is taking to improve industry conditions, including increased wages, flexible working and fixed hours, according to the DfT.Officials said the Government was focused on raising pay and improving working conditions and ersity of the workforce, rather than relying on cheap foreign workers to fill vacancies in the long run.The DfT said it recognised that importing foreign labour ldquowill not be the

It was the first of the many tensions between his inner and outer selves that Toibin attempts to portray.Telling the story of a Nobel Prize-winning writer in a novel that spans his le is a mammoth and fraught task. It expects fiction to do the work of biography, yet with imaginative licence. The focus zooms in and out, crisp and prosaic in this passage, lingeringly descriptive in another. The reader must absorb the outline of Mannrsquos CV, while trusting the author to convey its subjectrsquos mind.Readers unfamiliar with Mann, who have perhaps only seen the film of Death in Venice, are in a better position than experts. No need to question facts, or interpretations, or wonder what sources Toibin used to come to his conclusions. For instance, Toibin tells us that Mannrsquos journals were destroyed before the Nazis could read them and learn of his proclivities. As Mann frets over their discovery ndashthey described his arousal at the sight of his naked son and his attraction to a teenage boy ndash it is unclearthis is a novelistic flourish, or rooted in truth. In a work whose essence is to capture the soul of a giant of th-century letters, such uncertainty is unsettling and troubling.Toibinrsquos acclaimed novel about Henry James, The Master, focused on a five-year period. The Magician, by comparison, covers almost three-quarters of a century, from Mannrsquos conventional upbringing in strait-laced Lubeck, to his final years in the USA, where he had fled to escape Hitler and his cronies.The opening chapters require concentration, and there is a stilted quality to the writing and a staginess to the dialogue that makes it hard ever to forget you are reading about a real person. It is a wholly perplexing novel, raising questions that are not answered. Yet the bones of the story are fascinating, no matter how told. The young Thomas Mann had no doubt that he was to become a writer. Nor that he was sexually drawn to men. In a far-sighted act of self-preservation, he marries the vivacious, high-born Katia Pringsheim. It proves to be an affectionate and contented union, with Katia tacitly understanding her husbandrsquos longings. The couple produce six children, enough to deflect suspicions about the novelistrsquos orientation, even after the homoerotic yearning he evokes in Death in Venice.Nicknamed the Magician by his children, with whom he is by turns playful and aloof, Toibinrsquos Mann is unknowable and opaque, passing like a sleepwalker through much of this book. A devoted patriot, he is devastated by Germanyrsquos defeat in the First World War. Resentment and bitterness cloud his judgement for too long. While his older children, especially the twins Erika and Klaus, are alive to the threat Hitler poses, he is slow to respond. It takes Nazi hecklers at one of his lectures to show how far his country has changed: ldquoHis own exalted literary reputation did not place him in an unassailable position, he realises. It is also clear that the Germany of which he remained proud ldquohad lost its place at the centre. Even so, he resists speaking out, for fear of the consequences for his wersquos Jewish parents, and his publisher. The prospect of his books being banned, of losing his readers, is unbearable.In the end, he steels himself. In denouncing the barbarism of Nazism, he decides to adopt a grandiose, theatrical tone: ldquohe would shower clause and subclause upon them. It is a rare moment of humour.After  pages, around the middle of the book, The Magician finally sparks into le, feeling less like a resume of the familyrsquos fortunes, and lingering on scenes that offer an insight, albeit fleeting, into the always contradictory Mann.Much follows, as the Manns flee to the USA and, on the eve of war, help family to extricate themselves ndash or not ndash from Europe. Erika joins them in America, where she writes a cabaret mocking the National Socialist Party: ldquoIf everyone did what I am doing, then Hitler would soon be painting our hallways at less than the going rate. Bisexual, like her father ndash her brother is gay ndash she makes a marriage of convenience with WH Auden. She is an often insufferable presence but, unlike the fictionalised Mann, could never be accused of being dull.Only rarely does Toibinrsquos version feel persuasive. It is as , in the attempt to plumb Mannrsquos anxious, tormented psyche, he forgets to add the ingredients that allowed the author of works such as Buddenbrooks, The Magic Mountain and Doctor Faustus to claim a world stage.Where the novel sings, however, is in conveying the power of music. Here, Toibin steps out of his biographical straitjacket and touches on something convincingly inspirational. When, for instance, Mann listens to a quartet in which his son Michael is playing, he is fired with admiration: ldquoThomas wished he had been able to do this as a writer, find a tone or a context that was beyond himself, that was rooted in what shone and glittered and could be seen, but that hovered above the world of fact, entering into a place where spirit and substance could merge and drt apart and merge again.By the novelrsquos end, one ought to feel drained. It has encompassed high drama and heartbreak ndash the suicides of two of Mannrsquos sisters and one of his children, and countless deaths ndash enacted to a backdrop of genocidal annihilation, in which he and his family are nearly consumed. Yet despite passages where it briefly ignites, its tone is cool and dutul, too closely bound to a litany of events to be fully absorbing. As a result, The Magician is more like a work of accounting than creative illusion."},{"url":null,"title":"makar-kathleen-jamie-invites-scots-help-create-collaborative-nature-poem-scottish-book-news","story":"The combined work is pegged to the forthcoming COP summit in Glasgow, when she says, ldquothe worldrsquos attention will be on Scotland and the global response to Climate Change.Jamie adds: ldquoThe collective poem will be composed of single lines submitted by anyone who lives in Scotland and who loves our planet.

It also provides guidance for mums and dads on testing, self-isolation, and vaccination.Read the letter in full, below. Dear parents and carers,With schools having been back for nearly four weeks, I want to commend the care, commitment and courage shown by everyone in playing their part in keeping our communities safe. The number of cases of COVID- across Orkney have been rising of late and have affected a small proportion of adults and young people who attend at some of our schools.On Monday this week, there were  positive cases linked to Stromness Academy and we now also see six positive cases at Kirkwall Grammar School.We have worked closely with Public Health colleagues in Orkney and, together, we have managed local clusters very effectively. This was only successful thanks to the diligence of parents, pupils and staff in following the mitigations in place and for managing these situations positively but cautiously.Whilst so much has changed over the past  months, the fundamentals within our schools have remained the same. Children and young people still come to school to learn, play and socialise with their friends.The easing of restrictions has left some relieved and others anxious. I want to reassure you all that staff are doing everything they can to make your child’s experience a positive one, in particular by implementing Scottish Government guidance to keep us all as safe as possible.I do understand that there will be a level of nervousness among some of you with regard to the recent transmission rates, on this basis, the Education team felt it may be helpful to share the following information with you: Mitigating measures include:• Distancing between adults and between pupils when required.A detailed list of the mitigations is published below.There has also been some confusion around testing and the dference between PCR and LFD tests. Only request a PCR test :• You are contacted by Test  ProtectLateral Flow Device Tests:• Please ensure that you log the results of your Lateral Flow Devicetest onlineyou test positive or negative, this helps give an indication of whether or not the virus is spreading. Parents who are concerned their children might have contracted Covid can complete a self-help guide on NHS Inform that will help them determinethis is the case.If you develop symptoms or you have a positive LFD test, then you must request a PCR test through the COVID Assessment Centre . To request a vaccination call:   . The COVID Assessment Centre opens at .am and closes at pm . After a positive LFD you must isolate until your PCR test confirms you are negative. If your PCR is positive there will be isolation protocols that you will have to follow the NHS Orkney team will help folk every step of the way.Unless exempt, current mitigations are:•Hygiene, Ventilation and Face Coverings • All hand and respiratory hygiene mitigations will continue to be encouraged, and an enhanced cleaning regime will continue to apply in buildings and vehicles.• Windows should continue to be opened regularly to maximise ventilation.• Face coverings will continue to be a requirement at all times for all staff and learners in secondary schools.• In primary school, all other establishments, adults will be expected to wear a face covering whenever they cannot maintain physical distance from other adults, children or young people.• In nurseries, adults will be expected to wear a face covering whenever they cannot maintain physical distance from other adults, including parents.• In primary schools, adults will also need to wear a face covering whenever they are moving around communal areas of the school, including corridors.• Only pupils aged  and over will be required to wear a face covering when travelling on dedicated school transport. Groupings and Distancing• The grouping of pupils and adults into discrete bubbles will no longer be required, but assemblies and other large gatherings will continue to be kept on hold for the time being.• There will be no requirement for children and young people to maintain physical distancing between each other, although this will continue to be encouraged in secondary schools.• The distance that adults are required to maintain from other adults, children and young people has formally been reduced to one metre, however schools will continue to encourage pupils and staff to maintain two metre distancing wherever possible. Nursery children are not required to keep a distance from adults or children in the setting.• Pupils using dedicated school transport will not be expected to maintain distancing between each other, but there will remain an expectation that drivers remain at least one metre distance from all passengers.• Parents and carers will continue to be discouraged from attending school premises except in cases where this is agreed with the school as being absolutely necessary. Vaccination, Testing and Self-Isolation• Adults and secondary pupils will be encouraged to take twice-weekly LFD tests and to record their results online.• Any adult, child or young person who develops the symptoms of COVID-, or who test positive must self-isolate immediately in line with NHS Guidance, and noty their school.• Anyone who is fully vaccinated identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant.• Any young person aged between  years and  years four months, who is not yet fully vaccinated and who is identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant.• Any adult aged over  years four months, who is not fully vaccinated and who is identied by Test and Protect as a close contact of a positive case should self-isolate immediately and seek a PCR test.  They should continue to self-isolate for ten days from onset of symptoms eventhe test result is negative. • Children and young people aged from five to  will no longer be subject to a blanket requirement to self-isolate for ten daysthey are identied as a close contact by Test and Protect. Instead, they should self-isolate immediately and book a PCR Test. If the test result is negative and they remain without symptoms then they mayto school, whilst remaining vigilant. Children aged under  will be exempt from this testing.• Schools and Early Learning Childcare settings will not be required to stand down classes in the event of a positive case being identied.  They will, instead, send parents and staff a #warn and inform# letter advising them of the facts and reminding them that there is no need to self-isolate unless contacted by Test and Protect and advised otherwise.• The Chief Medical Officer advises that children and young people on the highest risk list can now follow that same advice as the rest of the population.

On st April , Lachie was appointed as the first member of staff and director and went on to become the chief executive officer.: #At that time, the association had built four houses for affordable rent in Glendale. It now has a housing portfolio of  affordable rent and  shared equity properties.#In addition to the affordable housing stock, Lachie has expanded the association’s range of services beyond our tenants to the wider community by taking over the responsibility of the care and repair service from Shelter and establishing the handyperson service — the first in Scotland # to assist our elderly folk in Lochalsh and Skye remain at home for as long as is reasonably possible.#He also established our innovative energy advice service for the wider community to reduce household fuel costs.#He added: ”Through Lachie’s leadership, the association has grown from one to  members of staff who all have the highest regard and respect for this man.“I have never heard a bad word said about Lachie, either from the staff, the board or within the community in which he serves.#While unaware of Mr McIvor#s praise, Lachie was quick to commend his colleagues for their important contributions to those achievements.#We have a fantastic staff team # we really are blessed. None of this is down to me, it is down to working as a team.“In that I include the board which over the years has been absolutely fantastic in supporting ideas.#If the board didn#t think that taking on a handy person project or setting up care and repair, or energy advice service was good, these things wouldn#t have happened — they have been very open about the role that the association could play as a community anchor.”He added: #Some of the things that we do I think are fantastic and have been copied where in Scotland # because the notion that we would have handyperson employees installing telecom devices in people#s homes throughout the whole of the Highlands just wouldn#t have been thought of.#I have been really lucky with the quality and flexibility of the people I have worked with # both the board and the staff members.#Commenting on his successor, he went on to say: #Neil Clapperton was until recently the chief executive of Grampian Housing Association through in Aberdeen # so it is a relief to be able to hand over to an experienced person rather than someone from another discipline to be trained up by the existing staff and board.#I think with the senior management now led by Neil and with keeping the same people such as Iain McIvor as director of investment, and our new director of finance services, Graeme Coull, and of course Angus MacLennan as our technical manager — that#s a really powerful team to take the organisation forward.#I#ll miss the people, they are absolutely splendid.#Reflecting on his time, Lachie said: #The housing system in the Highlands and Islands has never been in a better position.“My ambition was to wipe out homelessness in Skye and Lochalsh before I retired, and while I have not quite achieved that we have made huge strides towards dealing with that dficult issue.#I am quite optimistic that I am leaving the sector in a good position and ready to meet the challenges that they have ahead.#Looking ahead to retired le, Lachie said:#My three children and my grandchildren are all resident in and around Glasgow, they are all busy people but I want to spend signicantly more time with them, and also my family from Uist # I have sisters and lots of relatives over there so I#ll have a lot more time to visit them.“And I want to carry on my work as a board member with Am Fasgadh .#The only bit of advice I#ve had about retirement that someone said to me was #When you retire do nothing, and then do something’. I will take a rest and recharge my batteries but then I will have a look at what the future holds.”Mr McIvor added: #On a personal note, I am proud to have known Lachie for over  years as my director and then chief executive officer.#He is also a true friend, as are his family, and through his guidance, support and good humour, I am a better person for knowing Lachie MacDonald.#I have no doubt in my mind that this could be said by anyone who has met this remarkable and modest man.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Flora-Mac-Innes-with-husband-Norman-and-other-family-members.jpg","title":"hebridean history families reunited by the sound of a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineIn one astonishing example, that happened just after the launch of Tobar an Dualchais, a man whose father had died in the Second World War before he was born was able to hear his father’s voice for the first time.For most of us, we can only imagine what that must have been like: strangely recognisable phrases and subtle mannerisms or turns of phrase, along with deeper thoughts of how things might have been dferent…Whatever the case, we can be sure that for those who are able to reconnect or gain greater insight through the recordings of friends and family members long after they have passed is truly extraordinary and deeply personal.My mother, IsabelMacKenzie, had one of these experiences when she attended an event hosted by TAD in Lochboisdale in ..She of course immediately recognised her voice, although it had been some  years since her mother’s death.I never got to meet my grandmother. She died on Good Friday in  in the Sacred Heart Hospital in Daliburgh, South Uist. I was born six months later in the same hospital.I’ve always felt a special connection to her because I was named after her, although this almost didn’t happen.My motherthought she would name me ‘Fiona’. However, when our doctor, the highly regarded Dr Alasdair MacLean , asked what I was to be called and was told, he replied abruptly and conclusively declared that I was instead to be named after my grandmother. And that was that!It is a joy for me to be able to listen to my grandmother’s recordings. Her singing voice is quite similar to my mother’s, and through listening, I get a sense of the person she was..!Flòraidh was certainly hardy, like many women in those days.She gave birth to  children and my mother was the youngest of the ten that survived. She described her eleventh child as “gille mòr snog” . He was stillborn, and very little mention was made of him after his birth. until he was carried out by my grandfather who, with the other children in the family, took him to the cemetery in Baile, Eriskay.Already grateful for the opportunity to hear these recordings of my grandmother, I was truly amazed when I found recordings of her mother – my great grandmother, Mary Johnston.Although attempts had been made by family members over the years to locate these recordings of her, no one had succeeded until I happened upon them quite by accident.She was recorded in , shortly before she died, by Father Angus John MacQueen who was collaborating with John Lorne Campbell at the time and helping to build what now constitutes the ‘Canna Collection’.Mary Johnstonor ‘a Nì’ as she was known to her family, was born in Barra in  and was the daughter of Michael MacNeil of Castlebay and Anne Steele of Boisdale, South Uist.At the age of around four her mother passed away and she was taken to Uist to live with her auntie, whilst her father worked at sea..She tells how after her grandfather’s death her father was given an ultimatum:home to the family croft on Bernerayor it would be handed over to someone .Michael ed, promptly re-married, and Nì was sent back to live with him and her new stepmother..What isn’t mentioned in the recordings is that she was sent to the recently founded Orphanage for Roman Catholic Children in Bute where she trained as a cook.On herto Barra she met Ronald Johnston from Eriskay who was working in a shop in Castlebay and soon after they eloped to Glasgow. The fact that they were of a similar age to one another was considered undesirable at the time more conventionally, women tended to marry men a fair bit older than them.They had eight children together four girls and four boys – two of whom were killed in the Great War.The German aristocrat and photographer Werner Kissling took two marvellous photos of Nì during his famous filming trip to Eriskay in . The photos somehow manage to at once capture conflicting expressions of happiness, sadness, restlessness and contentment. A neat and handsome lady, she nevertheless seems considerably older than the  years she had already lived when Kissling visited.She is remembered as a kind woman who spoke often of le in Barra and the Barra Head islands, though she never set foot on any of them again after her marriage.It means a lot to me that I can listen to recordings of these two women on Tobar an Dualchais.

MacRae raced onto Jordan Fraser#s lofted pass and as MacDonald advanced the Shiel attacker kept a cool head to deftly clip the ball home and make it -.The goal knocked the stuffing out of Lovat, who struggled to create much in the way of clear chances thereafter. And deep into injury-time MacRae completed the fairy tale with another adroit finish for the hat-trick.There were no shortage of contenders for the Albert Smith medal for man of the match # but the award, now in its th year, went to defensive lynchpin Conor Cormack.After the match the -year-old hat-trick-hero, who previously feared he might have to quit the game after a succession of knee injuries, said: #It#s not really sunk it yet # at the final whistle we had people running to us and crying. It will take a while and maybe it will be a few days before it all hits home.#It#s something we all hoped hadn#t passed us by # you need a good run of games, and fortunately it has worked out for us this year. It#s an amazing feeling.#Kinlochshiel manager Johnston Gill, who has now led the club to the Premier League, MacAulay Cup and Camanachd Cup, added: #Lovat gave us a hard time of it, but we had Keith MacRae on fire today # the whole team were brilliant. #It was nip and tuck after they came back to - but I think we shaded the game as a whole.#We knew the threat they carried, but Fraser Heath was well marked by Finlay MacRae and Conor did a great job against Greg Matheson. #We got our tactics right and used our subs well # they were all outstanding.#It#s a fantastic day # most of the community is here with us in Oban # they are great for us, and give us fantastic backing. We will all enjoy it!#Meanwhile, earlier in the day Skye Camanachd also had a victory to savour as their under- team lted the Ken MacMaster Cup.Goals from Seonaidh MacLeod and Alasdair Stewart sealed a - win over Fort William."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4097188.jpg--.jpg?1632220580000\n","title":"ni businesses showcase their produce and services at london exhibition","story":"DOZENS of Northern Ireland businesses have showcased their products and services at an exhibition in London.The Westminster event is part of the Northern Ireland Offices centenary programme.Business leaders also attended a reception at Downing Street last Wednesday hosted by the prime minister.The government said it would provide businesses with an opportunity to network with international companies and investors.The exhibitors represented a cross-section of sectors within the Northern Ireland economy and included  start-ups.

Furthermore, the estimated number of movies that began shooting declined by % to .The downturn had a knock-on effect on global revenue, which fell by % in  compared to the previous year.Yet, at such precarious times for the industry, the Ballymena actor is still pumping out big box office draws and topping Netflix’s movie charts.Over the past  months, the -year-old Taken star, who has rebranded himself as a not-to-be-messed-with action figure in his middle age, opened two films at number one.The Marksman, in which he plays an Arizona rancher who becomes the unlikely defender of a Mexican boy pursued by cartel assassins, knocked Wonder Woman  from the top spot on its release earlier this year. Daily Headlines Newsletter  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      A few months earlier, Honest Thief held the top spot at the box office for two weeks back-to-back, grossing .m from , cinemas on its first day. While revenue was down due to the pandemic, the film’s performance proved cinemagoers hadn’t given up on big screens.Not content with being the only actor to lend his name to two number-one box office hits since the pandemic kicked off, Neeson’s thriller The Ice Road was the most-watched movie on Netflix  hours after premiering at the start of the summer. An older movie, Unknown, originally released a decade ago, drew strong viewing figures on Netflix back in January this year, again ranking at number one.It doesn’t stop there. February sees the US release of another Neeson-fronted thriller, Blacklight, directed by Mark Williams. It sees him play a fixer for the FBI who is tasked with pulling undercover agents out of dangerous situations. He finds himself in the middle of a conspiracy when one such agent questions the people he is working for.The father-of-two is currently filming Retribution, a Speed-like thriller about a bank executive whose le is thrown upside down when a bomb is placed inside his car with him and his family. A few other thriller-type films are in the pipeline, currently at the pre-production stage.So what drives Neeson to be so prolic and why does his appeal endure  Film critic and lecturer Mike Catto said there were a number of reasons why directors and film fans alike are so Taken with the Northern Irish man.“From people who have worked with him, I’ve been told he is extremely hard-working, just gets on with it and there are never any tantrums He has a strong work ethic and still feels the impetus to work. If the work is there, he will take it,” he added.“Neeson is still in good health and shape, andwe look at Hollywood’s history, actors like James Stewart and Henry Fonda were still working into their s.“There are two strong reasons why his appeal is so enduring: firstly, his reliability. His movie A Walk Among the Tombstones wasn’t his greatest but still attracted an audience.“Secondly, his voice. It’s easily recognisable, in the same way Sean Connery had a distinctive voice. Put Neeson’s name above the title and people will come because they like that voice.”Catto said changes in the technology behind movie-making also meant that high-quality feature films could be made faster, using high-definition video and electronic editing. He said the advent of streaming services had prompted a demand for middle budget films that didn’t require massive sets or fancy special effects, and that many of Neeson’s movies fell into this category.“There are other actors who have many projects on the go at the one time, like Matt Damon or Kenneth Branagh,” added Catto.“Neeson certainly has a good few years left in him yet. I can’t see him leaping off roofs in  years, but as the movie Ordinary Love with Lesley Manville proved, he can be versatile.“If he feels physically and mentally capable of doing the roles, I think he’ll just keep doing them for as long as he can.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsLiam NeesonMost ReadSam McBrideOpinionA good man died after too much Covid misinformation – while his hero, lockdown sceptic Ivor Cummins, goes on making money from devoteesMan released from Donegal hospital by anti-vaccination campaigners against medical advice has died in hospitalMy le fell apart so fast... it can happen to anyoneDUP leader Donaldson calls for electoral pact among unionist parties to stop Sinn FeinRory McIlroy: Padraig Harrington slammed for ‘panic button’ decision to drop Ryder Cup star on Saturday morningTop VideosPlay Warning Graphic Content: Scene of Dundonald shootingPlayHillary Clinton says Northern Ireland is a symbol of peace and hopePlayVet who voiced food safety concerns in line for £m payout from StormontLatest Northern IrelandPolice officer injured during vehicle pursuitMan grabbed and shot in legUUP leader rejects call for unionist pactProtests take place across Ireland against UK Government legacy proposalsGreen Party councillor calls for Lisburn to go car free for a dayLatestHarry and Meghan call for vaccine equity in New York speechLiam BeckettOpinionIs a small statue in a car park really the best we can do to honour a national treasure Gareth McAuleyOpinionThe women’s game is now taking the lead in Northern Ireland footballJulian TaylorOpinionCeltic captain Callum McGregor can be an inspiration to all at ParkheadMichael SadlierOpinionSupport act plays their part again at Ulster’s Kingspan Stadium,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is fitting that today we are all together honouring a group of women who reached across those long-held isions to help make peace real, the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition.Women like Bronagh Hinds, Professor Monica McWilliams, Jane Morrice, Pearl Sagar OBE. They formed their own political party in  in order to participate in the formal peace negotiations. Women did not have a seat at the table. A quarter century of bloodshed and stre and embedded sexism had discouraged most women from politics, but they were relentless in their commitment to peace. They had a great slogan too, ‘Wave Goodbye to the Dinosaurs’.“Throughout my career as First Lady, US Senator, Secretary of State, some of my most cherished memories are moments spent with the remarkable women of Northern Ireland, all waving away those dinosaurs.“Women like the late Pat Hume, a gracious, determined force behind the peace deal.“Women wanted the same things,” said Secretary Clinton.“Good jobs, good schools for their children, streets you could walk down safely, a future you could believe in.“But even here in Northern Ireland, the peace and progress so many worked tirelessly to achieve is incomplete.“The work of integration in housing and schools is far from finished.“Neighbourhoods remain ided. Poverty and unemployment persist. The dficulties of the past continue to threaten the present.“Divisions over Brexit and the Northern Ireland Protocol and proposed amnesty legislation might very well undermine a peaceful future.“A future that people voted for, fought for, and even died for.”Mrs Clinton said it remains for the people of Northern Ireland to shape the future.“I don’t pretend to have the political answers to resolve this impasse. That is up to the people of Northern Ireland,” she said.“But I do know this, the future of Northern Ireland will be determined by the power of communities coming together, like the one here at Queen’s.“Many of the students here today were born after the Good Friday Agreement was signed. They study together, play sports and join clubs together. They have long, deep conversations late into the night. These may be simple interactions but when considered in the context of Northern Ireland’s history, the idea of young Protestants and Catholics, unionists and nationalists, loyalists and republicans being one another’s friends, classmates and mentors shows it’s clear these relationships are transformative.”Mrs Clinton said the Good Friday Agreement remains a testament to the courage and faith of the people of Northern Ireland.“But we cannot take it for granted,” she warned.“Seamus Heaney said that sometimes people leave aside their cynicism, their bitterness, their hatreds, and hope and history rhyme. That is the choice the people of Northern Ireland made in .“I sincerely hope it is the choice you and countless others around the world will continue to make.“Peace is a process, not an event. Seamus Heaney also told us to believe a further shore us reachable from here.“The work here at Queen’s is far from finished but we can see that further shore,” she said.“Let us reach towards it together and prove to the world once again that we still live in a time when hope and history rhyme.”Mrs Clinton was appointed to the role for a five-year term in early  but her official installation was delayed due to the Covid- pandemic.As Mrs Clinton took part in the installation procession, a number of anti-war protesters, who had gathered outside, hurled insults and abuse.The ceremony also saw honorary degrees awarded to  leading figures in the worlds of business, politics, sport, the arts, policing and education in Northern Ireland.Among recipients were Derry Girls writer and creator Lisa McGee, former Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable Sir George Hamilton and Ireland’s highest-capped female athlete, international hockey player Shirley McCay..app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsQueen’s UniversityMore On Queen’s University PremiumDr Gail McConnell pens poetry book about coming to terms with father’s Troubles death PremiumRelentless cyber attacks on NI Civil Service uncoveredPopular writer Stewart Love who penned one of the first Troubles-related plays dies at Coronavirus NI: Students getting vaccinated will help ease disruption to their lives, says health minister as ‘jabbathon’ continuesTrial from Queen’s University leads to improved and money-saving way to treat eye diseaseMost ReadSam McBrideOpinionA good man died after too much Covid misinformation – while his hero, lockdown sceptic Ivor Cummins, goes on making money from devoteesMan released from Donegal hospital by anti-vaccination campaigners against medical advice has died in hospitalMy le fell apart so fast... it can happen to anyoneDUP leader Donaldson calls for electoral pact among unionist parties to stop Sinn FeinRory McIlroy: Padraig Harrington slammed for ‘panic button’ decision to drop Ryder Cup star on Saturday morningTop VideosPlay Warning Graphic Content: Scene of Dundonald shootingPlayHillary Clinton says Northern Ireland is a symbol of peace and hopePlayVet who voiced food safety concerns in line for £m payout from StormontLatest Northern IrelandPolice officer injured during vehicle pursuitMan grabbed and shot in legUUP leader rejects call for unionist pactProtests take place across Ireland against UK Government legacy proposalsGreen Party councillor calls for Lisburn to go car free for a dayLatestLiam BeckettOpinionIs a small statue in a car park really the best we can do to honour a national treasure Gareth McAuleyOpinionThe women’s game is now taking the lead in Northern Ireland footballJulian TaylorOpinionCeltic captain Callum McGregor can be an inspiration to all at ParkheadMichael SadlierOpinionSupport act plays their part again at Ulster’s Kingspan StadiumRyder Cup day two: US open up imposing lead on Saturday,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Of those , cases, , were accepted as homeless.At constituency level Ms Eastwood, a Lisburn and Castlereagh representative, is dealing with a “crazy” amount of housing issues.“Throughout the pandemic the problems have been exacerbated,” she said.She said misconceptions still exist of homeless people on a street corner, wrapped in a sleeping bag with a can of beer in their hand. In reality, many have mental health issues and are self-medicating to cope.

Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      As a survivor of domestic abuse and someone who left the family home before she turned , she can relate to those experiences.She said that often young people are left to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of family trauma. While she achieved top grades and went to law school, she “hated it” and couldn’t process the trauma she had witnessed in earlier years.As a -year-old she wasn’t prepared for the lack of structure at university and ended up leaving the family home.After moving into student accommodation with a cousin, she quit a part-time job, split up with her long-term boyfriend, dropped out of university and didn’t take care of herself.Ms Eastwood had no money to pay rent or buy food and was reliant on others in the student house for hand-outs.Things spiralled further when she found herself in an “extremely unhealthy relationship” with an older man” which was “abusive, toxic and much more than that — I would now see him as a predator”.She added: “On the face of it I was probably regarded as an academically ‘smart’ student who had a lovely family, but I had no support to face the unresolved trauma I had experienced and lived with.“As a result, my le fell apart fast and I just ended up in really unsafe situations. Through lived experience I know it can happen to anyone.”She feels that services need to improve by taking a holistic approach to limit the number of people falling through the cracks.Placing homeless people —who often have a mental health issue and are seeking treatment for drug addiction — in hostels with other addicts where they get trapped in a “vicious cycle” should not happen, Ms Eastwood added.She said there needs to be a “dual diagnosis process” whereby people are offered detox and mental health treatment together.“We need more social housing. Councils, the Housing Executive, health trusts, the police and others need to come together to improve services.“We need early intervention at the same time someone makes an application.”.app-box.app-box h.app-box a.app-box img Download the BelfastAppGet quick and easy access to the latest Northern Ireland news, sport, business and opinion with the BelfastApp.Related topicsLisburn and Castlereagh City CouncilAlliance PartyMore On Lisburn and Castlereagh City CouncilBalmoral Show : A quieter affair, but visitors delighted to be back PremiumBalmoral Show preview: There is something for everyone as agri-food event sRotten shellfish dumped in Belfast for third time in a month… councillor calls for investigation PremiumNI firm behind Harrods and Wembley revamps upbeat after ‘tough  months’Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council drops £k DNA plan to snf out dog foulersMost ReadSam McBrideOpinionA good man died after too much Covid misinformation – while his hero, lockdown sceptic Ivor Cummins, goes on making money from devoteesMan released from Donegal hospital by anti-vaccination campaigners against medical advice has died in hospitalMy le fell apart so fast... it can happen to anyoneDUP leader Donaldson calls for electoral pact among unionist parties to stop Sinn FeinRory McIlroy: Padraig Harrington slammed for ‘panic button’ decision to drop Ryder Cup star on Saturday morningTop VideosPlay Warning Graphic Content: Scene of Dundonald shootingPlayHillary Clinton says Northern Ireland is a symbol of peace and hopePlayVet who voiced food safety concerns in line for £m payout from StormontLatest Northern IrelandPolice officer injured during vehicle pursuitMan grabbed and shot in legUUP leader rejects call for unionist pactProtests take place across Ireland against UK Government legacy proposalsGreen Party councillor calls for Lisburn to go car free for a dayLatestHarry and Meghan call for vaccine equity in New York speechLiam BeckettOpinionIs a small statue in a car park really the best we can do to honour a national treasure Gareth McAuleyOpinionThe women’s game is now taking the lead in Northern Ireland footballJulian TaylorOpinionCeltic captain Callum McGregor can be an inspiration to all at ParkheadMichael SadlierOpinionSupport act plays their part again at Ulster’s Kingspan Stadium,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandBelfast BeatUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendNewsEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Kevin Scott Belfast John BreslinSeptember   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailMillionaire broadcaster Stephen Nolan believes he is not a success in le because of a failure to manage his weight — and not having any children.In a candid interview, the television and radio presenter said he hated when people suggest he is a success because of his millionaire status.“I hate people suggesting I’m successful because I’m not,” the -year-old told the Sunday Times.“Being a millionaire is not a success to me. The two things I would consider successful would be to have a normal weight and children. I don’t have either.”As he ages, Nolan revealed he is more and more worried about his health. Several years ago, the presenter managed to reduce his weight from  stone to , but has since put most of it back on.“I’m a complete failure with my health. Weight has defeated me and continues to defeat me,” he said.“No matter how hard I drive myself in other things, I’m a total and absolute failure with my weight. It gets me down, it worries me. Now I’m getting older, it worries me even more. I can’t beat it. I cannot do it.” Daily Headlines Newsletter  EveningNewsletter Receive todays headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.  Enter email address   This field is required  Sign Up      The presenter, who fronts The Nolan Show on BBC Radio Ulster, Stephen Nolan on BBC Radio  Live and Nolan Live, which s to BBC on Wednesday, defended his more than £, salary, among the broadcaster’s highest. “I like earning money. I don’t think people in London should just be on the BBC’s Top Ten earning list. You should be able to sit in Northern Ireland, or in any of the nations, and punch in big figures,” he said.He also revealed libel suits have been filed against two more iniduals he claims abused him online.Nolan, recently awarded large sums totalling more than £, after successful actions against two other internet “trolls”, vowed he will spend money going after people he believes are trying to destroy him.A writ has been issued in the High Court in Belfast against a Northern Ireland-based businesswoman, while the second claim will be in the High Court in Dublin against an estate agent based in the Republic of Ireland, Paul Tweed, his solicitor, told the Sunday Times.Mr Tweed also represented former First Minister Arlene Foster, who was awarded £, damages over a tweet by Christian Jessen, the presenter of Channel ’s Embarrassing Bodies“I don’t want to hurt people. I don’t want to be this rich guy going after people, but I’m as vulnerable as anyone ,” he said. “Rather than buy a new car I will spend my money going after somebody who has set out to destroy me.”He added: “I get a lot of abuse about my presentation style. That’s acceptable. I get a lot of abuse about my weight. I talk about it, so there we go.“But when someone threatens to put a bullet in your head ... I let that go for a while, then I thought, ‘No’. When there are people setting out to destroy me, and that is their sole aim ... In the past I would have turned a blind eye to that. I’m proactively going after them now.”His vow comes ahead of the second reading of a bill to update the law to bring it more into line with England, where reforms were introduced in  amid concerns London had become a libel destination for plaintfs from ious parts of the world. Nolan also made a revealing comment about the regularity of crises happening here.“For those of us who live in Northern Ireland it seems as though we’re always at a critical juncture.

Dr McCloskey also featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been “coerced, bribed or bullied” into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were “malevolent”. The GMC said: “The tribunal directed an -month interim suspension but all such restrictions are kept under regular review while a full investigation is carried out. “Doctors are unable to practice medicine in the UK while interim suspended. “These tribunals do not determine the facts of what happened, but undertake a risk assessment of whether temporary protection is needed.” The GMC investigated former Aontuacute councillor Dr McCloskey following a complaint made by Foyle MLA Sinead McLaughlin of the SDLP. She said: “I requested the General Medical Council to consider two social media videos posted by a Derry GP. It is essential that medical professionals provide patients and the general public with the best possible advice with regard to vaccinations. There is overwhelming evidence that vaccinations provide protection against the worst effects of Covid.     “I am extremely concerned that anti-vaccination and Covid denying propaganda is discouraging some of our population from being vaccinated. That is extremely damaging to the health of our population. “Derry continues to have a very high rate of Covid infection and the North of Ireland as a whole continues to suffer from a comparatively low vaccination rate. The medical profession obviously has a key role in tackling these issues.”   ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry NewsDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsAltnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Peter Bough, Buying Director with Aldi Ireland and Peter Mulrine, Managing Director of MulrinesBusinessDonegal company awarded new €.m contract to supply supermarket giant in Ireland and UK overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnThe Graham Norton Show is back!

Do not speak for me and my brother. Do not speak for Stephen and you surely do not speak for the people of Derry.” The proposed government amnesty would prevent prosecutions for conflict-related offences and close down present and future police and Police Ombudsman investigations, civil actions and legacy inquests. Other rallies were organised in protest of the amnesty today both North and South of the border. See Mondays paper for full coverage.

This he says will help the healing process and move us further along the road to reconciliation. “Well, I have a clear message for you, Mr Lewis and Mr Johnson, how dare you try and speak for me and try and tell me what is best for our family. Do not speak for me and my brother. Do not speak for Stephen and you surely do not speak for the people of Derry.” The proposed government amnesty would prevent prosecutions for conflict-related offences and close down present and future police and Police Ombudsman investigations, civil actions and legacy inquests. Other rallies were organised in protest of the amnesty today both North and South of the border. See Mondays paper for full coverage.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny.     The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry NewsDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsAltnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Peter Bough, Buying Director with Aldi Ireland and Peter Mulrine, Managing Director of MulrinesBusinessDonegal company awarded new €.m contract to supply supermarket giant in Ireland and UK overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnThe Graham Norton Show is back!

Going away to university or college is likely the first time many students are fending for themselves. They’ll be paying for books, meals, bills, rent and socialising on their own for the first time. googletag.cmd.push Eoin Clarke, Managing Director ofSwitcher.iehas put together these tips to help students manage their money. Banking -Choosing a student bank account can be tricky, especially as banks try to lure you in with exciting free perks. But don’t be fooled by flashy freebies think about what is important to you before choosing. Check which bank provides things like an overdraft, mobile app, internet banking or mobile payments, decide which features are most important to you and then make an informed decision. You may also be able to get astudent credit cardwhich could help you manage unplanned expenses, however only get oneyou are sure you are able to pay off your balance in full each month. Providers -When deciding who to go with for things like broadband don’t just go for the cheapest option. If you’re living in a property with other people you need a download limit that will stand up to the usage of everyone using it at the same time. Many broadband contracts are - months, compare to seeamonthly rolling contractcould be cheaper over the year so you won’t have to pay exit fees. Get the right cover-Make sure your belongings are protected at third level, shop around for good content andgadget cover. Mobile phones and laptops can be expensive to replace, covering them against loss, theft or damage could save you hundreds of eurosanything were to happen to them.      Budgeting -Creating a budget when heading off to college or university is key to make sure you have enough money left to make it to the end of term. Start by writing down all your incomings and outgoings, include things like nights out, bills, clothes, food, transport and any money you will earn or have saved. If something doesnt fit into your budget seethere is anything you can save on. Having a budget will help you work out what you can spend each month and ensure you don’t get into unmanageable debt. Be Savvy -Many retailers offer cashback or student discounts either through schemes like Unidays or just by showing proof you’re studying. Be sure to check whenever buying something - every little bit helps and you may be surprised how much you could save. Shop around -Before rushing out and buying every book on the reading list, have a look online to seeyou could buy them cheaper second hand.

Counties are currently instructed to provide team sheets to the relevant organising body for match programme purposes no later than am on the Thursday before a weekend fixture. However, several counties communicate their line-ups with the proviso that they are not to be issued to the public until they themselves publish them. When they do, a number don’t include their  substitutes. googletag.cmd.push The GAA are to release the team and substitute lists more than  hours before the first matches as a means of promoting the games as well as cutting out the possibility of leaks. It is envisaged the move might prompt counties to announce their line-ups before Friday. The Thursday morning registration, which prevents counties from making th-hour changes to their squad unless in an emergency, was voted in at Congress in Paacuteraic Duffy’s time as director-general as a way of combatting dummy teams. Penalties for not providing the -man list included the withdrawal of sideline privileges for the manager for one match and a fine of up to €, for the county board. Forfeiture is the punishment for fielding a player who has not been registered on the list provided to the referee. The lack of consideration in the rules for late injuries and sickness has been regularly condemned by managers and there have been some instances where less than  players have been available as the deadline for personnel changes had passed and injured men have togged out with no intention of being used.     Match regulations state for non senior inter-county championship games the teams are to be issued to the committee in charge for the official programme and media four days before the game although it is rarely respected, while for league games, the home county must receive team selection from the visitors no later than Wednesday prior to the fixture. For Saturday games, several of the leading counties in both codes make their team disclosures the night previous.

Sinead said: “We reduced our out-goings, put on pause our marketing spend in the business. We just tried to protect the cash that we had. “The first impact was our customers that we sell to in Asia. They all went into lockdown so our orders and sales to them stopped. But also a lot of our production happens out in Asia so our factories went into lockdown. “Luckily we had bought a lot of stock beforehand. We were so relieved that we had, at least we could carry on trading with our UK and European customers.” With around half of the company’s sales in the UK and Ireland and half in the export business, Shnuggle had to rely on their local retail-base. Sinead continued: “Baby items were classed as essential goods which was a huge relief to us. This meant as long as we could socially distance within the warehouse we could continue trading and selling online. All of our business is supplying other retailers like John Lewis, Mamas and Papas, Amazon. But our online sales actually grew because everyone was at home and maybe an element of panic buying.”      CASH HELP: The Shnuggle team Shnuggle took advantage of the furlough and Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Schemeschemes. Sinead said: “We furloughed five out of our  team, and were able to access the Business Interruption loan through Ulster Bank. “We were relieved to get the money in quickly, so we weren’t worrying about paying wages or our biggest overhead was our suppliers in China who were calling in all of their debts. “That was our biggest headache and stress, we owed signicant amounts of money to them and we didn’t have the cash as we needed time to sell our products.” Shnuggle also received a pound, Small Business Grant. Adam said: “Furloughing was brilliant, and the CBILS was the one that was the best for us because it meant that we could keep all our suppliers happy. “So even though we had a temporary dip in our sales, and obviously the inventory was sitting there ready to sell, it just kept us solvent and the cash flow moving. It’s really going to help us trade out of it, andall goes well, we should be able to get back into a reasonably strong cash position within the next six to  months. The loans coming in helped us to sleep at night.” The Government schemes also gave Sinead and Adam the freedom to ersy into the PPE market and the development of HeroShield Ltd, enabling local firms to unite to develop a protective face covering for key workers. This non-profit company designs, produces and distributes reusable visors.   ‘It’s surprisingly easy and money arrives quickly’ CASE STUDY  Q-MASS An unprecedented package of UK Government financial support has helped firms like Q-Mass in East Kilbride weather the coronavirus crisis. Director Ronnie Robertson said lockdown hit his company’s order book, but the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has been vital to help them hang on to their valued staff. Ronnie said: “Before this, we had quite a good order book, with three to four months of work planned, so we were pretty worried where it was going to take us.” At first, he was worried how he would keep Q-Mass’  staff on the payroll, but then the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme was announced. It offers UK Government support to pay  per cent of staff’s wages up to pound, a month, and the scheme has now been extended until the end of October. Q-Mass manufactures bespoke parts for the oil, gas and defence industry so staff training is important. Ronnie said: “Our staff are very highly skilled. We’ve gathered a bunch of people here and trained them up and taken on apprentices. We do a lot of training, we’ve got good people, we train them a lot and we want to hang on to them.” He found applying for the furlough scheme quick and straightforward. He said: “It was surprisingly easy and we were surprised that the money came through relatively quickly.” Now staff at the firm who’ve been furloughed are gradually ing to work, with strict safety measures in place. Ronnie said: “We’ve put a day sht back on and we’ve still got a few office people working at home, with quite a few still on furlough.  ‘SURPRISINGLY EASY’: Q-Mass director Ronnie Robertson praises the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme “We’re just ticking over. We’re trying to cover our costs every month, trying to break even, to stay still. We’re looking at it thatwe can stay still we’re doing very well.” And because of the size of the building, maintaining a two-metre distance hasn’t been a problem for ing staff. Ronnie said: “It’s been really easy. We’ve got a big workshop with wide corridors and we’ve got a lot of the doors propped open internally so no-one has to touch doors or handles. We’ve got a few toilet areas with restrictions on them and a couple of one-way corridors, but the offices are open plan, so there’s no real need for people to be near each other. The workshop’s a big, wide-open space and we have to keep cleaning things like photocopiers and touch screens, but it’s been quite straightforward.” Now Ronnie’s looking forward to a brighter future. He said: “I feel like we’re on the side of the valley and we’re looking across to the other side and it looks absolutely fantastic.” Money for business and staff Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

Cllr Heaney, who represents the Foyleside ward, hailed the decision as “an important move” in helping motorists to transition from traditional fossil fuels – such as petrol and diesel – towards electric power. googletag.cmd.push The Parking Strategy for Derry City and Strabane District identied the need to review the current electric charging infrastructure and quanty the council’s future needs as one of its proposed strategic options. It is hoped that by changing the electric vehicle charging infrastructure in its off-street car-parks, the council is removing any potential barrier to visit and stay in the city Cllr Heaney said: “At the council meeting, we agreed to explore further the possibility of getting new and improved electric charging points for electric motor vehicles into all council car-parks throughout our city and district. “It is an important move as the council plays its part in tackling the climate crisis as we encourage and incentivise as many motorists as possible to move away from fossil-fuelled cars and into electric cars. We want to see this progressing soon. “I was delighted to support this proposal at the council’s Business and Culture committee. Recent figures have revealed that only . per cent of electric vehicles in the north are owned by residents of our council area. “The lack of modern and efficient electric vehicle charging points within our council boundaries is clearly a factor influencing this low figure.     “Council officers have now been tasked with scoping out how charging points can be installed in all council car parks which will massively increase the charging infrastructure, encourage the purchase of more electric vehicles and further decrease the carbon footprint within our city and district.” ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry NewsDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsAltnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Peter Bough, Buying Director with Aldi Ireland and Peter Mulrine, Managing Director of MulrinesBusinessDonegal company awarded new €.m contract to supply supermarket giant in Ireland and UK overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnThe Graham Norton Show is back!

Opel’s ground-breaking powertrain technology and architecture means that the low, flat battery gives the Vio-e a stable centre of gravity and maximum cabin space. Designed from the ground up with both diesel and electric powertrains in mind, the Vio-e is based heavily on the Opel Corsa-e and its driveline fits comfortably between the chassis rails of the new Vio-e.     Power comes from a kW motor producing Nm of torque for smooth, swt and linear acceleration. The kWh battery is made up of  modules consisting of  inidual cells, while the larger kWh battery has  cells split over  modules.Cooling for the batteries comes from the van’s own in-cab cooling system, which Opel says helps to increase their range and letime. All Vio-e models come with three driving modes and switchable regenerative braking as standard.The standard on-board charger is a .kW single phase unit, while DC charging of up to kW is also supported.Trim and Body Options         Trim levels in the new Vio-e  van consist of Edition and Sportive models, both of which come with standard features such as driver and passenger airbags, electric parking brake, cruise control, full size spare wheel, .” colour dashboard display, remote central deadlocking, two side loading doors, electric front windows, electrically adjustable and heated door mirrors, -speaker audio with a USB inlet, Bluetooth, steering-column remote audio controls, and a DAB radio.Top-spec Sportive trim brings with it air-conditioning, ” colour touchscreen with smartphone projection, body coloured bumpers , LED daytime running lights, front fog lights, rear parking sensors, automatic lights and wipers, electrically folding door mirrors, acoustic windscreen and full-size wheel covers.Available with two body s and two roof heights, the Vio-e is just as flexible as a diesel van with a load volume of up to .m. Because the batteries are between the chassis rails, the total capacity of the load space is completely unchanged, allowing ,mm s in the L model and up to ,mm in the L when using the load-through bulkhead.Otherwise, the standard maximumcapacity of the van is ,mm for the L and ,mm for the L.Payloads are equally impressive, as replacing the engine and transmission with batteries and a motor doesn’t signicantly harm it’s capacities.All Vio-e vans have a gross vehicle weightof .-tonne, and depending on spec you can get a maximum ,kg payload out of a L standard roof height van with the kWh battery.Specying the larger kWh unit brings that figure down to ,kg.Those figures are just kg less than a diesel-engine Vio — a far cry from the disadvantage that battery electric vehicles used to have when compared to diesel-powered vans in the past.Test VanMy test van was a new Vio-e SportivekWh finished in stylish Moonstone Grey metallic paint. The three-seater Vio-e has storage under the passenger bench, while the driver’s seat comes with an adjustable armrest and -way seat adjustment. Being an electric van where the full amount of torque is available from just rpm all the way up to ,rpm, it is exceptionally quick off the mark.Unladen, the Vio-e accelerates with impressive urgency, and I have no doubt it would still prove fast even with a full payload on board.The top speed is limited to km h in order to preserve the battery range, but this is something that should not be of any concern to Vio-e drivers, as the van is more than capable of overtaking slower moving traffic with great ease.The regenerative braking system in the Vio-e is selected by pressing the ‘B mode’ button beside the gear selector, and this applies enough braking to activate the brake lights and slow the vehicle down before the driver presses the brake pedal.I loved the fact that the Vio-e is very car-like to drive, and the selectable Eco, Normal and Power driving modes ensure that there is a mode to suit every type of driver and every type of load. The Vio-e remains composed and comfortable when driven over rutted road surfaces, while body lean through bends is very well controlled.The Vio-e pulls away in silence, with just a hum from the on-board sound generator that is designed to warn others of your presence at low speeds, with just minimal levels of tyre and wind noise noticeable at higher speeds.Charging TimesCharging the Vio-efrom a domestic socket can take up to  hours, but this drops dramatically to . hours when charged from a .KW wall box charger .However, DC rapid charging from a kW sourcetakes just half an hour for the kWh battery and  minutes for the kWh version.Verdict  PricingOverall, the new Opel Vio-e is a genuinely impressive van to drive, easy to live with on a daily basis, offers fast-charging options and it is a good looking van too.In my opinion, this is the class-leading  van in the all-electric light commercial vehiclemarket right now, and deservedly so too.

The Formentor’s design inside and out is something quite dferent to what we have seen before, and brings with it a new dimension in style and sophistication. Being part of the Volkswagen Group means that Cupra has access to cutting-edge mechanicals and technology, and this has enabled the new Formentor compact SUV to hit the ground running, so to speak.  googletag.cmd.push   There is a lot of money and confidence behind the Cupra brand, and that is evident in the bold product plan promised by the company.Engine  Trim OptionsThe Formentor sits on the familiar MQB set of chassis components that also underpins other crossovers such as the Seat Ateca and VW Tiguan. Petrol engine options in the Formentor consist of a .-litre TSI with bhp and a .-litre TSI unit with a choice of ,  or bhp. The . TSI engine is available as a -speed manual or -speed DSG , while the . TSI comes with a DSG transmission as standard, with Cupra’s Drivesystem standard in bhp guise. A . TDIEVO engine is available with bhp and can be mated to a -speed manual or -speed DSG transmission, with the latter coming with Drive as standard.     Additionally, a .-litre e-Hybrid powertrain is available with a choice of bhp or bhp, both of which are mated to a -speed DSG transmission with promised fuel consumption as low as .l km on a combined WLTP driving cycle.There is a choice of two trim levels in CUPRA’s new compact SUV — Formentor and Formentor VZ — with the latter being the Cupra Formentor’s most powerful trim, named in reference to the Spanish word ‘Veloz’, meaning ‘fast’.The Formentor VZ trim offers high-performance powertrain options. Coming with ” alloy wheels, a ” Navigation system, autonomous assistance technology and performance bucket seats as standard.         Test CarMy test car was a Cupra Formentor . TSiDSGwhich was finished in stylish Graphene Grey Premium metallic paint with optional ” Exclusive Aero Black and Copper alloy wheels for an added dose of visual drama. Producing bhp and Nm of torque, the ,cc engine propels the Formentor from a standing start to km h in just .-seconds, on its way to a top speed of km h .Key standard features include full LED headlamps and Daytime Running Lights, rear ‘coast to coast’ light with welcome ceremony, front fog lamps with cornering , heat-insulated and tinted rear windows, leather-wrapped multi- heated sports steering wheel, dark aluminium glossy interior package, textile sport seats, keyless unlocking and ignition system, .” Digital Cockpit, ” Media System with DAB radio, Connect Online infotainment , rain and light sensor, heated front seats, adaptive cruise control, park assist, rear view camera, Drive Profile Selection, and auto high-beam assist, along with a suite of advanced safety systems.Optional extras fitted to my test car included premium metallic paint, black leather bucket seats, ” alloy wheels, hands-free electric tailgate, Dynamic Chassis Control, and Safe  Drive “L” . The sweet-revving petrol engine in my test car produces bhp and Nm of torque, enabling the car to sprint from -km h in .-seconds, with claimed fuel consumption as low as .-l km .As in other VW Group models, the .-litre engine is commendably quick to drop onto two cylinders to save fuel when cruising, and the process of cutting out and back in again is hard to detect. Composed and predictable handling is admirable, as is the Formentor’s ability to soak up road imperfections with ease.Impressive Sporty InteriorTake a seat behind the wheel of the CUPRA Formentor and you could be forgiven for thinking that you are in a hatchback rather than a compact SUV. The seating position is low, as is the base of the windscreen, so you feel like you sit much closer to the road — as you would in a performance-focused car.Selectable driving modes in the Formentor consist of Comfort, Sport, Cupra and Inidual, with each mode bringing a greater degree of aggression and engine noise that gets pumped through the cars speakers.Cabin space in the Formentor is excellent, with adults over six foot tall still able to sit comfortably in the rear seats. You could even sit three abreast thanks to the shallow transmission tunnel. The use of quality materials, with a grainy metal finish in the middle of the fascia, makes the cabin of the Formentor a pleasant and comfortable place to be, while bronze Cupra highlights on the air vents add a sense of occasion to every journey. The boot capacity of -litres in the Formentor . TSI can be expanded by dropping the rear seatbacks, allowing for even greater practicality when called upon.The Formentor scored a full five star rating in its Euro NCAP crash test, thanks in part to standard safety systems such as lane-keep assist, forward collision warning, predictive cruise control and driver alert warning.The new Cupra Formentor offers a more exclusive, contemporary vision of sportiness, which is instilled into an exquisitely sleek and bold design.

Mega Draw excitement is building ahead of Friday night’s extra special EuroMillions promotional event which has a guaranteed jackpot of € million. Since the EuroMillions game launched in Ireland in , there have been  Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners. If tomorrow night’s staggering € million jackpot is won in Ireland, we could see a new Irish winner added to the roll call of jackpot wins. googletag.cmd.push The National Lottery has advised players dreaming of winning big in the th September draw to continue to follow public health guidelines andplaying in retail, to buy their tickets early to avoid queues which will inevitably build in the hours leading up to the cut-off for ticket sales at .pm on Friday evening. Meanwhile, the Lotto jackpot roll continues and is now set to hit an estimated € million. The current Lotto jackpot has been rolling for over three months since Wednesday th June. So far this year, there have been five Lotto jackpot wins by players in Limerick, Kilkenny, Westmeath, Cork and Galway. In the history of the Lotto game in Ireland, only one jackpot in excess of € million has ever been won which was in June  when the Dan Morrissey syndicate from Carlow scooped a whooping €,,. A single winner of Saturday night’s le-changing € millionjackpot would find themselves at number two on the list of all-time highest wins since the game launched in Ireland in .     A National Lottery spokesperson said:“What a weekend we have ahead of us! We could potentially see two hugely le-altering amounts being won by National Lottery players in Ireland. Tomorrow night’s Mega Draw EuroMillions event with a guaranteed € million jackpot is creating incredible excitement amongst our players. If a player in Ireland scoops this astonishing amount, it would bring to , the number of Irish EuroMillions jackpot winners since the game launched in Ireland in . And of course, there is a huge buzz around this weekend’s Lotto draw with the jackpot heading towards an estimated € million, the spokersperon said. The current Lotto jackpot has been on an unprecedented roll without a winner since June and is now edging very close to reaching the current jackpot cap. The Lotto jackpot is currently capped at €. million and this represents the record breaking Lotto jackpot win by the Dan Morrissey syndicate in Carlow in June . Once the jackpot exceeds the cap, no more money will be added to the jackpot prize until it is won. The funds that would normally go to the jackpot will be distributed to the next lower prize tier at which there are winners. If the jackpot is won at an amount higher than €. million, that amount will become the game’s new jackpot cap. “With two incredible jackpots in both EuroMillions and Lotto just a day apart, we are encouraging players to purchase their tickets early as we expect there to be a big uptake in sales ahead of the draw times. We are reminding players that the cut-off time for sales for EuroMillions tickets is at .pm on Friday evening while the cut-off time for sales for Lotto tickets is at .pm on Saturday evening. Tickets can be purchased in-store, on the National Lottery app or atwww.lottery.ie, the spokesperson said.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"--ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\".detachTo.detachTo   --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare  sticky_share_top . --    ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.waitForEl  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular MultimediaDown Memory Lane: Derrys Millennium Forum - ‘A place of hope’  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaAround the Schools: Take a trip down memory lane from the  Archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Emmett McConomy speaking to the crowd at Derrys GuildhallDerry NewsYou do not speak for the people of Derry overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Throwback: Out  About at River Inn, Derry  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Dr Anne McCloskey featured in a nine-minute video where she said that many people have been ldquocoerced, bribed or bullied into being vaccinated against Covid- and that vaccines were ldquomalevolentDerry NewsDerry doctor Anne McCluskey suspended from practicing medicine after Covid claims overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsAltnagevlin Hospital to move to -- visiting system overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Peter Bough, Buying Director with Aldi Ireland and Peter Mulrine, Managing Director of MulrinesBusinessDonegal company awarded new €.m contract to supply supermarket giant in Ireland and UK overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th September,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Whats OnThe Graham Norton Show is back!

Reporter: Gary Ferry Sept   addthis, A player who never let his team mates down, Kevin ‘Crack’ McKeever remained well known and well thought of throughout the city long after he stopped wearing the red and white of Derry City. Long-term City fans have been remembering ‘Crack’ this week following his sudden death at just  years of age, remembering a player who played in numerous positions for his team, with never a complaint. googletag.cmd.push A lelong civil servant, Kevin also worked for many years in Derry Crown Buildings and had two spells with his home town club during his playing days. He was part of the team which played in the club’s first ever league game in the League of Ireland, against EMFA in  at Buckley Park in October , and he ed to the Brandywell in  for a much longer spell. He made  appearances for Derry City overall, scoring  goals, and he has remained a popular figure locally since. With Portadown, Kevin spent just over four and a half seasons at Shamrock Park, scoring  goals in  appearances. He made  appearances scoring  times during the clubs’ first title winning season in   and a further  appearances scoring twice in the   double winning season. A minute’s silence will be held at the Brandywell tomorrow night in memory of the midfielder, ahead of the game between Derry City and Longford. Peter Hutton, who played alongside ‘Crack’ for two years at Derry, still remembers his first encounter of a man Portadown fans called ‘Big Tree’. “He was a lovely big fella,” he said. “My first recollection of Big Crack was when I made my debut for Coleraine when I was  or  in the Bass Irish Cup semi-final. We played an unbelievable Portadown team and Crack was playing in the middle of the park with Roy McCreadie and boys like Joey Cunningham and Alfie Stewart and boys like that.     “They beat us - and I remember this boy in the middle of the park with the long hair. He asked me afterwards was I from Derry and only then did I realise that he was from Derry himself.” Hutton and ‘Crack’ eventually became team mates a few years later, and while he was never the star of the team, he was someone everyone could rely on when needed. “He would have dropped into defence or midfield or just play wherever he was asked,” Hutton recalls. “It was the same at Portadown as well. He was held in high regard up there by the supporters and the players who thought the word of him. It was exactly the same at Derry, he was versatile and he would have just gone in and done a job anywhere. “Week in and week out he would have given you a seven or right out of ten he would never have let you down anywhere he was asked to play. He would just have got on with it and was low maintenance for managers he wouldn’t have been a fella demanding to be playing or causing ructionshe wasn’t picked.” FAI Cup memories ‘Crack’ was left frustrated when it came to the FAI Cup during his time at Derry. He played in the  - loss to Sligo Rovers, and was then an unused substitute in the  success against Shelbourne. He was never allowed to forget that loss against Sligo by team mates who needed little excuse for a bit of fun. “He loved the craic and the banter and the camaraderie in the changing rooms,” Hutton recalled. “He played in the final where we were beaten by Sligo. We always slagged him because it seemed that any chance we had in that game fell to Crack and he obviously didn’t score because we were beaten -. He got dog’s abuse off the players for it, but it was just in jest. “Obviously he didn’t get blamed for it but he did get dog’s abuse from the boys in the changing room for the chances he did miss. He scored in the next game we played against Sligo after that and he just got more abuse because he couldn’t do that in the final. He was just a lovely big fella who loved his football and he was just a nice fella to be around.” Funeral arrangements Kevin’s funeral will take place from his home,  Templegrove, tomorrowat .am to Holy Family Church, Ballymagroarty for Requiem Mass at .am.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Sept Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Longford Town  Goals from Jamie McGonigle, James Akintunde and Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe earned Derry City a comfortable win over Longford to move within three points of Sligo Rovers in third place. In a one-sided game, the Candystripes were too strong for the visitors. A fairly low-key start at the Brandywell ended when Derry City took the lead on  minutes. It was entirely preventable from a Longford point of view as Eoin Toal’s high ball forward was flicked on by Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe into the path of defender Joseph Manley. The centre-half hesitated however and Jamie McGonigle took advantage, charging the ball down and racing clear to finish past Lee Steacy for his second goal in a week. googletag.cmd.push It was all Derry City and they doubled their lead just before the half hour mark. This time McGonigle turned provider, as his ball in from the right picked out Will Fitzgerald in the area, and his touch set up James Akintunde, whose shot from  yards took a big deflection off a Longford leg to wrongfoot Steacy who could only watch as the ball rolled past him into the net. The Longford goalkeeper got his own slice of luck moments later as the Candystripes threatened to finish the game as a contest. Junior looked a touch ambitious when he lined up a free kick  yards from goal, but it was spilled by Steacy into the path of McGonigle, who would surely have made it - had an awkward bounce not taken the ball away from him at the crucial moment. The dynamic of a comfortable game almost changed just minutes into the second half when Darragh Nugent burst forward from midfield, into the area and around Nathan Gartside, but shanked his effort wide and over of the open goal.     That was as good as it got for Longford however, and Derry got their third goal nine minutes from time. Evan McLaughlin’s pass picked out the run of Danny Lafferty in behind the visitors’ defence, and although his volley was brilliantly parried by Steacy, the ball fell for Junior, whose shot into the ground bounced over the goalkeeper and into the net for -.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Sept Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Longford Town  Goals from Jamie McGonigle, James Akintunde and Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe earned Derry City a comfortable win over Longford to move within three points of Sligo Rovers in third place. In a one-sided game, the Candystripes were too strong for the visitors. A fairly low-key start at the Brandywell ended when Derry City took the lead on  minutes. It was entirely preventable from a Longford point of view as Eoin Toal’s high ball forward was flicked on by Junior Ogedi-Uzokwe into the path of defender Joseph Manley. The centre-half hesitated however and Jamie McGonigle took advantage, charging the ball down and racing clear to finish past Lee Steacy for his second goal in a week. googletag.cmd.push It was all Derry City and they doubled their lead just before the half hour mark. This time McGonigle turned provider, as his ball in from the right picked out Will Fitzgerald in the area, and his touch set up James Akintunde, whose shot from  yards took a big deflection off a Longford leg to wrongfoot Steacy who could only watch as the ball rolled past him into the net. The Longford goalkeeper got his own slice of luck moments later as the Candystripes threatened to finish the game as a contest. Junior looked a touch ambitious when he lined up a free kick  yards from goal, but it was spilled by Steacy into the path of McGonigle, who would surely have made it - had an awkward bounce not taken the ball away from him at the crucial moment. The dynamic of a comfortable game almost changed just minutes into the second half when Darragh Nugent burst forward from midfield, into the area and around Nathan Gartside, but shanked his effort wide and over of the open goal.     That was as good as it got for Longford however, and Derry got their third goal nine minutes from time. Evan McLaughlin’s pass picked out the run of Danny Lafferty in behind the visitors’ defence, and although his volley was brilliantly parried by Steacy, the ball fell for Junior, whose shot into the ground bounced over the goalkeeper and into the net for -.

James is a kopite so we won’t be talking to him, but I did ask Tomwhat he thought ofInvaderband’s first album  “Excellent that was why I decided to join up.” Do you think youll ever be able to play in a band with a bass player that enjoys football  “It’s good to have a bit of banter with him especially when we beat ‘Pool at Anfield.” What was it like making a record during lockdown  “Strange more so with not being in studio for  years.” Apart from the Nerve Centre online gig, how much do you want to get out and play live  “Can’t wait for album launch on  October first live gig with Jamsie in band”. They’re playing Bennigans on October th and you should head down.     I suppose the most important question and the one on everybody’s lips isare you a better drummer than others because you support Everton  “Obviously.” I recently asked Adam he feltInvaderband have improved since bringing an Everton fan in to play drums  “I do, yes. Tom is a brilliant drummer and he’s really enjoying it which has kind of reinvigorated the rest of us. Re: Everton. I asked him about this, and he said something about toffees. I’ve no idea. Football is for morons.” About his writing songs for a while,do you have a pile from the s you can just use, or do you still write away  “Yeah, I don’t need to write anymore because I have such an archive of ones from the s. That’s why they’re so good.“ The Beatles were recording I Want You ’ the day I was born, so it’s in my Northern English blood.” It’s almost like he’s lording it over us that the English colonised Ireland back when Adam was young, but while we’re on the subjecthow awful were the Beatles  “Only a moron would ask that question.” I know what you’re thinking, does Adam know what the word moron means  Probably not but as we’respeaking of terrible,you really like the Darkness  “The word you’re looking for is love. The Darkness are easily the most exciting band on Earth. No-one  comes close”. At this point I expect loads of people to have fired the paper in the bin, but I can’t stress strongly enough that this is not what we should judge Adam on.” We once enjoyed a fizzy pop at the Northern Ireland Music Prize in  when both Invaderband and Our Krypton Son were up for album of the year. It’s become a total nonsense but Invaderbands single I Wont Remember You is up for Best Single at this year’s NI Music Prize!  Invaderband drummer Tom Doherty  And they’re thankful for the recognition and have posted “please” vote for us here:shorturl.at ajzDLMany thanks!#nimpon their socials, which isn’t as cringeworthy as saying nothing and giving the impression that you’re entitled to it. Adam claims to be a Pavement fan and put me to the test and asked what my favourite song is…Stereo, for those that are interested… anyway he ridiculed me for not picking a more obscure one. At least I think that’s what he was doing but coming from a Beatles fan the point was lost, after all this is a man who once said Joy Division were hopeless. New Order even worse. I know, I know, but seriously, give Invaderband a chance, they’re very very good, check them out atinvaderbandand Facebook.

Any chemistry student is automatically tutored in such hazards, the campaignersrsquo letter continues.ldquoThis is not a new subject and CIL , had it been so worried about it, should have acted decades ago on the mercury issue. Your concerns now ring hollow and you are using the issue to pursue your own interests in the modernisation of lighthouses.Campaigners have asked CIL to provide evidence of what training was given to lighthouse keepers in mercury usage and what so-called Material Safety Data Sheets on mercury were and are supplied to lighthouses in its jurisdiction.They say they are not impressed with CILrsquos progress when it comes to environmental heritage matters, pointing to the many changes which have taken place at St Johnrsquos Point over the years, including a reduction in use of the borm Fresnel lens to single lens and the removal of the original mechanics that powered the rotating lens.Other changes highlighted by campaigners included the abolition of keepers and attendants and the planned reduction in maintenance of the Killough stationrsquos walls and outbuildings.The letter continues: ldquoWhilst several of these changes may be understandable, you go too far with the removal of the heritage rotation system and in the employment of LED as the light source. You must surely be aware of thegrowing concerns in the environmental community worldwide about LED lighting.ldquoThe Lecale Lightkeepers will further resist your plans for St Johnrsquos Point, but we urge you to take note of the facts and of the strong local opposition to your plan.Campaigners say they are prepared to cooperate with CIL and others in developing suitable preservation plans for the historic lighthouse, including the engine room, while the organisation maintain itrsquo important role as an Aid to Navigation.Their letter adds: ldquoKeeping the existing lens rotation system and a health and safety review of your LED plans are, however, prerequisites to our cooperation..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Downe U3A members enjoy fun day out  ","story":"MEMBERS of Downe UA had a marvellous and unusual day out at Crawfordrsquos Rock, near Kilkeel, recently.Local businesswoman Michelle Wilson took them, armed with collecting bags, on a foraging trip along the shore.She pointed out the dferent types of seaweed, telling which of them are best for cooking, which are ingredients of skin care products and which she recommended for a healthy seaweed bath.With their collected seaweeds the group then retreated to a gazebo on the shore where they were served up some shlauch mdash or shlucht mdash seaweed with seaweed bread and cod roe.This was followed by many courses of local produce, langoustines, mussels, crab toes, haddock landed fresh in Kilkeel that morning, then steak, potatoes, seaweed and chilli chocolate, ending with Crawfords Rock Seaweed Companyrsquos award-winning peppermint and kombu tea.The group agreed that it had been a day to remember.

Championship campaign with an impressive win over last yearrsquos runners-up Carryduff on a sun-drenched Saturday evening.Despite being considered slight underdogs before the contest, the green and white outfit proved they were anything but as they found the back of the net three times in the opening half.Goals from Oran Cunninghamand captain Conor McGrady put the Hoops too far in front at the interval, with the Carryduff men left frustrated at their missed chances.There was a notable turnout at the Darragh Cross venue, with waves of supporters from both sides allowing their voices to be heard throughout the duration of the match.Despite Carryduff winning the throw-in, it was Downpatrick who opened the scoring through a Jarlath Brannigan free after three minutes had been played.Brannigan doubled his tally just two minutes later in what was a determined start from the Hoops.However, this would be no stroll in the park as Josh Connery dummied his marker to send Carryduffrsquos first effort over the bar after some silky work from team-mate Owen McCabe.Downpatrick goalkeeper and joint captain James Deeny displayed pin-point accuracy with his kick-outs countless times throughout the match but perhaps needed the opening minutes to settle any nerves.A wayward punt upfield was gobbled up by Carryduffrsquos Pearse McCabe who relayed the ball quickly to Cian Clinton to level the scores.Caolan Mooney made his presence known with his usual rapid pace and precision. The former Rostrevor and current county player drew a foul before Conor McCarron calmly converted to put Downpatrick back in front.It was Carryduffrsquos turn to showcase their county talent as Daniel Guinness again levelled the tie with an emphatic point before captain Joe McFlynn swung the match back in their favour.However, with a minute to go to the first water-break Downpatrick got the reward for their relentless work in the middle of the park.McGrady and Mooney swarmed the Carryduff midfield with a barrage of tackles before some quick passing allowed the ball to enter into the hands of Downpatrickrsquos young forward Oran Cunningham.The Downpatrick number  made no mistake in blasting his effort past opposing lsquokeeper Mark Hynes to give his side a two-point lead.This advantage didnrsquot last until the quarter as Carryduff replied with two well-taken scores to bring the contest even.A few wides from both sides were observed after the water-break before Conor Doherty curled his left-footed free in-between the posts for Downpatrick.With  minutes played on the clock it was Cunningham again who would prove the major dference after his long-ranged effort looped over the head of Hynes and into the back of the net to double his tally.Hynes could be excused for this as Cunninghamrsquos effort struck most around the pitch as a cross rather than an attempt at goal.Nevertheless, Carryduff kept plugging away and answered with a James Guinness point.Conor McGrady saw his effort at goal crowded out by the determined opposing defenders before Gerdie Collins saw his effort drt over the bar to restore Downpatrickrsquos four-point lead.Mooney pointed again for the Hoops before McGrady added his sidersquos third goal of the half after the green and white forward line took advantage of a defensive mix-up.Daniel Guinness tried to rally his team as best as he could, soloing past three RGU shirts before registering the final point of the half. Half-time: Downpatrick - Carryduff -.Whatever the management team of Paddy Doherty, Shane OrsquoNeill and DJ Morgan told their Carryduff side during the interval must have struck a chord as they started the second half with clear intent.Despite a James Guinness wide, points from McCabe and McFlynn chipped away at the deficit for the purple, gold and black side.Cunningham was unlucky not to hit a hat-trick of goals after his lobbed effort was fantastically cleared of the line by Daniel Coogan.RGU followed this up with two efforts which both veered wide, before McFlynn again pointed for Carryduff leaving the score - to - in favour of the Downpatrick side at the second water-break.It was clear that legs were beginning to tire in the final quarter after a gruelling physical showing from both teams meant more and more chances went begging.Downpatrick finally registered their first point of the second half through another Doherty free.Carryduff refused to go quietly and were given added encouragement when RGUrsquos Tim Prenter was shown a black card with five minutes remaining.However, the frustration continued for both Carryduff and James Guinness as his effort veered wide of the target again.Deeny was rewarded for keeping his concentration after making an impressive save with his feet to deny Carryduff a certain goal in the dying moments of the game, although he could do nothing about the converted free a minute later.Mooney fisted over the bar in the next run of play for Downpatrick before Carryduff substitute Joe Tunney completed the scoring in the last passage of play.After the match, Downpatrick manager Aidan Robinson reflected on his sidersquos winning performance.ldquoIn the first half we worked incredibly hard, we turned the ball over a lot at the halfway line which we got a lot of scores from and we managed to get the goals, he said.ldquoWe built a good  for ourselves and spoke at half-time about kicking on from that, but we didnrsquot really manage to.ldquoI think in the third quarter of the game we were pretty flat and Carryduff got back into the tie, but we got over the line and we will learn from that.He added: ldquoIrsquom very happy with the result and very happy to be in the next round.Downpatrick: J Deeny, E Rooney, A Doherty, R Murphy, T Smyth, J Bell, C Doherty, D Turley, C McCarron, T Prenter, G Collins, C McGrady, J Brannigan, P Turley, C Mooney.Subs: A Og Robinson, M Fitzpatrick, O Cunningham, S Bell, T Loudon, T McNeill, N Cunningham, D Brannf, T Savage, C Boyd, R Og Quinn, C Farrell, R Quinn.Carryduff: M Hynes, D Coogan, C Cassidy, C McCullagh, L Toal, J Connery, D Guinness, B Cox, P McCabe, O McCabe, J McFlynn, C Clinton, S McGonigle, R Beatty, J Guinness.Subs: T Connery, M McGrath, P McConnell, C Sherry, R Reilly, C Cunningham, R Boyle, J Tunney, M Lawson, C Rooney, J Henry, D Connelly, D Connor.Downpatrick -Carryduff -MORGAN FUELS SFC ST ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Joanne.jpg","title":"Joanne organising event to thank Air Ambulance staff  ","story":"A LOCAL show jumper is organising a fund-raising campaign as her way of saying thank you to the Air Ambulance.Joanne Clough was airlted to hospital after suffering a serious head injury. A year on, she has launched the lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo campaign and competition to raise vital funds for Air Ambulance NI.On September  last year Joanne was competing in a show jumping competition at Ardnacashel Equestrian Centre near Comber, when a serious accident meant she needed urgent medical care.Joanne was warming up on her horse, Juno, when the horse seemed to become spooked and jolted, then began bucking uncontrollably, throwing her from the saddle. As she fell to the ground, Joanne hit her head on a brick wall.Joanne, who lives near Crossgar, said: ldquoI have no memory of the event and apparently lost consciousness. Having spoken to others, I know that the show at Ardnacashel was then stopped, and the organisers along with first aiders on site came to my side and called for an ambulance.ldquoEveryone was really supportive and helpful to ensure myself, my horse, my helper and my seven year-old daughter, Erin were looked after.The Air Ambulance carrying the Helicopter Emergency Medical Service Teamlanded in the fields beside Ardnacashel. The team treated Joanne at the scene before transferring her to the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast.Joanne remained in the hospital for the next  hours, having tests for potential brain injuries, which were even more pertinent as Joanne had undergone brain surgery to remove a tumour in August .Joanne sustained three fractures to her cheek, damaged the iris of her right eye, resulting in blurred vision, and lost her short-term memory for a couple of months due to severe concussion.It has been a long road to recovery, but now Joanne is starting to feel back to normal. She said: ldquoThe scars and fractures on my face have healed, along with the fatigue, weakness and confusion, but my balance remains something that I am continuing investigations for as my eyesight remains imperfect.ldquoMost importantly for a horsey girl, Juno has been treated for pre-existing injury in the sacroiliac joint in her back, which had caused her to react the way she did on the day. After a sincere apology from her, I am slowly gaining trust and confidence in her again in the saddle.Joanne continued: ldquoThere are no words to describe the gratitude I feel for the assistance of the Air Ambulance NI team and crew that day. Had they not acted so quickly, treated me with such level-headed efficiency and taken me to the hospital so swtly, I have no idea how I might have ended up.ldquoA head injury cannot be underestimated and to have been saved from potential disaster by the medical team in this way is a miraculous success. I owe them my everything and to demonstrate my gratitude, I am running a nationwide equestrian campaign and competition to raise awareness and funds for Air Ambulance NI. Thank you so much to the Air Ambulance team mdash you are amazing.With the recent easing of restrictions, Joanne was recently able to visit the Air Ambulance NI airbase and meet with representatives of the medical team.Joanne is encouraging the entire Equestrian Community to support her campaign. You can do so by Supporting the Horse Powered Take Off competition via https:dragoncompetitions product horse-powered-take-off .Including Ambulance NI in your horse show, such as by making a small donation from ticket sales.Organising your own lsquoHorse Powered Take Offrsquo event, such as a cake sale, tea party, sponsored give away, or hack and snack.Working alongside Dragon competitions, Joannersquos competition will run throughout September and October and she has secured some fabulous prizes, including an equine bundle worth pound, from Fane Valley, pound, in cash and a horse solarium worth pound from R Nesbit Paddock Equipment. The winners will be drawn on October  by Dragon Competitions.Grace Williams, Area Fundraising Manager for Air Ambulance NI, said: ldquoWe are so inspired that Joanne has made a great recovery. Patients are at the centre of everything we do, and it is always lovely when patient families choose to get in touch.ldquoWe are humbled she decided to support the of wonderful work of Air Ambulance NI through her equestrian competition and campaign.ldquoAs a service we rely heavily on charitable donations to keep the medical team in the air, delivering critical care to patients who have suffered trauma throughout Northern Ireland.

For that particular scene, we approached Kilmore Coach Hire who drove us around the village until we got what we needed.The cast and crew also filmed inside Bright Parish Church before they set off to allow a christening to take place.ldquoWe were lucky the farmer who owned the surrounding fields was so generous in allowing us to film, as well as the church minister, said Declan.ldquoIt was kindness such as this from the locals which allowed us to make this happen.The McIlmail duo were not the only local faces who appeared in the award winning short, as Newcastlersquos Sandra Brown portrays lsquoMaggiersquo and Crossgarrsquos Chris Heath takes up the role of lsquoEamonrsquo.Notably, not all of these cast members have actually met each other in person. Due to the restrictions in place, actors only metthey were in the same scene.Declanrsquos cousin, Aroacuten Holden from Downpatrick, was the editor for the film who helped piece each scene together. Aroacuten also introduced Declan to a number of others who assisted in creating the short, and therefore was referred to as ldquoan invaluable help by the young director.The short continues to enter numerous film festivals in the hopes of adding more honours, including ceremonies in England, Scotland and the USA.Meanwhile, Declan is currently directing a new featurefilm based in Belfast named lsquoThe Trick Roomrsquo, which entails the story of a cross-community cricket team.To keep up to date with the latest news surrounding Shine, visit @shine_shortfilm on Instagram or check out https:www.imdb title tt ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/22September2021-Jockeys.jpg","title":"Locals among the prizes at Downpatrick meeting  ","story":"IT was a good day for local owners and trainers at Fridayrsquos penultimate meeting of the year at Downpatrick.They were successful in three of the seven races on the card, that featured four over hurdles, two chases and a bumper.

There is also the potential to add morethey are required.While three options have been drawn up, members of the local authorityrsquos Active and Healthy Communities Committee favour one that involves reconfiguring a meeting room and foyer into one large, open space with a new extension to the front to a  square metre multi-purpose room.In addition, two changing rooms are to be knocked into one with a  square metre kitchen area.A third changing room is to be converted to provide a so-called changing places toilet and there is also a store area for the meeting area.Asking the public for its view mdash which must be submitted online by Wednesday, September  mdash council officials say they recognise there is a need renovate the existing centre to meet current demands and services the community expects.In addition, Rowallane area councillors have highlighted concerns that currently, only one activity can take place at the centre at a time due to the current layout. They also recognise the need to offer additional space for extra activities.As part of the consultation process, residents are asked to complete a small online questionnaire, with all information used by the council to determine the best way forward.News of the proposal to upgrade the community centre comes after the local authority was asked to address its under investment in the market town and ensure that enhancing leisure facilities was a critical component of its future investment plans.Earlier this year, the need for ultra-modern leisure provision topped the agenda during an online meeting between local politicians and senior council officials who were asked to examine the potential of extending and upgrading the existing community centre at Windmill Street or a complete new-build, potentially on available land at the townrsquos Langley Road or at the Newcastle Road.Major new leisure provision has recently been provided across the council area, including Downpatrick, Saintfield and Newry, with plans in the pipeline for signicant investment in new leisure services in Newcastle.Politicians say that while Ballynahinch has missed out on major local authority investment over recent years, the organisation needs to address this now to cater for the needs of local people and sporting organisations.They argued that the current community centre needs major improvement or potentially replaced and that funding must be earmarked to allow this to happen.Politicians say itrsquos vital that Ballynahinch is a key part of any future council strategy when it comes to leisure activities.Several councillors believe the current Ballynahinch Centre requires signicant investment to meet the needs of local people and while many favour a new-build, they recognise that this is unlikely in the short to medium term.Moving forward, they say Ballynahinch cannot be left behind given that it has missed out on major funding for a signicant number of years and that ratepayers in the town and surrounding area deserve nothing less.The consultation closes at pm on Wednesday, September  and to take part, log on at https:tinyurl uejtmpc.

The show required proof of Covid double vaccines or other tests to gain entry but even so it could have adopted an even stricter approachThe Alliance MLA Sorcha Eastwood says in a tweet, quoted above, says she has loved it since her aunt took her when she was in P.My memory of Balmoral goes back even further, to when I was about three and my grandfather, James T Kernohan, worked at the King’s Hall for the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society .I was reminded of that yesterday as I walked through the major amusement park rides that they have now at the show.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...There was nothing like that when I was a child. It was enjoyable enough to clamber up the vast, then state-of-the-art, combine harvesters that they had on display.It was good to see Balmoral having expanded in such ways.It was grey and at points drizzly at Balmoral yesterday yet the atmosphere was happy — perhaps due to the yearning of people to be able to get back to such gatherings. I was struck by Balmoral’s Covid requirements: either proof of full vaccination, or proof of a recent negative NHS Lateral Flow test, or proof of antibodies from PCR test.These seemed to be to be responsible requirements for an event of many people in close proximity. Indeed they seemed to me to be a minimum, because proof of a negative Lateral Flow test on its own is not a strict requirement, due to the possibility of ‘ negatives’ .I agree with Colum Eastwood, SDLP leader, on vaccine passports.A curious feature of Covid is the bitterly ided way in which many people approach the topic.Hardcore anti lockdown believers morph into anti vaxxers.Zero Coviders want severe shutdowns and dismiss any attempt to assess the overall cost of that tactic.And both sides seem to be, at best, selective in use of statistics.For example, I have been since the beginning a mild lockdown sceptic. This was not because lockdown doesn’t work — it obviously doesyou deprive people of all human contact. My concern was whether coronavirus was worth such drastic measures. This is still not clear, because we still do not know the exact societal cost in loneliness, mental illness, impact on non Covid NHS treatments, impact on economies, ruined livelihoods, impaired education and so on.In particular the enduring inequality of it all. The way the public sector is untouched and politicians won’t even countenance, say, a % pay cut to non frontline public sector workers to help fund the devastated self employed.Or the inequality of much of the population living through confinement in houses with ample outdoor space, and others stuck in flats with no garden. These are among reasons we must avoid third lockdown. Yet hardcore lockdown supporters rarely seem to acknowledge these problems. They dismissed the importance of statistics that showed the massive age gradient to Covid, in particular the almost non existent risk to the under s. Yes, the Delta iant has somewhat changed that, and there is a worry with long Covid, but even so it is overwhelmingly fatal only for people who are already gravely ill or nearing end of le.But those of us who accept that reality should be embracing vaccine requirements, and yet many lockdown sceptics are anti such an approach, talking of freedom of choice rather than compulsion. But they should embrace compulsion, in order to ensure freedom of action and freedom of movement!The value of the vaccines is clear in Northern Ireland hospitals intensive care stats. Some % of people in ICUs are entirely unvaccinated, while only % of the adult population is without even one jab.Yet these statistics are turned on their head. It is said that % of people in ICU are double jabbed which proves they don’t work. In fact, given that % of adults in NI have had both doses, it shows you vaccinations slash risk of a severe response to Covid . I was slow to get double jabbed because, in my s, I felt at low risk and the vulnerable people I care about had already had both doses before I became eligible. I soon realised that I was not thinking hard enough about my possible role in spreading infections. I have had both jabs since summer, and think it is a fair bargain for society to open up extensively but give preferential access to people who have two doses.I understand the dismay of people who have loved ones in care homes, and who got their double doses so that they could safely visit, and yet are seeing that resident potentially cared for by staff who have not protected themselves against Covid in the way the relative has.This is all the more painful given how people were not able to see visit home residents for so long.It is a tricky issue because there is already a shortage of care staff. Even so, England is right to move to compulsion for such carers in the coming weeks.• Ben Lowry: A sunny autumn day in Co Down banishes some of my equinox gloom• Ben Lowryis News Letter acting

But not long ago there was strong Eurosceptical sentiment south of the borderThe ‘It’ in question being his Holy Grail-like obsession to create a pan-European army.In the middle of last week the French President once more floated the idea of an EU-wide military force of around , personnel. This time around Macron’s recooked proposal was prompted by the sting of betrayal after the Australians reneged on a deal to buy French submarines opting instead to purchase American made subs. This switch by the Aussies was in large part due to Down Under joining a new military alliance in the Pacic alongside the United States and the UK.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Henry McDonald is a formerand Observer Ireland correspondent and author of books including a biography of David Trimble and INLA: Deadly DivisionsIf Macron’s dream of an alternative European army ever does become reality there is one nation within the EU family of nations he definitely cannot rely on: the Republic of Ireland.The corner stone of Irish foreign policyis military neutrality. Ireland never joined Nato although it has a long and commendable record in sending its military around the world on UN peacekeeping duties. None the less the odds of the Irish Defence Forces providing recruits to a new pan EU army in the foreseeable future are remote.Amid all the gushing, uncritical public discourse in the Republic regarding all things EU these days it is worth remembering that not very long ago there was a powerful Eurosceptical sentiment south of the border. Twelve years ago, in the first referendum on the Lisbon Treaty Irish voters rejected the treaty by .% as opposed to .% who backed the drive towards greater EU integration.One of the principal reasons why Ireland initially voted No was over fears about threats to Irish neutrality and concern about conscription into a European army. Although it was debatableLisbon actually entailed any compulsion to join an EU military force the spectre of it was enough to chill a signicant segment of the Irish electorate.The Dublin government at the time sought to allay these fears but also make the Irish vote again in a second referendum, which was in itself a massive anti-democratic con trick. As someone who reported from the frontline of the later protests against EU imposed austerity measures on the Republic after the Celtic Tiger collapsed and the state headed towards national bankruptcy I often wonder what that second vote would have beenit had been held in the middle of the economic shock treatment being applied from Brussels, Frankfurt, Berlin and the IMF.During those days of protests in  and  I followed tens of thousands marching through Dublin demonstrating against the EU and European Central Bank’s austerity-imposed cuts on Irish public services. I can still hear the speeches from public commentators denouncing the bureaucrats in Brussels, Angela Merkel in Berlin and the bankers at the ECB in Frankfurt on s such as one outside the GPO in O’Connell Street. It’s funny to listen to some of these same voices now in the post-Brexit era lavishing their praise and support on the EU while engaging in some old-fashioned Brit-bashing.In Northern Ireland too there are lots of these voices articulating a misty eyed, sentimental longing to be back in the EU. Nationalists meanwhile are using the enticement of EUas an argument someone for a United Ireland wrapped inside a reunited Europe. As someone who didn’t actually vote for Brexit I am still perplexed over the suspension of critical faculties when it comes to what the EU does in practice as opposed to its rhetoric.Having reported  years ago during that Holy Week of negotiations leading to the Belfast Agreement I cannot recall and none of my colleagues from the time can either the letters E and U being mentioned. Aside from peripheral peace building projects and welcome structural funding, the EU was not a major player in the torturous discussions that eventually created the Good Friday Agreement. Their interference post Brexit in Northern Ireland’s politics and in particular the imposition of the Protocolhowever has the potential to unravel that settlement.For its own economic and strategic interests the EU has used Northern Ireland as a means to punish Britain for leaving the union. By doing so it has generated a widespread perception across the unionist community that the EU is now in league with one side in a ided society – Irish nationalism, north and south. Before Brexit the EU at least had a positive reputation for being neutral on the Northern Ireland question.Irish foreign policy neutrality will undoubtedly prevail evenPresident Macron ever gets his way and establishes his EU army. With the imposition of an Irish Sea Border and the refusal, at least so far, of Brussels to compromise on frontier checks including even medicines EU neutrality in Northern Ireland no longer exists. • Henry McDonald Sep : Row involving President Higgins confirms that those who want a tolerant Ireland are being marginalised• Ruth Dudley Edwards Sep : New NIO minister is a Gay Catholic Tory who will listen to unionist fears• Owen Polley Sep : Dublin would be horriedfaced with an all-Ireland state• Other articles by Henry McDonald below, beneath that information on how to subscribe to the News Letter:• Henry McDonald Sep : Journalists should shun this Dublin-funded study into how the media uses language• Henry McDonald Sep : The cross border policing pursuit plan has not been thought through• Henry McDonald Aug : INLA’s biggest propaganda coup since Wright murder• Henry McDonald Aug : Irish nationalists can’t rely on Biden, as Kabul shows——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

We are saying that he didn’t raise them with us.”Sir Jeffrey said the church leaders’ statement showed that there was “no known diplomatic attempt” to alter anything about the event.He added: “The rejection of this event by the Irish head of state signals to unionists that the presidential office does not respect Northern Ireland as an entity and has little or no interest in a shared future with unionism.“Such a stance demonstrates how far the office under Michael D Higgins has drted from the shared future principles it once espoused. This disrespect for the existence of Northern Ireland indicates that Michael D Higgins’ office is really a united Ireland champion rather than a leader of reconciliation.”The DUP leader continued: “This saga has been a sad reflection on many years of outreach by unionists like me and others. I have travelled theand breadth of the island showing respect and explaining unionism.“I have stood in gardens of remembrance with my head bowed to show respect for people who were opponents of the Union. But I recognised that to take those steps was important to heal ision.“Rather than reciprocate on this occasion, Michael D Higgins has not only devalued and undermined such steps, but he has set back north-south relations to the detriment of the office which he holds.”Last week Mr Higgins said his decision to decline the invitation to the service had come after six months of consideration.He said: “That’s the beginning, so it isn’t a sudden decision, the decision is the outcome of a consideration.”He also challenged the DUP criticism of his decision.“It’s a bit much, to be frank with you.

We install energy-efficient boilers, which will help you save money on your energy bills whilst achieving our goal to reduce carbon emissions in the UK.\"Check your eligibility and start the simple process by clicking hereWho is First Choice Energy Limited First Choice Energy Limited is based in Dafen Industrial Park, Llanelli.It is passionate about creating a more sustainable world by improving energy systems for homeowners in Wales and is extremely proud to be certied ECO installers helping residents live in more energy-efficient homes - while making our environment more sustainable and eco-friendly.Director Aaron Davies took on the business from his father, who has been in the trade for nearly  years and is still very much hands-on with the team.First Choice Energy Limited is a registered on the Gas Safe Registered Engineers list, it is endorsed by Trustmark Government Endorsed Quality and is Blue Flame approved.What benefits are considered Eligibility for a free boiler grant will depend on several factors. Firstly, a permanent resident within the property needs to be in receipt of one of the following benefits, such as:Armed Forces Independence PaymentAttendance AllowanceCarerrsquos AllowanceChild BenefitConstant Attendance AllowanceDisability Living AllowancePension Guarantee CreditIncome-related Employment and Support Allowance Income-based Jobseekerrsquos Allowance Income SupportIndustrial Injuries Disablement BenefitMobility SupplementPersonal Independence PaymentSevere Disablement AllowanceTax Credits Universal CreditWhat is EC  Funding The Energy Company Obligation or ECO is the name given to the UK Governments programme to make houses more energy efficient on a nationwide basis.The current ECO scheme, ECO, is scheduled to run until  March  and is focused exclusively on lower-income households, a wide range of benefit recipients qualy for improvements in their homes energy efficiency, with measures including new heating systems and boiler upgrades, external insulation, internal insulation and loft insulation as well as double glazing and more.What does the process involve First, fill in the Grant Eligibility Survey to seeyou qualy for the free boiler. Providing you are eligible, the team at First Choice Energy Ltd will speak to you on the phone and then come out and survey your home. This will include things like measuring your floor space, checking the thermostats on your radiators, identying the brand and model of your current gas boiler and asking some general questions regarding your property. A survey generally takes no longer than an hour.When itrsquos time to install a new boiler, your previous boiler will be replaced with a new gas-fired condensing boiler and the floor insulation will be fitted by a carpenter. Although the process sounds messy and time-consuming, on average it takes no longer than a day. And of course, the cost to install the boiler and install the floor insulation is covered by the grant.Will I need to pay any contributions Householders that are eligible for free boiler grants have no obligation to pay back any installments. Plus there are no terms and conditions to be met other than the basic qualying criteria.Why do I need a new boiler Your boiler may be on its way out, or not working properly, so now is the time to act. With energy bills more expensive than ever, your boiler needs to be heating your home for the lowest possible cost. A boiler installed around  years ago will most likely be around -% efficient. So, by upgrading this old boiler to a new one, the carbon savings will be signicant enough to warrant the cost and therefore will qualy under the free boiler scheme.Boilers installed in the UK are required to be condensing boilers. These are far more efficient than traditional boilers as they release gas at just  degrees Celsius , therefore requiring less energy to generate the same amount of heat.What happensI am not eligible The team at First Choice Energy may be able to help you with other grant schemes or offer advice and guidance on how to help with any problems you could face.For more information visit First Choice Energy Ltd or email: Firstchoiceenergylimited@gmail article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Brought to you byFIRST CHOICE ENERGY s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityRecent years have seen increasing numbers of the Grey seal population breeding in and around the lagoon and spotting them is an exciting wildle encounter that many visitors wonrsquot forget.However, the combination of the Blue Lagoons high visitor numbers, and its sheltered nature which makes it so attractive to seals, creates a situation where there is a high potential for disturbance to seals.The time seals spend resting on land is vital to their health and that of their pups as they are digesting a recent meal, socialising, and feeding their young.Blue Lagoon to closeIn order to provide them with a safe environment to raise their pups, National Trust Cymru will be closing the Blue Lagoon to visitors from September  through to November .Visitors will still be able to watch these wild creatures in their habitat from the coastal path and coasteering activity providers who have signed up to the National Trustrsquos Coasteering Agreement and undertaken specic training on how to operate around seals, will still have access to the lagoon with groups of visitors who have booked in advance.Mark Underhill, National Trust Cymrursquos Countryside Manager, Pembrokeshire said: ldquoThere are two species of seal that can be found in Britain the Common seal and the Grey seal. Only Grey seals occur regularly in Pembrokeshire, where they are present all year around.ldquoAbout half the worldrsquos population of Grey Seal breed on our coastline and the total number in West Wales, mostly Pembrokeshire, is estimated to be about ,, with some , pups being born each year.ldquoThe breeding season is vital for our seal colonies here in Pembrokeshire, and we ask that visitors do not access the Blue Lagoon and that they follow the guidelines laid out by the Seal Alliance and Pembrokeshire Marine Code when on the coastal path.Paul Renfro from the Pembrokeshire Coastal Forum said: ldquoThe Pembrokeshire Marine Code recommends remaining at least m away from the seals, though they can be disturbed at any distance so itrsquos important to be responsive to their behaviour.     ldquoIf a resting seal looks up or turns to looks at you then you are close enough at whatever distance you are at. Seals can be particularly sensitive to disturbance after periods of stormy weather and during the breeding season so we recommend giving them extra space at these times.How to avoid disturbing sealsTo avoid disturbing seals at this very important time of year, National Trust Cymru recommends adopting the following strategies:Sssh, stay quiet: Channel your inner David Attenborough and speak with a low voice and encourage your children to do the same. Noisy dogs can frighten seals soyour four-legged friend is a bit chatty, please leave them at home when you visit a seal breeding area.Donrsquot get too close: Ensure you stay at least  metres away from sealsand never come between a seal and her pup, or a seal and the sea. Doing so will cause distress to both the mother and pup.Keep dogs on a short lead: Keep your dog on a short lead. Do not allow them to run loose or play with balls, frisbees or sticks anywhere near a breeding colony as this will cause them distress.What to doyou see a seal in distressIf you spot a lone seal pup on a beach itrsquos probably not in distress. Seal pups are often left alone on the beach whilst its mum goes off to catch dinner.Never approach the seal. It will cause further distress and may be dangerous for you and the Seal.Look to see how many people there are about. In most cases when seals are in distress itrsquos due to contact with curious and well-meaning visitors.If you are still concerned, contact conservation group Welsh Marine Le Rescue   or   who will be able to offer you further guidance. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

He added: ldquoSupermarkets alone have estimated they need at least , HGV drivers for their businesses to be able to operate at full capacity ahead of Christmas and avoid disruption or availability issues.The relaxation of immigration rules was welcomed by other industry groups, however, with Food and Drink Federation chief Ian Wright calling the measures ldquopragmatic, while Logistics UK said it showed Government had listened to hauliersrsquo concerns.Richard Walker, managing director at Iceland supermarket, called the announcement ldquocritical and pushed for shop staff and other key workers to be fast-tracked past petrol pump queues.The supermarket boss said: ldquoUntil this eases, key workers including food retail workers need to be prioritised at the pumps so that we can keep hospitals operating and food shops open, and the nation safe and fed.As well as the visa changes, the Department for Transportsaid it planned to train , more lorry drivers through both a pound million investment in skills camps and established adult education budgets, with some of those studying for HGV licences eligible to have their courses paid for by the state.Meanwhile, the Ministry of Defencewill be stepping in to provide examiners for lorry driving tests as ministers look to steadily increase the size of the workforce.Officials said the loan of MoD examiners to work alongside Driver and Vehicle Standards Agencyemployees would help put on ldquothousands of extra tests over the next  weeks.The coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated a global shortage of lorry drivers, although there have been long-term issues in the UK with vacancy numbers amid an ageing workforce, low wages and poor truck stop conditions.In a drive to encourage people toto the industry, nearly one million letters will be landing on the doormats of people with HGV licences in the coming days enticing them to give the job another go.The letter will set out the steps the haulage sector is taking to improve industry conditions, including increased wages, flexible working and fixed hours, according to the DfT.Officials said the Government was focused on raising pay and improving working conditions and ersity of the workforce, rather than relying on cheap foreign workers to fill vacancies in the long run.The DfT said it recognised that importing foreign labour ldquowill not be the long term solution to the problem and that it wanted to see investment poured into establishing a robust domestic workforce..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Foreign HGV driver visa plan  uinsufficient u to fix Christmas supply chain issues article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She was loving mother of daughter Julie mother-in-law of Colin , and devoted nanny of Lily, , and Isla, seven. Tandragee-born Sally and Bessbrook man Billy lived at Knockview Drive, Tandragee and were married for  years.The funeral service was on Monday at Tandragee Presbyterian Church where more than  mourners gathered in the church and adjoining church hall to pay a final lasting tribute to Sally. The service was conducted by the minister the Rev Mark McMaw, assisted by the Rev Stephen Kennedy, minister of Buckna Presbyterian church, Broughshane, and nephew of Billy.Danny Kennedy, brother-in-law of Sally, paid a fulsome tribute to a woman, who, he said, was respected and loved in Tandragee and in the wider community.He said: “This tribute was, in large measure, composed by Billy himself and I do want to convey the deep emotions expressed in it. Sally and Billy were married  years and Billy has described her as ‘a highly principled woman’ with very sterling qualities and positive attitude to le.“Sally was the youngest daughter of three to Daniel and Elizabeth Berry, of Scarva Road, Tandragee. Her sisters Jean , Tandragee and Betty , Loughgall and their families featured strongly all through her le, to the very end. “Sally’s father sadly died at the age of  when Sally was just . After leaving school, she worked at Sinton’s mill before working at Tayto where she was a much-valued member of staff for  years, forming close friendships with colleagues that endured long after her retirement.“Sally and Billy met on the local dance scene in around . They both enjoyed dancing to the Irish showbands and Billy was attracted to Sally’s natural good looks, radiant smile, and always well-dressed appearance. They had good and happy times together tripping the light fantastic!“They got engaged in October , and were married on July , , in Ballymore parish church, Tandragee. Sally, from the Church of Ireland Billy a Presbyterian. It was a mixed marriage! Sally became a Presbyterian and was a communicant in the Tandragee congregation.“For a short time, they lived with Sally’s widowed mother at Scarva Road, before moving to Cornmarket Street where they resided until moving to the newly built development at Knockview Drive in . By then, they had a young daughter, Julie, who was just six months when they moved to Knockview. “The Kennedy’s of Knockview were a close family of three, with Julie very attached to her mum especially. Sally and Julie were soul mates, and the bond became closer when Julie, after her marriage to Colin Beattie, had two daughters Lily and Isla. Sally loved her grand-daughters they were her pride and joy and, in recent times, when they visited the care home to see their nanny after Sally’s stroke, her joyful reaction was obvious. The girls would sing and converse lovingly with their nanny.“Sally was intensely proud of her home it was her castle and she enjoyed making it a special place for her family. She was very supportive of Billy in his career as a journalist with the News Letter, working long hours as news editor in Belfast during years of the Troubles. Sally, as a loyal Tandragee lady also encouraged Billy in his role with the loyal orders in the Bessbrook area.“Even though she had little interest in sport, Sally was also supportive of Billy’s considerable football interests with Linfield Football Club, as a director for  years. But she could read Billy like a book and when Linfield lost, she would quickly ask when he arrived home occasionally looking disconsolate from Windsor Park - ’Well, did the Blues get bate today ’ “Sally had a dry wit and enjoyed a laugh. She also was very supportive of Billy’s frequent travels to the United States for several decades for research for  books he wrote on the Scots-Irish Ulster-Scots migration and settlements. Sally, indeed, was in America with Billy on the day of the   attacks in New York and Washington in . They were in Knoxville in East Tennessee with an Ulster-Scots group.“Sally enjoyed good food, best holidays and she liked to dress in fine clothes. Over their time together, many happy holidays were spent in Portrush, Bournemouth, Scotland, Spain, Italy , United States and Canada. The  Canada holiday was particularly enjoyable as they travelled over the Rocky Mountains by train from Calgary and Toronto to Vancouver. It was the holiday of a letime!. “Sally, like Billy, also loved American country music and enjoyed going to concerts in Belfast to hear the leading American singing stars. She was also a fan of Daniel O’Donnell, and, of course a big Elvis Presley fan.“Sally’s stroke on April , , was a harsh, le-changing blow to not only herself, but to Julie and Billy also. She lost her speech and was immobilised down the right side. Her time spent in hospital and in Rosemount care home in Portadown lasted two and a half years, but the medical and nursing staff there provided top quality care which complimented the love and devotion of her family. “She became an integral part of Rosemount, and the family is indebted to everyone there for their   work with a special lady, who was a model patient in challenging circumstances.”Danny added: “Most importantly, Sally was a woman of simple dedicated Christian faith who every night got down on her knees to pray to God, her Saviour and friend. Her values were of the highest standard. Sally will live on in our hearts and her memory will be cherished by all who knew and loved her as a devoted we, mother, mother-in-law, grandmother, sister and aunt, and friend to all those who came to know her. In Billy’s words - ‘Sally was a class act, loved and respected by everyone in her own family and wider community. “Sally loved her family her family loved her.

struggling to find new management for Portadown marketThree months after failing to attract any bidders, Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough is set to re-release the tender for the management of Portadown town market.By The NewsroomFriday, th September , : amUpdated Friday, th September , : am  \"       \"  Following discussions of the matter at a meeting of Council’s economic development and regeneration committee on Tuesday, September  a Council spokesperson told the local democracyreporting service the tender will be advertised the week ending Friday, October .“The tender will be advertised until Friday, October  and Council would ideally like to have an operator in place by January , , subject to statutory approvals,” said a Council spokesperson.“Once the tender has been advertised, interested parties will be able to apply through theeTenders NI portal.”During the committeemeeting, members were provided with an update on the regeneration of Portadown town centre and the role a high quality local market will play in this.They were advised that following Council’s decision to bring its service level agreementwith the market’s former operator, Portadown , to an end, five expressions of interest were receivedfrom parties interested in operating and managing a market in the town.Following a public consultation a tender was advertised on Friday, May  and closed on Friday, June , no tenders were receivedas part of the procurement process.Since then, Council has been in ongoing consultation with traders in Portadown to reassure them of Council’s plans to locate the market in a section of the Magowan West car park.It is understood Council is keen to see the market operate two times a week with optional daytime or evening operational times.Commenting on the report, Councillor Lavelle McIlwrath askedCouncil had consulted with the former market’s traders.Council’s head of regeneration, Nicola Wilson said Council has had a “busy summer” talking to traders and businesses through its consultation hub but had not been involved in direct consultation with the previous market’s traders.“In relation to the consultation with the existing market traders, we have not done that as we did not think it was an appropriate thing to do,” said Ms Wilson.“They are looking for a covered market space and that is not something we are going to be able to provide for them.“We have spoken to a lot of the town’s traders and a lot of the traders along Woodhouse Street as well to clary what we really want.“We will soon be in a position to go out with a tender that is more precise and detailed, I think that was probably one of the stumbling blocks in our first attempt to get a market provider in.“We are looking for an appropriate organisation to come in and provide the market service and that agent will be the one that will be liaisingwith the markets traders to try to develop what they need within the offering they have.”Read this - Club rallies round after

These changes will bring all Western Trust Hospital sites back in line with the regional Department of Health visiting guidance for the first time since the beginning of the fourth COVID surge in mid-July. Commenting on the new guidance, Western Trust Executive director of Nursing, Primary Care and Older Peoples Services, Dr Bob Brown, said: “As a Trust we recognise the importance of visiting patients in Hospitals and that it can be a great support, particularly for older people. “We want to be able to facilitate safe, secure visiting in as controlled and risk managed a way as possible and for that reason, looking at the transmission rates and evaluating risk assessments from across all of our Hospitals, from Monday, September  we will implement consistent visiting arrangements in all Trust facilities for one visitor per patient for one hour, once a day. “Some exceptions will be made in special circumstances, for example, given the clinical vulnerability of the patient group, particularly in the haematology setting, visiting in the North West Cancer Centre will continue to be restricted to assessment on an inidual basis involving the patient, family and team.” It has also been announced that these conditions will also apply to both COVID and ICU wards, where in the interests of patient safety visitation will be by inidual negotiation with Ward Managers on a case by case basis. More frequent visiting in exceptional circumstances, such as at the end of le will continue to be permitted, as will visiting for birthing partners to maternity services, each in an inidually risk assessed way. Paediatric wardsin Altnagelvin and South West Acute Hospital will continue to permit a parent to be at the child’s bedside, again ensuring this is risk assessed and in a COVID- secure way. This position will be reviewed again on Friday, October . The Western Trust is also encouraging members of the public to complete lateral flow tests before visiting any of its premises to provide confidence to both visitors and staff that visitors are not COVID positive and to help the Trust maintain COVID safe environments for all. These visiting arrangements will remain under constant review and may change in response to any further increase in infection rates impacting on any particular department, eg an inability to retain a COVID- secure environment of care. The safety of patients and staff will always be to the forefront of any decision made, the Trust says. Patients have been reminded only to attend AE alone, where possible. Children and vulnerable adults can be accompanied by one person.\",\"keywords\":\"Western Trust,visiting,restrictions,--\",\"articleSection\":\"News\",\"publisher\":,\"image\":,\"description\":\"THE Western Trust has announced that all of its Hospital sites are to move to the same lsquo--rsquo visiting restrictions, , with effect from Monday, September  .\",\"author\":,\"dateCreated\":\"--T::Z\",\"dateModied\":\"--T::Z\",\"datePublished\":\"--T::Z\" cmspos   *** Handle jQuery plugin naming conflict between jQuery UI and Bootstrap *** .widget.bridge@-webkit-viewport @-moz-viewport@-ms-viewport @-o-viewport@viewport - Twitter, Inc.
