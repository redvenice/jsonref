It is unclear if any more are still set to be brought in from previous deals. The Department of Health paid out roughly £585million on contracts securing visors.This suggests ministers paid the equivalent of nearly £4.80 per visor used, roughly 24 times more than the shields cost when bought in bulk. And of its surplus stock, 339,154,151 are deemed \u0027not fit for use in healthcare settings\u0027. SAGE advisors warned visors were unlikely to give \u0027any protection\u0027 against Covid transmission in July 2020, with the Government placing its last order for visors at the end of June 2020."},{"url":null,"title":"Welcome Britains Capital Woke Oxfordshire UKs right county","story":"Share this articleOxford zero emissions zone launched in city centre - BBC News"},{"url":null,"title":"Le Pen closes gap Macron French election campaigns ends today ahead vote Sunday","story":"Ms Le Pen’s National Rally party is still paying off a loan worth some £8million to a Russian bank.The far-right leader has long been a firm ally of Mr Putin, though she has criticised Russian war crimes in Ukraine.It comes as Le Pen continues to press for extreme policies including fines for Muslim women who use headscarves to cover their faces in public.‘People will be given a fine in the same way that they are for illegally not wearing seat belts,’ she suggested.Ms Le Pen has also pledged to cut immigration by as much as 75 per cent and to clamp down on new arrivals from bringing their families to France.Le Pen\u0027s efforts to moderate her far-right image were boosted by the candidacy of the even more radical candidate ex-TV pundit Éric Zemmour. Veteran Left wing candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon was also enjoying a rise in his poll figures. He is expected to win around 17 per cent in the first round, and could feasibly pip Ms Le Pen to a place in the second round run-off.That would be a relief for Mr Macron, a former banker and civil servant who formed his own political movement to challenge for power.He hopes to become the first sitting French president to be re-elected for 20 years. The last head of state to achieve this was Jacques Chirac, who was elected president in 1997 before gaining a second, final term in 2002. The first round of this year\u0027s presidential election will take place on Sunday, with the top two candidates going head-to-head two weekends later on April 24."},{"url":null,"title":"easyJet slammed sharing photo customer flight number tattooed wrist","story":"Share this article Another social media user responded: \u0027Holy s***.

Emma McInnes, Global Head of Financial Services at YouGov, says: When the Ukraine war began, the rouble plunged from below 80 to the US dollar to as low as 135 roubles$1.  But it has now recovered to near February’s pre-invasion levels, supported by capital controls including a ban on banks and brokers selling dollars, euros and other foreign currencies, and curbs on sending money abroad.GDP growth is likely to be depressed over the longer term, as Russia is cut off from Western technology, it adds.

The UK say the move will further target “the lavish lifestyles of the Kremlin’s inner circle”. My colleague Rupert Neate wrote about Tikhonova and Vorontsova earlier this week: Putin’s elder daughter, Maria Vorontsova, 36, is a paediatric endocrinologist, studying the effects of hormones on the body. The move reverses some of the doubling of interest rates last month, when the Ukraine war triggered the first wave of sanctions on Russia and sent the rouble plunging. Explaining the move, which comes in on Monday, the Bank of Russsia said inflation pressures have eased as the rouble has partially recovered, and financial stability risks have stabilised, but are still present. It also warns that Russia’s economic activity is still being “considerably” constrained by external conditions. Data this week showed that Russia’s service sector contracted rapidly last month, with economists predicting a steep recession this year. The Bank of Russia adds that it could cut interest rates again at future meetings:  He said there was a shortage of fuel for farmers but Ukraine knew how to keep them supplied. He also said Ukraine had large stocks of grain, cereals and vegetable oil, and could feed its population (via Reuters).World food prices jumped to new record high in March as the war in Ukraine rattled drove up prices, adding to the inflation pressures on people around the globe. Vegetable oils, cereals and meat all hit record highs, while sugar and dairy products prices also rose significantly. The Food and Agriculture Organization says its food price index, which tracks the most globally traded food commodities, made “a giant leap” in March, to 159.3 points from 141.4 for February. The AA estimates that more than 27.6 million car journeys are planned between Good Friday and Easter Monday (between 15th and 18th April). Some 13.6 million are expected on Good Friday alone, leading to fears of tailbacks on popular tourist routes. The boss of Manchester Airport’s owner has admitted the airport does not have enough staff, and warned that the long queues at the airport could persist for months. Charlie Cornish, chief executive of Manchester Airports Group, has written an open letter to passengers, in which he apologises for the disruption, and explains that the the airport hasn’t been able to hire staff fast enough. Cornish explains that the airport has interviewed 4,000 staff in the last two months, and expects around 250 new security staff to start in the operation by early May. Staff with the right level of security clearance are also being deployed to help. Cornish advises passengers to arrive at the airport three hours before their flight leaves, to allow enough time to check-in, get through security and reach the departure gate.  He says the airport doesn’t want to cap capacity and force airlines to cancel flights, as this would cause “enormous disruption to holidays, business trips and long-awaited visits to see friends and family.” The managing director of Manchester airport quit earlier this week after rising criticism over chaos that saw thousands of passengers missed their flights because of queues up to seven hours long. Deputy CEO Ken O’Toole has the BBC the chaotic scenes last weekend were an “isolated incident”. But O’Toole insists people would prefer to queue than see their flight cancelled. Those queues have been exceptionally long, though, with some passengers enduring waits of up to eight hours in terminal buildings before they could check in. Meanwhile, tailbacks on the major roads to the Channel are expected to intensify, as Eurotunnel anticipates rising traffic in both directions and P\u0026ampO Ferries services remain suspended. Passengers booked with P\u0026ampO on the Dover-Calais route have been told they cannot travel this weekend, as the rival operator DFDS, which had been accommodating P\u0026ampO customers, is now fully booked. Airports are redeploying office staff with security clearance to frontline roles where possible to help mitigate the chaotic scenes of recent days, particularly at Manchester airport. EasyJet, which has had to axe hundreds of flights this week, said it would be pre-emptively cancelling a further 50 flights a day over the weekend to minimise disruption. Large numbers of crew remain sick with Covid, affecting services at Gatwick, Luton and Manchester. However, the airline said it would still be operating more flights than at any point since 2019 – about 1,600 a day, 300 more than in August 2021. UK airlines and airports have been warned about the levels of disruption being by passengers, as people head abroad in the run-up to Easter, some of them for the first time since the pandemic began. After days of long queues, cancellations and chaotic scenes at airports, the aviation regulator has warned travel firms to stop cancelling flights at the last minute and promptly pay compensation to disrupted passengers. Civil Aviation Authority chief executive Richard Moriarty has written to airlines and airports, saying: The CAA’sa warning comes as airlines and cross-Channel services brace for their busiest weekend since the start of the pandemic, with outbound and returning holidaymakers set to swell numbers at ports that are already struggling to cope with surging demand. Airports and airlines have blamed recruitment problems, and illness from Covid-19, for leaving them short-staffed. Having cut staff once the pandemic began, the industry is trying to meet renewed demand for travel after the UK lifted the last testing restrictions on 18 March. Moriarty, though, says recruitment should have been faster, and insists the travel sector sets “deliverable” schedules: It is “very important” that airlines are setting schedules “on a basis that is deliverable given available staff (including contractors), and has resilience for staff sickness, including from Covid,” Mr Moriarty added. Hundreds of flights have been cancelled in recent days, with British Airways cancelling another 74 flights on Thursday and easyJet 52. There’s also disruption in Kent, where an eastward section of the M20 was shut this week for thousands of lorries to park, due to delays at the port of Dover. In the energy markets, the Brent crude oil price is hovering around $100 per barrel after members of the International Energy Agency agreed to release another 60 million barrels of oil from their emergency stocks yesterday, amid a shortage exacerbated by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

We have to lift ourselves and sometimes a game coming quickly is a good thing for that. Asked about speculation over his position, Lampard replied: “In my relatively short managerial career, I’m used to that – I probably spent 18 months at Chelsea with the same, always two or three games from the sack. I’ve got no problem with that here, we’re a huge club. But in football terms we’ve got no right not to be fighting a battle with relegation, regardless of our history. Lampard added that Seamus Coleman is now in contention to feature against Manchester United, Fabian Delph is in the squad, while Jerry Mina would hopefully be ready to return against Leicester on 20 April. Team new-wise, Rangnick will have Cristiano Ronaldo available again but several others are still out. Luke Shaw is expected to be sidelined for two to three weeks as he has an operation to remove metal bolts from his leg, while Edinson Cavani, Raphael Varane and Scott McTominay are still injured.“When he is here you can ask him and he’ll give a better answer.

There are negotiations that need to serve all parties to reach an agreement.”Sunday sees Leicester v Crystal Palace, a battle between two teams close together in the table who will feel very differently about how the season has gone. Brentford v West Ham could be the latest instalment of the Christian Eriksen fairytale. Norwich v Burnley could see Burnley climb out of the bottom three for the first time since August if Everton have already slipped up. And then to the Etihad and Manchester City v Liverpool it is.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIn a position paper on Irish neutrality, Barry Andrews also called for Ireland to join a common EU defence arrangement where Irish troops would come to the aid of other member states if they come under attack.However, Ireland should remain out of Nato, he said. “While Ireland should fight to protect the European Union, it should not interfere with sovereign countries in the way that Nato has done in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. Therefore, I call on the Government to emphatically reject any possibility of joining Nato.”A citizens’ assembly on the issue of neutrality should also be held. Mr Andrews told The  this should be followed by a referendum on the issue.“The subjects of defence and security have been taboo for too long in Ireland,” and Ireland’s “partial neurosis” on the subject have left it unable to defend itself, the position paper states.“The last few weeks have shown the need for a comprehensive, depoliticised debate among citizens, politicians, Defence Forces personnel and academic experts. Ireland has developed an internationally recognised model for untangling difficult public policy issues through participative democracy.”Mr Andrews said the document was created to stimulate debate on the subject of neutrality and defence.In calling for abolition of the triple-lock, Mr Andrews was echoing calls from Tánaiste Leo Varadkar. Mr Varadkar told a meeting of the Fine Gael parliamentary party last month that Fine Gael should adopt the position to distinguish itself from Fianna Fáil.The triple-lock requires a UN General Assembly or Security Council resolution, along with both Government and Dáil approval before more than 12 Irish troops can be deployed overseas.It means the permanent members of the Security Council, including Russia and China, have an effective veto on the deployment of Irish troops.“We must give ourselves the flexibility to deploy our peacekeepers wherever we want, whenever we want,” Mr Andrews wrote. He called on the Government to replace the requirement for a UN resolution with a requirement for a decision of the European Council. He said Ireland should “affirm its commitment” to any EU member which is the victim of aggression. This would mean the deployment of Defence Forces troops in the field, but only after the military is properly funded and equipped, he said.However any EU common defence arrangement should be limited to conventional, hybrid and cyber attacks. French nuclear weapons should not be included in the arrangement “under any circumstances” and it should be limited solely to EU territory.These policies should be underpinned by greater funding for the Defence Forces as per the recommendations of the Commission on the Defence Forces which reported earlier this year.Mr Andrews called Ireland’s defence funding, which is 0.3 per cent of GDP, “virtually negligent”. He noted Finland, another neutral country, has just announced a 70 per cent increase in its defence spending.However “in the current climate” Ireland should refrain from committing to the most ambitious spending proposals contained in the commission’s report, including the purchase of jet fighters, he said.Ireland should also take a greater role in the EU’s Permanent Structured Co-operation (Pesco), which sets out military development goals for member states to work towards.

Photograph: EPAAndy RainA British government minister has accepted that “further dialogue” is required with the Irish government over a controversial US-style visa waiver for non-Irish EU citizens crossing the Border as part of proposed changes to immigration laws.During a debate in the House of Lords on Monday prior to a vote, the planned pre-travel clearance checks for those entering Northern Ireland were branded “unworkable”, with members urging the UK Lords Minister, Susan Williams (Baroness Williams of Trafford) to “make concessions”.Responding to criticism about lack of communication with the Irish Government and tourist chiefs, she said: “We do accept the need for further dialogue with interlocuters including the Irish government, Tourism Ireland and Tourism Northern Ireland. I totally accept that point.”Last Tuesday, Westminster MPs voted to reinstate the proposal for an electronic waiver following an amendment by the House of Lords to exempt Northern Ireland from the new legislation. The day after the Commons challenge, the Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said as far as he was concerned, it had not been finalised. He described the decision as “regrettable”.Coming under the British government’s Nationalities and Borders Bill, the proposal will require EU citizens who are not Irish will to apply online for pre-travel clearance -known as Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) - before entering the UK, including when crossing the Border into the North.Addressing the Lords on Monday after submitting an amendment, Paul Murphy (Baron Murphy of Torfaen) said he was “hopeful the Minister would have spoken to her colleagues in the Northern Ireland Office and would have made some concessions on this”. “But the dead hand of the Home Office is there again,” he added.The former Northern Ireland Secretary of State said he was “troubled” by the introduction of an ETA, at a cost of €14, saying it would severely impact on tourism, cross-border health services and the “spirit of the Good Friday Agreement” .“Is it really worth jeopardising our (BritishIrish) relationship which is bad enough as it is over the last number of years by this petty and silly proposal by the government...I hope the government will change its mind but I’m not hopeful.”The planned change to the law will also apply to citizens of the European Economic Area (EEA) living in the State, which includes people from Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland.Non-British or non-Irish citizens from other countries, outside the EUEEA, which previously did not require a visa to enter the UK, will now need an ETA.Former SDLP leader Margaret Richie also expressed her opposition, saying the ETA scheme was “unworkable”.“It is unenforceable and would violate the very premise of reconciliation in terms of the Good Friday Agreement,” she told the Lords.She asked the UK minister to “consider the geography” of Border towns and villages, saying: “I believe the Home Office hasn’t fully considered that.” “There’s one village that straddles both Donegal and Fermanagh, that is the small village of Pettigo where that Border goes straight down the middle.“Within one minute you could be in the Republic of Ireland and the next minute, you could be in Northern Ireland.” She queried what discussions had taken with the Irish Government as well tourism organisations.The human rights NGO, the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ), has also condemned the move, which it said was “unworkable and risks a hard border for many non-British and non-Irish citizens in Border communities who have been able to freely cross the Border to date”.Baroness Williams — who described herself as “an Irish woman with a father from Northern Ireland” — indicated however that the ETA plan was likely to be passed. “Once the EU’s come into force next year, Ireland will stand out as one of the few countries in Europe without an ETA style pass,” she said.Referring to tourism, she said that “once granted, an ETA will be valid for multiple trips to the UK”, and that the cost is “likely to be small and unlikely to be a deterrent for visitors”.“Moreover, many of the UK’s international partners have taken a similar approach to border security...It is a very familiar concept for travellers,” she added."},{"url":null,"title":"martin describes russia s expulsion of irish diplomats as unjustified","story":" Protestors against the invasion of Ukraine  at the Russian embassy in  Dublin. Photograph: Colin KeeganCollins DublinThe expulsion of two Irish diplomats from the embassy in Moscow has been described as “completely unjustified” by Taoiseach Micheál Martin.The Irish ambassador to Russia, Brian McElduff, was summoned to the Russian foreign ministry in Moscow on Thursday afternoon and told two diplomats had been asked to leave.“It is completely unjustified. The two people concerned are diplomats, engaged in nothing other than diplomatic activities. We did expel four senior members of the Russian team for behaviour not compatible with diplomatic activities and contrary to diplomatic norms,” said Mr Martin, who is in Helsinki in Finland meeting president Sauli Niinistö and Finnish prime minister Sanna Marin.In a statement, the Russian embassy in Dublin said Moscow would respond “proportionally to any hostile steps” from the Government, which it said had been following a “destructive line towards Russia”. The expulsion of the two Irish diplomats were “appropriate reciprocal measures” to the “unfriendly and groundless” decision by Ireland to expel four Russian diplomats from the embassy on Orwell Road last week, it said. The Russian ministry of foreign affairs called on Irish authorities “to immediately remove any obstacles to the work of the Embassy of Russia in Dublin and ensure normal conditions for the functioning of the Russian diplomatic mission,” the statement said. Earlier this wee, it was reported that the Russian embassy had appealed to the Government for help as it faced a fuel shortage, due to Irish oil companies refusing to deliver supplies to the Dublin property.In Helsinki, Mr Martin said that on the issue of neutrality, Ireland must play to its strengths.“Nothing in Ireland’s position on military neutrality in any way impedes the EU response. We are not a strong military country, so we want to play to our strengths where we can be most effective in terms of our contribution. We will reflect on these issues later. For now we want to maintain our strong unity of purpose.”Speaking after his meeting with Ms Marin, Mr Martin said the two discussed the implications for security arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine.“While Ireland is a militarily neutral country we are not politically or morally neutral in the face of these war crimes and opposition.” Security situationMs Marin said the Russian invasion had fundamentally changed the security situation in Finland. Russia and Finland are separated by a 1,340km-long border.She said more must be done to weaken Russia’s ability to finance war.“We want to help in any way we can. We are in this situation with Ukraine and we all have to help Ukraine to win the war. And I think it is not a question of if they win the war, it is when they will win. In our hearts Ukrainians have already won the war,” Ms Marin said.Asked if Finland would join Nato, she said there would be discussions in the coming weeks in the Finnish parliament. Earlier, speaking after his meeting with Mr Niinistö, Mr Martin said they had a “very broad discussion in terms of the international situation, particularly the war on Ukraine, the degree to which the multilateral order has been turned upside down the sheer of barbaric nature of the attack on Ukrainian civilians, and the implications for the security architecture of Europe well into the future and the capacity of open economies like Ireland and Finland that are very alike.”Full coverage of the Russian invasion of Ukraine"},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach calls for pause ahead of report on holohan secondment","story":"Dr Tony Holohan announced last month he was stepping down from his position as chief medical officer to take on the new role at Trinity College Dublin. Photograph: The Taoiseach Micheál Martin has called for a “pause” and “reassessment” around the planned secondment of Dr Tony Holohan to Trinity College before the Government receives a report on the process next week.Speaking in Helsinki, Mr Martin said there must be transparency around the move.Dr Holohan was announced as the professor of public health strategy and leadership at Trinity on March 25th, a role which will involve learning the lessons of Covid and preparing for future health challenges.The appointment sparked controversy this week when it emerged in recent days that the Department of Health would fund the role and continue to pay Dr Holohan’s annual salary of €187,000.A private meeting of the Oireachtas Committee on Health on Thursday heard that Department of Health secretary general Robert Watt signed off on the secondment.“I’ve asked the Minister for Health for the full report on the entire process that led up to this appointment and the Minister has asked the secretary general of the Department of Health for that report,” said the Taoiseach.“There seems to be have been a number of strands to this, in respect of a research strand. We all understand the merit in creating additional capacity to create a research platform around pandemic preparedness, given the experiences that we’ve had over the last two years.“In officialdom that would be one perspective, but there is a research perspective to this, there is a more medium term perspective to this. And in my view, there should be a pause, there be a reassessment as to how the objectives that are behind this can be realised in a better and more transparent way. The report will come in a number of days.”Tánaiste Leo Varadkar on Friday said he had “assumed” Dr Holohan had applied for the Trinity role after a position came up, but that it now appeared “more complicated than that”.The nature of how the appointment was made “could have been better handled quite frankly,” he said. The Fine Gael leader said he expected the report into the matter would only take a number of days, and would be finished next week.“Because it does involve taxpayers’ money we think it’s appropriate that the appointment should be paused for a short period while we can find out exactly how it came about, and assure ourselves that procedures were correctly followed,” he said.Mr Varadkar said “there may not have been” a need for Dr Holohan to move into the academic position on secondment from the Department of Health, which was one aspect the review would examine.“Nobody in Government is happy about this because even though we were not involved in it in any way, inevitably these things do reflect on us,” he said.Mr Varadkar said the secondment of Dr Holohan was a “very different situation” to the previous controversial - and later abandoned – proposed appointment of former minister Katherine Zappone to a UN special envoy role.“That was a ministerial appointment in which Ministers were involved, this is not, this is a public appointment involving public and civil servants in which Ministers are not involved,” he added.Meanwhile, Sinn Féin health spokesman, David Cullinane, said Mr Watt should clarify his role in the process rather than be involved in producing a report on the matter requested by Government.“I think we need an examination from others, other than the people involved in the process, and that’s always the best way to establish the facts,” he told The . “Robert Watt needs to clarify was he part of these disusssions and did he sign off on it, and if he did, it would be better for someone else to do the examination.”In a statement on Thursday, the department said that “all arrangements in relation to staffing are the responsiblity of the Secretary General”.CommitteeEarlier on Fridauy, the chair of the Oireachtas Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform John McGuinness said that Mr Watt and Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform Michael McGrath will be asked before the committee to answer questions on the secondment of Dr Holohan.Mr McGuinness spoke of his “serious concerns” about how the secondment of Dr Holohan to Trinity College Dublin was handled by Mr Watt.“It is quite a mess within the department. It shows a certain dysfunction within the department and we need to clarify it,” Mr McGuinness told RTÉ Radio’s Morning Ireland programme.“I have serious concerns about how the department reached the decision in relation to all of this and also the fact that the Minister (for Health) was not informed. Minister McGrath was not informed.“There is still a lot of questions as to how this position was created was funded. Why there was so much secrecy around it. Why the department refused to answer questions from the very beginning.”Mr McGuinness said that every secretary general has a responsibility to appear before Oireachtas committees.“Mr Watt will be asked after the Easter recess but during the recess we will be making arrangements for that to happen. And Minister McGrath will also be asked before the committee. And indeed if the Minister of Health had a role in this well we will need to know what that is too.“But this cannot continue in terms of the management of any department. The Minister must be informed and there are certain guidelines and so on that need to be followed relative to appointments like this.”Earlier this week Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly described Dr Holohan’s new role as a “really positive move”, which he fully supports."},{"url":null,"title":"eu leaders arrive in kyiv to reassure zelenskiy on membership bid","story":"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen addresses a joint press conference with Sweden’s Prime Minister in Stockholm, Sweden, on April 7th, 2022. Photograph: Stefan Jerrevang TT News Agency AFP via Getty ImagesThe European Commission chief and the EU’s top diplomat arrived in Kyiv on Friday to offer Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy support and reassurance over his bid for EU membership in a capital gradually reviving after Russia pulled back forces.Travelling by train from Brussels to Kyiv, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen told reporters the most important message she was bringing to Zelenskiy was that there “will be the EU path” for Ukraine.“Usually it takes years before the EU council accepts application for membership but Ukraine did that in a week or two and I ask to move forward as soon as possible,” she said. “Our goal is present Ukraine application to council this summer.”Six weeks into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, she pledged her support for Kyiv to “emerge from the war as a democratic country”, something, she said, the European Union and other donors would help with.It was a message echoed by Josep Borrell, the EU’s chief diplomat, who also told reporters the visit was a signal that “Ukraine is in control of its territory” and the government was still in charge.“Ukraine is not a country invaded, dominated. There is still a government (which) receives people from outside and you can travel to Kyiv,” Mr Borrell said, adding he hoped the EU would offer another €500 million to Kyiv in the coming days.He also said the trip would allow the bloc to outline the measures the EU has taken to “isolate Russia” over its invasion of Ukraine, a war Moscow describes as a “special operation” to “denazify” its neighbour.Mr Zelenskiy rejects Moscow’s assertion, and says the war raging in parts of his country for the last six weeks is a direct attack on not only Ukraine’s existence, but also on the security of Europe as a whole.As the EU leaders were poised to arrive, more than 30 people were killed and more than 100 wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a railway station in east Ukraine as civilians tried to evacuate to safer areas, the state railway company said.Moscow’s incursion has seen more than 4 million people flee abroad, killed or wounded thousands and reduced cities to rubble though Russian forces have failed to take any major cities.Mr Zelenskiy has urged Brussels to do more to punish Russia, including banning purchases of oil and gas from the country, and has called on the EU to accept Ukraine as a full member.Mr Borrell said oil sanctions were “a big elephant in the room”, with some concerns that a move to cut out Russian crude could cause a spike in prices painful to European economies. He said a decision on exports would be raised on Monday in Brussels.Mr Borrell and Ms von der Leyen are the latest Western leaders to visit Kyiv after the prime ministers of Poland, Slovenia and the Czech Republic travelled to meet Zelenskiy last month. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"european parliament backs rule change to ensure flow of medicines to northern ireland","story":"The European Parliament has voted by an overwhelming majority to approve an EU rule change to ensure medicines can continue to flow into Northern Ireland seamlessly from Britain. File photograph: PA WireThe European Parliament has voted by an overwhelming majority to approve an EU rule change to ensure medicines can continue to flow into Northern Ireland seamlessly from Britain under post-Brexit arrangements, in a step pushed for by Irish MEPs.The derogation for Northern Ireland approved by the parliament exempts it indefinitely from requirements on medicines that usually apply within the single market, to avoid any interruption to supply in this regard for the North.It applies to both approved and experimental drugs, and will apply retrospectively from the start of this year when it comes into force imminently.Under the Northern Ireland protocol, part of the EU-UK Brexit withdrawal agreement that guarantees a special post-Brexit trading status for the region, the North is still part of the EU regulatory market for medicines, even though a large proportion of its medicines are supplied from Britain. Irish MEPs and diplomats had lobbied for the rule change to be approved and the step was welcomed.“That means important medicinal products will get to the people who need them and provides greater certainty for Northern Ireland post-Brexit, which is very welcome news indeed.”“Of the issues that bother people about the protocol, the main one is medicines,” he said. “It was a very clear message at a very sensitive time in Northern Irish politics, and I hope the message is really well received in Northern Ireland.”ConsequencesThe change to EU rules, first proposed by the European Commission in December, means that marketing authorisation holders for medicines for Northern Ireland can be located anywhere in the UK, and batch-testing can also take place in Britain.Experimental drugs manufactured in Britain can also be imported into Northern Ireland, as well as into the Republic, Cyprus, and Malta, as long as they meet conditions.The derogation for the Republic, Cyprus, and Malta is for a temporary period of three years.If medicines are given authorisation in the UK before they receive it from the European Medicines Agency, they can still be supplied to Northern Ireland under the rule change, which allows for temporary authorisations in such circumstances.The commission is set to propose a broader revision of EU pharmaceutical rules by the end of this year, which is expected to set out more permanent structural solutions to ensure the security of supply of medicines in general in smaller markets, according to a statement by the European Parliament.

Although it might be horrifying to modern minds, perhaps the CLC could begin by reflecting that, in Roman society, slaves effectively had the status of a tool. They were bought for a purpose – everything from, worst of all, working down the mines, to doctors, architects, jewellers or professors, who were purchased at great expense and expected to use their skills to the household’s advantage.And then there were the masters. There were those who understood about human relationships and how to get the best out of people. Uniquely in the ancient world, Roman slaves who did good service to their masters stood the chance of being freed. In that case they and their children would become citizens (and at once buy slaves themselves). There are thousands of monuments and inscriptions set up by such “freedmen”, announcing their pride in their achievements.Equally there were very bad masters. Life for their slaves would have been intolerable. And since one can assume that this is the picture CLC wishes to paint, for fear that innocent children will otherwise come away with the impression the slavery was wonderful, this raises a problem. How are they going to turn Caecilius, the male “lead” of the course, currently a good master, into a bad master?The point here is that we live in a world of trigger warnings, and the trigger warnings that the ancient world sets off will probably burst our sensitive pupils’ ear drums. For starters, the ancients had no concept of human rights. They had no belief even in the right to life.In such a situation, the treatment which bad masters meted out to their slaves is not fit for human consumption by anyone of any age, let alone under 16. Male and female slaves could be raped at will by the master and his sons, hired out as prostitutes, sold off to fight to the death as gladiators, or for almost any other purpose that human wickedness could devise.The CLC is right to want its pupils to have as accurate a picture of the Roman world as possible. But good luck to them on achieving that end on a subject as complex and, if we are to believe what we are told about the young, as traumatising as slavery.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Rishi Sunak may have broken ministerial codeRussia-Ukraine latest news: Dozens feared dead in rocket strike on Kramatorsk railway station Boris Becker found guilty on four counts under Insolvency ActRussian missile that struck Kramatorsk train station daubed with \u0026#39for the children\u0026#39Watch: US fighter in Ukraine issues \u0026#39plea for help\u0026#39 for more weapons to combat RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"angela merkel doesnt deserve quiet retirement","story":"She was hailed as the world’s most powerful woman, the de facto leader of Europe and, for a while, of the free world. For 16 years Angela Merkel’s popularity in her native Germany never fell below 50 per cent. For those who put their faith in the EU, she could do no wrong.Then, when Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine, her reputation collapsed. Now her legacy lies in ruins. It is rather difficult to find a Western politician whose status has fallen off a cliff quite like Merkel’s. Ukrainians blame her for appeasing Putin and leaving them at his mercy. They recall the 2008 Bucharest summit, when George W. Bush wanted to offer Ukraine Nato membership but the Germans and French vetoed it.As the full horror of the Russian occupation emerged, Volodymyr Zelensky could not contain his wrath: “I invite Mrs Merkel and Mr Sarkozy to visit Bucha, to see what the policy of 14 years of concessions has led to. The Ukrainian president called on her and the former French president “to see with their own eyes the tortured Ukrainian men and women”.Even now, Angela Merkel apparently has no regrets. Her office issued a terse statement: “Former German Chancellor Dr Angela Merkel stands by her decisions in connection with the 2008 Nato summit in Bucharest.” She refuses to apologise, then, for any of the policies that have led Germany and Europe to catastrophe. Instead, Mrs Merkel is writing her memoirs, convinced that history will somehow vindicate her. Once it was fashionable to compare her with Margaret Thatcher. Yet her approach was the opposite of the Iron Lady’s. Where Mrs Thatcher stood up to tyrants, Mrs Merkel sought to accommodate them, in the naive belief that prosperity would rid Russia and China of their authoritarian regimes. Germans used to call her Mutti (“Mummy”). Not any more. Mrs Merkel is the kind of mother who, when her child is bullied and beaten up at school, refuses to confront the teachers and instead blames the victim.Her admirers used to boast that she enjoyed a uniquely honest relationship with Putin, because she could talk frankly to the Russian dictator in his own language. Yet the truth is that Mrs Merkel, the former East German, feared the former KGB thug – and he smelled her fear. In later years, they spoke only in German, enabling Putin to hold the whip hand.From the outset, there was something sadomasochistic about their relationship. When she was his guest in 2007, Putin brought his pet labrador Connie to one of their meetings, knowing that she was nervous of dogs. Yet she played along with his blatant misogyny and fell into all the geopolitical traps he had laid for her.The biggest of these traps was her decision to allow Germany to become ever more dependent on Russian energy. By the time she left office last year, Germany was importing 55 per cent of its gas, 34 per cent of its oil and 52 per cent of its coal from Russia. Her short-termist, opportunistic exit from nuclear power compounded this. Worst of all was Mrs Merkel’s stubborn support for the deeply sinister Nordstream gas pipeline project, which flew in the face of Anglo-American warnings and desperate pleas from Ukraine. She turned a blind eye to the fact that Nordstream’s chairman – her predecessor as Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder – was being bankrolled by Russian energy. Nordstream had all the hallmarks of political interference, but she insisted that it was purely commercial.Mrs Merkel is no less culpable for her failure to maintain German defences. On her watch, in the words of the Bundeswehr’s most senior general, they were “stripped bare”. She allowed German firms to sell “dual use” military equipment to Russia, but banned arms exports to Ukraine.After Putin annexed Crimea and sent his “little green men” into Ukraine’s Donbas region, the writing was on the wall. Yet Mrs Merkel persisted in “building bridges” to Russia right up to the day she left office last December. Her most senior colleagues, such as the former finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble and the former foreign minister, now President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, have admitted that it was a fatal mistake to trust the Russian president. “Today I know — I was wrong,” Schäuble says. “We were all wrong.”Not Mrs Merkel, though. She, the chief architect of the European policies that gave Putin the green light to inflict war crimes on Ukraine, has yet to show any hint of contrition. It is high time that Angela Merkel said sorry to Ukraine, Europe and the free world. She owes us all an apology.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Dozens feared dead in rocket strike on Kramatorsk railway station Boris Becker found guilty on four counts under Insolvency ActRussian missile that struck Kramatorsk train station daubed with \u0026#39for the children\u0026#39Politics latest news: Rishi Sunak may have broken ministerial codeWatch: US fighter in Ukraine issues \u0026#39plea for help\u0026#39 for more weapons to combat RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"brooklyn beckhams vogue wedding match made brand heaven","story":"If an image can be said to sum up a decade, it’s as good as anything the 1990s threw up: David and Victoria Beckham, walking hand in hand at their wedding reception at Dublin’s Luttrellstown Castle on July 4 1999, wearing outfits of matching Milk Tray purple.David, then 24 and at the peak of his footballing powers, has his hair streaked blond. Victoria, then 25 and a little past the peak of her first career as a Spice Girl, has a butternut-squash tan and pixie cut.Her look is accented by a rose corsage wider than her head. His look is accented by a diamante crucifix necklace, designer stubble and – squint-and-you’ll-miss-him – their four-month-old son, Brooklyn, whose outfit is cut from the same lurid cloth as his parents’, right down to his tiny cowboy hat.“THE WEDDING OF THE DECADE”, cried the next issue of OK! magazine, which had exclusive rights to the build-up, the day and the aftermath of the nuptials, on the cover of its biggest ever issue.And, with insincere apologies to Prince Edward, it really was the wedding of the decade. Everything – from the dove released when the pair said “I do” to the Robin Hood theme, scattered rose petals, and Victoria’s silk, pleated Vera Wang gown with sculpted neckline and 20ft train – made it exquisitely, exclusively 90s.“We did throw a lot at it,” recalled David on Desert Island Discs in 2017. He lamented the evening dress code – “I even had a top hat in purple... what was I thinking?” – but seemed to concede that it was all a long, long time ago.Twenty-three years, to be exact – a period in which we’ve watched Brand Beckham move on, grow up, spawn and ersify with remarkable savvy. And this weekend, its next move ought to make that evolution plain, as well as make us feel utterly ancient.It’s time for Brooklyn to lead a transatlantic merger. The joining of two houses, both alike in prosperity. Yes, the baby in the cowboy hat has lassoed a bride of his own: in a new decade, the Beckham wedding is back, and this time it’s high-end. Or, sort of high-end, anyway.A few basic details, so everyone’s up to speed: the bride-to-be is Nicola Peltz, a 27-year-old actress whom 23-year-old Brooklyn met at Coachella music festival and started dating in 2019, then proposed to with a £250,000 diamond ring 10 months later. She was wearing a Victoria Beckham dress that day. “I fall in love with you more every day,” Brooklyn wrote, on Instagram. And that was almost two years ago, meaning he must be super keen on her now.Peltz has appeared in Transformers: Age of Extinction, the Psycho prequel Bates Motel and several music videos, but she’s also, helpfully, an heiress. Her parents are US businessman Nelson Peltz, who has an estimated fortune of more than £1.3 billion, and his third wife, former model Claudia Heffner Peltz. The poor Beckhams only have £380 million. (A prenuptial agreement has allegedly been signed.)The merger will occur tomorrow, at the Peltz family’s $76 million, 44,000 sq ft, 27-bedroom, oceanfront house in Palm Beach, Florida, after some 300 guests have enjoyed a welcome dinner this evening, and before a relaxed farewell event on Sunday.It is, friends say, “Miami society meets British celebrity”, which means that if you can think of a famous person who might be there, they probably will be. Family friends likely to attend include Gordon Ramsay, Phil Neville, Eva Longoria, the other Spice Girls and, possibly, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. One of Brooklyn’s godfathers, Sir Elton John, is on tour.Then there are the couple’s friends, many of whom are the offspring of celebrities, like Rocco Ritchie (Guy Ritchie and Madonna’s son), Anaïs Gallagher (daughter of Noel) and Nicole Ritchie (daughter of Lionel). And, of course, family, who fill all the major roles: Romeo and Cruz, Brooklyn’s younger brothers, will act as best men, while their sister, Harper, will be a bridesmaid. Nicola’s maid-of-honour is her maternal grandmother, and her “man-of-honour” is one of her brothers, Brad. She has six (one, Will, is an actor), and one sister. Her father-in-law, David, the famous wit, will be master of ceremonies.Aside from being costly (£3 million, they say) and containing an overexcited Mel B, Brooklyn’s wedding has little in common with that of his parents. No doves, thrones or matching violet evening outfits are expected.For one thing, it’ll be Jewish. Despite neither bride nor groom being Jewish, it’s been reported that tomorrow’s ceremony will include glass-breaking, a yarmulke, a chuppah, a Hebrew blessing and even the signing of a ketubah. Nicola’s father is said to be a devout Jew, and Brooklyn’s great-grandfather (David’s maternal grandfather) was, too. That quite tenuous connection allegedly bonded the happy couple.Snoop Dogg, a friend of David’s and former neighbour from the Beckhams’ time in Los Angeles, will DJ at the Covid-secure reception. The bride will wear Valentino the groom will probably wear something that looks as if it was lent to him by the Peaky Blinders costume department, as he usually does.As for the Covid-tested guests, they’d better wear something very chic and very classy if they want to have a chance of having a photographic memory of the day. They’ll be banned from taking their own photos, because Vogue has the rights to exclusive imagery and coverage.Yes, Vogue. In 1999, OK! magazine reported exclusively on everything from Posh’s dress fitting (“Victoria’s Secrets: Why I want to be sexy and virginal  My tattoo surprise for David!”) to printing the speeches in full. Twenty-three years later, the fact their cowbaby has been able to sell his own wedding rights to the fashion bible instead is perhaps the clearest sign of how Brand Beckham has changed. How Vogue has changed, too.That first wedding was very much the marriage of two young people who grew up only hoping to be rich and famous – for a long time, they were just David from Chingford and Victoria from Hertfordshire. Brooklyn and Nicola, on the other hand, grew up knowing they’d never have to work a day in their lives if they didn’t want to.Theirs is as much a society wedding as a minor royal’s, then, especially given the Peltzes’ fortune. Nelson, who is 79, never graduated from university and ended up as a delivery driver for the family food distribution business. A decade and a half later, he’d grown it into a $150 million business.As a financier, Nelson went on to snaffle the soft drink Snapple from Quaker Oats, turning its fortunes around so swiftly that Cadbury Schweppes bought it in 2000. He is seen as a doyen of the food retail and distribution industries, working with Heinz and PepsiCo, among others, which has meant he’s made a lot of powerful friends.One was Donald Trump: in February 2020, Nelson hosted a fundraiser for the then-president at the same venue as tomorrow’s wedding. He withdrew his public support after the Capitol insurrection a year later.What a meeting of brands this is. In merging with the Peltzes, the Beckhams consolidate their wealth and power, probe further into US society, and gain access not only to that Florida mansion but the family’s other, 130-acre home in New York, where there is an ice rink and flock of albino peacocks.In merging with the Beckhams, the Peltzes join forces with one of the world’s most famous families, who established themselves in the US years ago, and have built themselves over the years from “footballer and pop star” to a classy but accessible level of quasi-royalty.But that’s the cynical view. The happy couple seem as in love as any bride and groom. Just hunt down their gushing Instagram tributes, tattoos and cutesy online cookery videos for evidence. Expect all that to be present this weekend. Brand Beckham has come a long way since “the wedding of the decade” – now prepare for them to define another era of celebrity.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Dozens feared dead in rocket strike on Kramatorsk railway station Boris Becker found guilty on four counts under Insolvency ActRussian missile that struck Kramatorsk train station daubed with \u0026#39for the children\u0026#39Politics latest news: Rishi Sunak may have broken ministerial codeWatch: US fighter in Ukraine issues \u0026#39plea for help\u0026#39 for more weapons to combat RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"defence non doms","story":"In politics, like sports, momentum matters. The same blow one might shrug off if the fight is going your way can floor you if it isn\u0027t. So it was with Boris Johnson, who shrugged off innumerable embarrassments before they started to stick after the Owen Paterson fiasco and Partygate revelations. And so it is now for Rishi Sunak, who is under scrutiny for his wife\u0027s tax affairs. The truth is that Akshata Murty\u0027s tax status would have been obvious at any time to anyone who had paid. She is a citizen of India worth hundreds of millions of pounds. Of course she would take advantage of a status designed for wealthy foreigners. But what is a passing detail when you\u0027re hosing the electorate with public money during a pandemic is a looming iceberg when you\u0027re set to preside over a cost-of-living crisis.That the Chancellor didn\u0027t foresee this is yet more evidence that his political instincts may not be all they were once thought to be. But that doesn\u0027t mean that all the criticism levelled at him is proportionate or well-founded. Suggestions he resign for reportedly acquiring a US green card, for example, sit uncomfortably alongside the fact that Boris Johnson served as Foreign Secretary whilst holding an American passport.In fact, one doesn\u0027t even need to be a British citizen to stand for Parliament. Irish or Commonwealth citizens (including Murty) can do so on their original passports. This remarkably open approach is a product of Britain\u0027s historic circumstances. And, whatever you may think of that, it is clear Sunak\u0027s conduct is not out of keeping with it.Sunak\u0027s Conservative opponents ought to see the dangers turning against non-domiciled status. They should remember that the real non-dom regime, rather than the one that exists in the heads of left-wing activists, is broadly a good thing for Britain. By avoiding double taxation on money earned and spent overseas, which would be morally iniquitous in any event, it encourages wealthy people to take up residence here, bringing a share of their wealth with them. They still pay tax on money in this country just the same as everyone else. This includes not only tax receipts but investment and other spending, as well as growth and jobs if they establish businesses here. It is a system which has helped establish Britain as a hub for global wealth.  One might therefore expect pro-capitalists to defend Mrs Murty\u0027s right to be a non-dom. Indeed, much of the opposition to the status is predicated on the socialist belief that billionaires shouldn\u0027t exist in the first place, and this conversation will only feed into the hands of Left-wing politicians, whose anti-business policies will undoubtedly gain legitimacy out of it. Conservative MPs are well within their rights to conclude that the current media storm, following on from the Spring Statement, is evidence sufficient that Sunak should never lead their party. But they should be careful not to indulge anti-wealth narratives. Such an approach would ultimately catch up with them. More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Dozens feared dead in rocket strike on Kramatorsk railway station Boris Becker found guilty on four counts under Insolvency ActRussian missile that struck Kramatorsk train station daubed with \u0026#39for the children\u0026#39Politics latest news: Rishi Sunak may have broken ministerial codeWatch: US fighter in Ukraine issues \u0026#39plea for help\u0026#39 for more weapons to combat RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gardeners question time gets first ever chelsea flower show","story":"A new generation of gardeners are learning their heucheras from their hellebores after a lockdown boom in horticulture.And now, Gardeners\u0027 Question Time is to unveil its first ever Chelsea Flower Show exhibit to help listeners with their most common problems.The garden will be stocked with the plants most commonly asked about and will feature 75 years of gardening history since the show was first broadcast in 1947.Visitors to the flower show, set to take place at the end of May, will be able to ask their gardening questions to presenters inside a mobile studio. A special edition of the programme will also be broadcast on Friday, covering how gardening has changed in the past seven and a half decades.Matthew Wilson, a designer and regular panellist on the BBC Radio 4 programme, said gardening had recently returned to its 1940s roots, as householders grew more of their own produce and interest increased in preserving, pickling and foraging.In the 1950s, gardening became a battle rather than a pleasure as people sought to subjugate pests and weeds. Now, people are taking a more nature-friendly approach, he said.He added: When the programme started, we were still in food rationing, just coming out of the Second World War - people were still growing their own in order to supplement their diet.Whole tracts of UK parks and football pitches had been dug up to create allotments to create the \u0027dig for victory\u0027 campaign.The idea of leisure gardening at that point wasn\u0027t really on anyone\u0027s minds. It really started to develop during the 1950s. There was a huge rush to embrace all things new and shiny, manufactured and man-made - everything from nylon to garden chemicals.So gardening became very much a part of commerce, the transactional nature of living that happened in the 50s as the Western economy started to grow.That caused some things that we probably feel quite uncomfortable with now, like the widespread use of garden chemicals.Now we are very much focused on a more natural way of gardening, trying to be in tune with nature. \u0027Grow your own\u0027 has had a huge resurgence over the past 15 years, and another big resurgence during the pandemic.New gardeners are now more interested in exotic and unusual types of herbs or salad, or particularly tasty produce, he said, while their 1940s counterparts were focused on yield and productivity.But across the generations, certain things have stayed the same - such as the basics of how to compost well, how to manage different soil types, how to prune and how to avoid plants being killed by pests and diseases.A younger generation has recently embraced gardening, but the generational link in passing down skills has been broken, he said.Mr Wilson said: It\u0027s shifted to being a much, much younger group of people embracing gardening, and really getting into it in a way that we haven\u0027t seen before.It\u0027s the Instagram influencers and that body of people who are embracing the fun of gardening. They may not have all the technical chops, all the hard-earned horticultural badges of honour, but you don\u0027t need that really.Quite a lot of the panellists on the show - and I would put myself in this, my father was a cut-flower grower, so I was exposed to horticulture throughout my childhood - learned their gardening chops at their grandfather\u0027s knee, including some of the best-known gardeners in the country like Alan Titchmarsh, schooled by his grandfather.That I think has probably been lost in more recent times. We have a lot more leisure time and more disposable income. Time that might have been spent on grandad\u0027s allotment is now spent on holiday in SpainI think that connection has been lost to an extent, and I\u0027d like to think that the show and panellists are a sort of surrogate grandfather for people who are learning their gardening chops.”More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Dozens feared dead in rocket strike on Kramatorsk railway station Boris Becker found guilty on four counts under Insolvency ActRussian missile that struck Kramatorsk train station daubed with \u0026#39for the children\u0026#39Politics latest news: Rishi Sunak may have broken ministerial codeWatch: US fighter in Ukraine issues \u0026#39plea for help\u0026#39 for more weapons to combat RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"richard osman leaving pointless nearly 13 years","story":"Richard Osman is stepping back from Pointless after nearly 13 years on the show, the BBC has announced.The presenter and novelist, 51, has co-hosted the BBC One gameshow alongside Alexander Armstrong since its first edition in 2009.He will continue to host Pointless Celebrities as well as his BBC Two show, Richard Osman\u0027s House of Games.In a statement released by the BBC, Mr Osman said: Pointless has been a joy from start to finish, working alongside my friend Alexander Armstrong, backed by the most wonderful team, and for the best viewers in the world.I will miss everyone so much, but I\u0027m thrilled that I\u0027ll still be presenting the celebrity shows.I can\u0027t thank everyone enough for 12 amazing years.Mr Osman has filmed more than 1,300 episodes and nearly 30 series.I say that like it\u0027s a consolation - I\u0027m going to miss the big man next to me Monday to Friday.But at least I still get him at weekends - and weekdays if you\u0027re watching on Challenge.Mr Osman\u0027s debut novel, The Thursday Murder Club, was published in September 2020 and became a bestseller.Its global film rights were later bought by Steven Spielberg\u0027s production company Amblin Entertainment.A sequel, The Man Who Died Twice, arrived in September.Tamara Gilder, creative director for producers Remarkable Entertainment, said: Richard is a huge part of Pointless and his contribution to the show\u0027s success is immeasurable.We\u0027ll be sad to not have him as part of the daytime series, but we are very glad that he\u0027ll still be part of the Pointless family, presenting our celebrity specials, as well as continuing to host House of Games.Carla-Maria Lawson, head of daytime and early peak at the BBC, said: While we will miss his wonderful wit and charm on the daytime series, we\u0027re delighted that Richard will continue ribbing and riffing with celebrities in the evening schedules as well as continuing to helm the brilliant Richard Osman\u0027s House of Games for BBC Two.Pointless sees members of the public competing for a cash prize by finding correct but obscure answers to four rounds of general knowledge questions.Mr Osman was not originally intended to be Mr Armstrong\u0027s co-presenter but after filling the role as part of a demonstration laid on for the BBC, executives asked him to continue for the first series.The programme moved from BBC Two to BBC One after a successful two years.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Dozens feared dead in rocket strike on Kramatorsk railway station Boris Becker found guilty on four counts under Insolvency ActRussian missile that struck Kramatorsk train station daubed with \u0026#39for the children\u0026#39Politics latest news: Rishi Sunak may have broken ministerial codeWatch: US fighter in Ukraine issues \u0026#39plea for help\u0026#39 for more weapons to combat RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"scientists unlock secret looking 30 years younger skin deep","story":"Human skin cells donated from 38 and 53-year-olds have been reversed in age by 30 years, in a breakthrough that could open the door to regenerative medicine.Scientists at the Babraham Institute, a life sciences research institute in Cambridge, showed that the rejuvenated cells behaved more like youthful cells and helped to close wounds more quickly.The team adapted a Nobel Prize-winning technique, which allows skin cells to be reprogrammed back to blank-slate stem cells, using a special soup of proteins present at the early stages of embryonic development.In the new experiment, scientists halted this reprogramming before the cell entirely lost its identity, making the cells biologically younger, yet still able to perform as skin cells.Dr Diljeet Gill, a postdoctoral researcher at the Babraham Institute, said: “We have proved that cells can be rejuvenated without losing their function and that rejuvenation looks to restore some function to old cells.“The fact that we also saw a reverse of ageing indicators in genes associated with diseases is particularly promising for the future of this work.”As people age, their cells’ ability to function declines as the genetic code starts to gain errors. However, the new technique suggests that the clock could be turned back on old, failing cells.To show that the skin cells had been rejuvenated, the researchers looked for two measures of cellular age. The first is the epigenetic clock. Over time, chemical tags get attached to the genetic code and this accumulation can be measured as an indicator of age.The second is the transcriptome, the gene readouts produced by the cell, which falter over time.By these two measures, the reprogrammed cells matched the profile of cells that were 30 years younger compared to reference data sets. The cells were found to produce far more collagen, and moved to the sites of wounds faster than unprogrammed cells.The team also found that their method worked on genes linked to age-related diseases and symptoms, such as the APBA2 gene associated with Alzheimer’s disease, and the MAF gene with a role in the development of cataracts.Prof Wolf Reik, a group leader in Babraham’s epigenetics research programme, said: “This work has very exciting implications. Eventually, we may be able to identify genes that rejuvenate without reprogramming, and specifically target those to reduce the effects of ageing.“This approach holds promise for valuable discoveries that could open up an amazing therapeutic horizon.”The research was published in the journal eLife.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Dozens feared dead in rocket strike on Kramatorsk railway station Boris Becker found guilty on four counts under Insolvency ActRussian missile that struck Kramatorsk train station daubed with \u0026#39for the children\u0026#39Politics latest news: Rishi Sunak may have broken ministerial codeWatch: US fighter in Ukraine issues \u0026#39plea for help\u0026#39 for more weapons to combat RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"strange end did go wrong marble arch mound","story":"On a drizzly April morning, the scaffolders have nearly finished taking down the Marble Arch Mound. They swarm like termites over the sides of the structure in their orange high-vis jackets, calling gleefully to each other in that shouty argot only scaffolders speak. The final posts are being slipped from their fixings the last pins are being loosened. Where once there was a mound, soon there will be only the Arch, standing naked and alone on its roundabout.As London’s strangest tourist attraction, with the possible exception of M\u0026ampM’s World, recedes into the rear-view mirror, we can view it more clearly for what it was: a £6 million Covid fever dream, in which a middling concept was compounded by meddling, poor decisions and excessive haste. The results were naff, embarrassing and in the finest British tradition of this kind of thing, extremely funny. You can sort of see where Westminster Council got the idea. West London tourist numbers had slumped alarmingly during the pandemic. If there is one thing visitors around the world can agree on, it is that they like going up tall things to gaze down on the city. What are Primrose Hill and Parliament Hill, after all, if not aspirational mounds? The Shard is a kind of pointy mound, the Millennium Dome a wide and squat mound, the London Eye a high-concept circular and motorised mound. But the principle is the same. Marble Arch sits at the confluence of Oxford Street, the Edgware Road and Hyde Park. In theory it is not a bad viewing spot, especially if you like gazing down on Lebanese restaurants and Primark. Build a mound, the thinking went, and tourists would be drawn to the area, retailers would enjoy a boost and valuable column inches would be generated. In autumn 2020, Dutch design firm MVRDV was asked to draw up plans for the Mound. Their initial plans incorporated Marble Arch itself, before English Heritage and Historic England kiboshed that idea. The site had to move and become smaller, with steeper sides harder for trees to sit on. MVRDV, in their telling, were excluded from the execution of the project: a process made more difficult by Covid restricting travel between Britain and Holland. Even as it was being made, the Mound looked odd. The mock-ups promised a lush woodland paradise in central London. What emerged was a bulky and inelegant structure, clad in threadbare brown-green turf with a few spindly trees and surrounded by levels of scaffolding normally associated with the construction of a cathedral. “I live nearby and I first went along sort of out of bemusement,” says Dan Barker, a local resident, who booked a ticket (£7.50) for the opening day. “I couldn’t understand why they had chosen to spend what was obviously a large amount of money on a temporary structure at a time when scaffolding was at its highest cost in living memory. As the launch day approached, I could see it was nowhere near what the original designs had depicted.”He was not alone. The council was at least right about the press coverage. The problems began almost at once. The Mound was met with almost universal derision when it opened last July, variously called a “monstrosity” and a “disgrace”. Trees tumbled from the sides, unable to cope with the heat.Almost as soon as it opened, the Mound was temporarily closed. The council said it was to make improvements, but it seemed more like the sheepish panic of an organisation managing a fiasco. Even the decision to close was a mistake, says Barker, because it had started to draw visitors as a so-bad-it’s-good cult hit. When it opened again, it was without the same momentum. Barker paid for another ticket, for the final slot on the final day in January, but he needn’t have bothered. By the end they were giving them away for free. “The slot was for 10pm and there were all these people competing to be the last person on it. Strange to the end.” In August, Melvyn Caplan, the deputy leader of Westminster council, resigned. Professionally speaking, it can’t have been the hill he wanted to die on. Having initially said the Mound would cost £2 million to build, Westminster Council had admitted that the figure was in fact £6 million. The dismantling alone has apparently cost £600,000. The council’s projections estimated that it would bring in more than £2 million in revenue, with £1.5 million raised from a quarter of a million tickets and most of the rest from sponsorship, as well as food and drink sales and merchandise. At the time of writing, the merchandise had yet to see the light of day. (If you know of the whereabouts of any, please email.)A report in October said that senior leaders had hid details and lied about fundraising efforts. Debbie Jackson, the council’s executive director for growth, planning and housing, stuck to her guns, citing 250,000 visitors – not all of them in hysterics. There is more we have not been told chiefly how the costs trebled yet 44 council staff from Westminster were listed the other day among those making more than £100,000 a year.One day the Mound will give up its secrets, but compared to the money that was torched on PPE and Test and Trace, £6 million for a naff and misconceived tourist attraction seems like a bargain. If the council had deliberately spent the same money on a scheme to provide people around the country with a much-needed pandemic laugh, along with a sense of relief that they had not been involved in this catastrophe themselves, it would have been cheap. If there’s one thing that brings people together more than a hill with a view, it’s schadenfreude. With the worst days of the pandemic behind us, the slowly-shrinking Mound stands as a living monument to the psychological toll of coronavirus. Marble Arch was built by John Nash as a tribute to the monarchy at the height of empire. The Mound was a far more relatable piece of public sculpture. We might not all have spent £6 million of public money on a doomed 25m horticultural scaffold, but it was far from the most eccentric scheme cooked up in the strange circumstances of the past two years. There was a little Mound in all of us.More from NewsRussia-Ukraine latest news: Dozens feared dead in rocket strike on Kramatorsk railway station Boris Becker found guilty on four counts under Insolvency ActRussian missile that struck Kramatorsk train station daubed with \u0026#39for the children\u0026#39Politics latest news: Rishi Sunak may have broken ministerial codeWatch: US fighter in Ukraine issues \u0026#39plea for help\u0026#39 for more weapons to combat RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"waistline less half height magic ratio good health","story":"Keep your waistline to less than half of your height to stay in good health, new NHS advice warns.Draft guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) encourages everyone to get out a tape measure and tackle stomach fat, in order to cut the risk of a host of health problems.Until now, its advice has suggested that Body Mass Index - which measures the mass and height of a person - is enough to assess whether weight is healthy or not.However, the updated guidance suggests that abdominal fat carries specific risks. For example, a 5ft 4in female with waist circumference of 29in would have a healthy ratio, but 32in would push them into the unhealthy range.A man who is 5ft 10in would be at increased health risks with a 36in waist.The guidance urges health professionals to be “sensitive and positive” when starting conversations about the risks of excess weight, and to ask permission before raising the matter.It follows research which has linked abdominal fat to cancer, with visceral fat around the internal organs linked to a number of diseases.The guidance says anyone with a BMI below 35 kgm squared (the threshold for severe obesity) should use their waist measurement as a simple guide to see if their weight is healthy.Dr Paul Chrisp, the director of the centre for guidelines at Nice, said: “Our updated draft guideline offers people a simple and effective way of measuring their weight so they can understand the factors that could impact on their health and take action to address them.“Our committee found that a clear benefit of using the waist-to-height ratio is that people can easily measure it themselves, interpret the results, and seek medical advice if they are at increased health risk.”The guideline says a healthy waist to height ratio is 0.4 to 0.49, indicating no increased health risks.A ratio of 0.5 to 0.59 puts people at increased risk of health issues, while 0.6 or more puts them at the highest risk of health problems.Two in three adults in the UK are overweight or obese, with rates of obesity having doubled since the 1990s.Nice said using the waist-to-height ratio, in conjunction with BMI, can help to provide a practical estimate of “central adiposity” - the accumulation of fat around the abdomen - to help to assess and predict health risks, such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure or heart disease.Its experts added the waist-to-height ratio to its draft guideline after looking at evidence from several studies which showed that, alongside BMI, it could be used to assess and predict weight-related conditions in all ethnicities and sexes.It follows a long debate over the value of BMI, which is a less accurate measure of healthy weight in those who are extremely muscular.BMI does not take into account muscle mass, bone density, overall body composition, meaning that athletes with low levels of body fat are often classed as obese.Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: “Nice has finally endorsed a measurement which obesity specialists have advocated since 2015.”The new draft guidance says BMI should be interpreted “with caution” especially in those aged 65 and over, as well as in those with high muscle mass.It suggests that measurements are a more “practical” way to make an assessment.Prof Rachel Batterham, a consultant in obesity, diabetes and endocrinology and a guideline committee member, said: “Increased fat in the abdomen increases a person’s risk of developing several life-limiting diseases including type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Waist-to-height ratio is a simple, easy to use measure that identifies people who are at increased health risk and would benefit from weight management support to improve their health.”NHS figures show obesity was linked to more than one million hospital admissions in 201920 - a 17 per cent rise in a year.Government estimates suggest obesity is costing the NHS more than £6.1 billion annually, with £27 billion costs for wider society.Dr Nivedita Aswani, a consultant paediatrician specialising in diabetes and weight management at Sheffield Children’s Hospital, said: “A waist measurement can be taken independently by a young person in the security of their own home, or by a carer for their child. A waist measurement of more than half of a person\u0027s height, is an indication of greater risk.Young people should be encouraged to seek advice about weight management, and sensitively supported to lower their risk of developing these conditions, and to improve overall health and wellbeing.”The draft guidance states: “It is important for healthcare professionals to ask for permission before any discussions linked to overweight, obesity and central adiposity, and to discussing them in a sensitive and positive manner.“This is because the substantial stigma associated with obesity has negative effects on people’s mental and physical health, which can lead to further weight gain and make people less likely to engage with healthcare practitioners. Particular sensitivity is needed about the possible negative impact on people with conditions such as eating disorders or disordered eating.“Using words and language that avoid stigma and prejudice can help people to engage in conversations about obesity, and encourage weight loss,” it adds.A consultation on the proposed recommendations is taking place until Wednesday, May 11 2022.More from NewsBoris Becker found guilty on four counts under Insolvency ActRussian missile that struck Kramatorsk train station daubed with \u0026#39for the children\u0026#39Russia-Ukraine latest news: Dozens feared dead in rocket strike on Kramatorsk railway station Politics latest news: Rishi Sunak may have broken ministerial codeWatch: US fighter in Ukraine issues \u0026#39plea for help\u0026#39 for more weapons to combat RussiaMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eric pickles moans grenfell inquiry","story":"Eric Pickles moans to Grenfell Inquiry he has a busy day then gets death toll wrongTory Lord Pickles complained he had an extremely busy day meeting people and I would urge you to use your time wisely at the probe into the fire that killed  people, years after his war on red tape.

Lord Pickles, who led a crackdown on “red tape” while in charge of the housing department from  to , admitted ministers should have acted more on warnings before the blaze during two days of questioning. But on his second day he snapped to lead counsel to the inquiry Richard Millett QC: By all means sir, feel free to ask me as many questions as you like. “But could I respectfully remind you that you did promise that we would be away this morning and I have changed my schedules to fit this in. I do have an extremely busy day meeting people. But this is more important than anything - but I would urge you to use your time wisely.  Lord Pickles later apologised for “any way I seemed discourteous”, adding: “As soon as I left the room I took the decision to cancel everything. “This is more important than anything I’m doing and I apologise… I fully understand that you’re doing a proper job.” But at the end of his evidence, he tripped up separately - appearing to mistake the death toll for that of Hillsborough, which until recently was . The toll from the  football ground disaster rose to  last year after a coroner’s ruling on the death of fan Andrew Devine. Lord Pickles referred to coroneraposs recommendations after the  Lakanal House fire in south London, which killed six people and injured  more. The first report from the Grenfell Inquiry found lessons from Lakanal fire had not been learned by the time of the Grenfell disaster eight years later.  He said: “It comes down to Michelleand to the nameless  people who were killed in the Grenfell fire. Itaposs them who we should think about when weaposre arguing the toss. Ultimately, as Iaposve said earlier, the dead deserve the dignity of being remembered by name and the dead deserve the dignity of a solution.”Lord Pickles was also chairman of the Conservative Party from  to .He made the mistake at the end of his evidence while answeringthere was anything he would have done dferently. After Lakanal, he said, “maybe I should have put in the letter the simple sentence aposand I accept the coroneraposs recommendationsapos - would that have changed things ”. But he added: “I donapost think it would have made any dference whatsoever.  There was a kind of mindset that existed in parts of the department that just simply ignored what was happening, made a view about what we were and came to it. Askedthe department should have “done more” to take on the lessons from Lakanal he replied: “Oh, definitely”. He added it was a personal failing on his part, “on the basis that I’m responsible for everything. The fact that I didn’t know about it, that no one briefed me… is no reasonable excuse, because ultimately it is always my fault.” But he also slammed firms that used flammable cladding, saying: “The conditions existed that there were people putting things in, into  and the like, that were combustible. “The idea to me is: how would anybody ever want to do that  How would they ever think it was a good idea ” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Eric PicklesConservative PartyPublic inquiryRed tapePolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In , it won a £m contract with the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, and this year secured a £m IT contract from the Tory-run East Sussex County Council. Infosys is among companies which shared £m in public sector contracts between  and . It was one of  suppliers in a £m deal with Transport for London in , at a time when Prime Minister Boris Johnson was Mayor of London.And it was one of nine partners in a £m contract with Tory-run Westminster City Council last year. Angela Rayner, Labour’s Deputy Leader, told the Mirror: “The British public deserve answers. The Government is already awash with Tory cronyism. Now it seems the Chancellor’s close family are personally benefiting from lucrative public contracts. Rishi Sunak must come clean about these business interests and any potential conflicts.”And Ed Miliband said the Chancellor should issue an “explanation” about his we’s tax status. Speaking to Sky News, the Shadow Secretary of State for Climate Change said: “He is the UK Chancellor asking people to pay more in taxes. “Is it right that his immediate family is sheltering from UK taxes  I think Rishi Sunak and his family should reflect on that. Non-dom status is legal but I think we should be clear that non-dom status is used to... pay less tax than you otherwise would.”  Christine Jardine, Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman, said: “Infosys benefiting from millions in UK Government contracts raises serious questions. It is wrong that profits making their way from these contracts into the Chancellor’s household don’t face their fair share of UK tax.” Ms Murty, who wed Mr Sunak in , is one of Britain’s richest women, her stake of almost % in Infosys worth a reported £m. Earnings from its UK public sector projects contributed to global Infosys revenues of £.bn last year, which earned profits of £.bn. It is estimated Ms Murty earns more than £m in idends from her stake, but she is not domiciled in the UK for tax purposes. On Wednesday, her spokeswoman said because she is an Indian citizen and India does not allow dual citizenship, then “according to British law, Ms Murty is treated as non-domiciled for UK tax purposes”.  The spokeswoman admitted yesterday that Ms Murty pays £, a year for her non-dom status. And Professor of Accounting Richard Murphy said: “She is only non-domiciled because she asked to be so.” There is no suggestion of wrongdoing. But, as a non-dom, Ms Murty does not need to pay tax on idends from overseas firms such as Infosys. It was founded by her dad Narayana Murty, has its HQ in India and is listed on the Indian and New York stock exchanges. If taxed on £m of Infosys idends in the UK, Ms Murty would pay more than £m, while in India she would pay as little as %, or £.m. Tax Justice UK executive director, Robert Palmer, said: “Ordinary people who face an increase to their national insurance contributions this week will be shocked to learn the Chancellor’s own we is a non-dom. This status could potentially save her substantial amounts of tax. The Government should end tax loopholes such as non-dom status and make sure those who have wealth pay their share.” Labour leader Mr Starmer said: “The Chancellor has imposed tax rise after tax rise on working people and he’s said time and again there’s no alternative, we’ve got no option. If it now transpires that his we has used schemes to reduce her own tax then that’s breathtaking hypocrisy and is more evidence of just how out of touch this Chancellor is.”The Prime Minister dodged questions about Ms Murty’s tax affairs. He said: “I think it is very important in politics,you possibly can, to try and keep people’s families out of it.” Last week, Mr Sunak objected to questions over Infosys’s business in Russia, while telling UK firms to “think very carefully” about making investments potentially beneficial to Putin regime.He said he found criticism of his we “very upsetting”. It has since emerged that Infosys is closing its Russian office.  Mr Sunak last month delivered a Spring Statement which failed to tackle the cost of living crisis. He and his family live in a flat above No, but they also own a £m mews property in Kensington, a flat in Old Brompton Road, a £m, -acre country pile in his Yorkshire constituency, and a lavish apartment in Santa Monica, Calornia. After the Chancellor was snapped filling up a car – not his, but a vehicle belonging to a supermarket worker – after the Spring Statement, Mr Sunak said he drove an old VW golf. He failed to mention he had use of at least three others, a Range Rover, a top-of-the-range Lexus, and a BMW. The Mirror has contacted the Treasury, Infosys and Ms Murty for comment.

The situation is so bad that police chiefs are warning of a crime spree as desperate parents steal to feed their children. Boris Johnson accepted today that the poorest households were having to choose between heating and eating. What he refused to accept was responsibility.It was his Government that cut Universal Credit, slashed benefits and raised taxes to their highest level since the Second World War. When so many are below the breadline, you would think any Government would do everything in its power to alleviate their plight. It is actually doing very little. Only the Tories could be resigned to so many people living in hardship and only the Tories could be so unwilling to do anything about it.  Virus failure Britain is now paying the price for the Government’s hasty decision to lt all Covid restrictions. Hospitals across England have declared critical emergencies because high infection rates have left them struggling to cope with an increase in admissions and staff shortages. The travel sector has also been affected, with airlines forced to cancel flights because so many crew members are off sick. Boris Johnson appears to be in denial about the situation.

Conservative minister Greg Hands was asked about the government’s plans to help provide greener fuels for people and he also outlined the steps that were being made to help people deal with the cost of living crisis.Mr Hands referred to a £ billion package that Chancellor Rishi Sunak revealed last February where a one-off repayable £ discount and a rebate on council tax bills would help tackle the £-a-year rise in average household’s energy bills in April. The Minister of State for Business, Energy and Clean Growth said the £ discount was not just a loan. He told the Question Time audience: The Chancellor of the Exchequer launched a really important package in February, just two months ago to deal with the rise in bills, not deal with it completely, but actually £ billion set aside, a £ discount on energy bills, a £ discount on council tax, additional funds to make sure the most vulnerable are able ... give them assistance in paying their energy.” At that point presenter Fiona Bruce jumped in saying: £ is, of course, a loan  And Mr Hands replied: It is not a loan, it is a discount, which you have to pay it back in the form of a levy. Ms Bruce persisted: But you have to pay it back, it sounds like a loan   The government minister continued: Not the inidual, it gets taken back at the point that it is levied. With laughs and shouts from the audience, Ms Bruce said to them: You are all shouting, what are you all shouting  They yelled back: It’s a loan. Mr Hands kept going: It’s taken back through a levy, it is not a loan because it does not create an obligation on the inidual to repay, it is actually a levy on the price point. He added: It is put on the price point, not on the inidual. The inidual does not have an obligation to repay. Askedpeople didnapost have to repaythey didnapost want he responded with members of the audience chuckling: No I’m not saying that.  At that point Labour MP Emily Thornberry said: Soyou don’t heat,you don’t have any heating afterwards then you don’t pay it back. It is not an obligation, said Mr Hands. These are the important things which have been announced to help people with bills. But that is dferent to the long term strategy that we have launched today with renewables, nuclear and making sure we are not increasing our imports of oil and gas. Boris Johnson has also had to defend the government over claims that the new energy strategy doesnapost help people with soaring bills.He said the strategy - which sets out aims to boost new nuclear power, offshore wind and hydrogen - is a long-term plan focusing on energy supply, undoing the mistakes of the past and taking the big decisions now. He said the Government was already doing a huge amount to help people with the immediate cost of living and of course we are going to do more. The latest investment will support research, development and deployment of cutting-edge technologies, the Government said, adding that it was also publishing a range of important documents and guidelines to support the development of these industries. A financial package, announced last Friday, includes £ million to fund low carbon hydrogen production projects, £ million towards the acceleration of Carbon Capture and StorageTechnologies, and a £. million competition for bidders to develop a UK Advanced Modular Reactor .

The idea is to keep energy bills under control as we end Russian oil, coal andgas imports due to the “abhorrent and illegal invasion of Ukraine ”. But under pressure from warring Tories, Mr Johnson dropped key pledges on hilltop wind farms - and is set to plough more resources into North Sea oil.He also announced no help for families’ soaring energy bills now - and nothing new for insulating homes.  The ,-word policy was still being worked out at the last minute and was published as a simple web page, with no time for fancy graphs or even a proper PDF document.But the Tony Blair Institute said “expensive, slow and risky options [have been] backed over quick, cheap and popular ones”.So what is actually in the energy strategy and what are the gaping holes he missed  Here’s what you need to know. things the government has announced ‘Up to’  nuclear reactors in  yearsThe document vows to reverse “decades” of short-sightedness, including under Tory governments, and “invest massively in nuclear power”. It aims to take one “final investment decision” on nuclear - possibly a new site at Sizewell - by  and another in the next Parliament, by . Between them these could lead to eight reactors by , it’s claimed, because there can be more than one reactor at each power station. These could be a mixture of large ‘gigawatt reactors’ and Small Modular Reactors - raising nuclear from % of our power now to % in . But there are big questions about funding and how realistic ‘one reactor a year’ actually is - more below. It’s thought the “up to” eight new reactors would go on some of the eight sites already approved to host nuclear reactors. These are Hinkley, Sizewell, Heysham, Hartlepool, Bradwell, Wylfa, Oldbury and Moorside - with Wylfa lined up for an imminent project. After that, the government will “develop a strategy” that could identy new sites that’ve never hosted a nuclear plant before. But this seems a long way off. New investment in North Sea oil - despite our green goalsThe document pledges a new round of licences to launch this Autumn for oil and gas projects in the North Sea. It claims there’s “no contradiction” between this and Britain’s pledge to reach Net Zero carbon emissions - which will be a “smooth transition, not immediate extinction”. But Rebecca Newsom of Greenpeace UK said Tories are dishing out rewards to vested interests in the nuclear and the oil and gas industries. The document insists Britain will have “reduced our gas consumption by over % by ”. And “by , we will have decarbonised our electricity system, subject to security of supply”. That’s a get-out clause - it’s understood gas could still be used in some circumstances beyond . Meanwhile the strategy leaves the door open to fracking - currently banned thanks to the  Tory manesto - after Tory MPs urged a rethink. But that door is only just open. It says while the government “remains open-minded”, the pause on fracking “continues to remain in place unless new evidence emerge”. Lots of new offshore wind power The strategy repeats Boris Johnson ’s dubious pledge to become “the Saudi Arabia of wind power” with it generating more than half our renewable energy by .That would be “up to” GW by , including “up to” GW from massive floating wind turbines. The government will cut the consent time down from four yers to one strengthen policy statements and review habitat assessments from late  to ‘reduce reams of paperwork’ on protecting wildle. But again there are questions about cash. Today’s plan highlights a £m pot to kickstart work on floating wind turbines which Boris Johnson announced in the autumn. The UK’s first floating wind farm alone, which has five turbines, cost more than that entire funding pot. Energy firm Equinor spent billion Norwegian Kroner - equivalent to around £m - on the Hywind Scotland plant  miles off the coast of Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, in . Its ft high floating turbines each weighs , tonnes and has a rotor diameter of ft - equivalent to three Nelson’s Columns stacked end to end. A five-fold rise in solar power, with relaxed planning rulesThere is currently GW of solar capacity in the UK but the cost of building it has dropped % in a decade, so the government wants a five-fold rise to GW by . For ground solar farms, ministers will consult on tearing up planning rules to tip more “in favour of development” on non-protected land. Communities would still get a say. For rooftop solar , the government has vowed to “radically simply” the planning process, launching a consultation on using “permitted development” rights. This meansyou want to put a solar  on your roof, you could do it without having to submit a full-blown planning application. The government is also “looking at” getting banks to offer low-cost finance on solar  or energy efficiency for homes. But critics say it’s not enough - more below.Hydrogen, tidal and geothermal powerThe plan promises investment in hydrogen, tidal and geothermal power - but despite chatter about this for decades it’s pretty thin on details. It simply says we will “aggressively explore renewable opportunities afforded by our geography and geology, including tidal and geothermal”. Hydrogen - which could eventually replace gas in central heating for households who don’t get a heat pump - is a bit more concrete. The plan vows to double the target for hydrogen production capacity by , to GW. But that would be “subject to affordability and value for money”. There would also be a hydrogen certication scheme by , “to demonstrate high-grade British hydrogen for export and ensure any imported hydrogen meets the same high standards”. The Tony Blair Institute claims the hydrogen strategy is “bizarre” because it would create “signicant” new demand for natural gas in the production process. … and the  gaping holes in the plan Bottling Boris Johnson scrapped onshore wind targetsAn early version of the document pledged GW of capacity from onshore wind by  and GW by  - up from GW now. But despite hilltop wind turbines being much cheaper than ones in the sea, the final document drops this target - due to a Tory tussle over the “eyesore” machines. The pledge is seriously watered down, with a promise of “no wholesale changes” to the planning system. The government will “consult” this year on “local partnerships” where “supportive” villages that agree to wind farms could get cheaper bills in . But in a victory for rural Tories it adds: “The government recognises the range of views on onshore wind. Our plans will prioritise putting local communities in control.” There’s no help for energy bills now Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was revealing when he said: “I think the impact could be very soon. And by soon, I mean, three or four years.” The plan mentions the £ repayable rebate to energy bills, but offers nothing new, just as reports emerge that Rishi Sunak blocked a suggestion to raise it to £.Government officials insist they were never pretending this would give short-term help for bills, and it will eventually bring down costs in the long term. But the Lib Dems said: “Itaposs a disgrace that the Chancellor is refusing to offer extra help to hard pressed families facing soaring energy bills.” Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury Pat McFadden added: The Tories have no plan to immediately address their cost of living crisis.He could back Labour ’s fair and funded plan for a one-off tax on the booming profits of oil and gas giants - which would reduce household bills by up to £.” There’s nothing new for insulating your homeCampaigners hit out furiously at the fact that there’s no new hard fund or target in the plan today for getting old, draughty homes insulated. Simon McWhirter of the UK Green Building Council added: Today was a chance to insulate the nation’s homes, protect us against future price hikes and tackle the painful effects of rising energy costs to households. The Government has woefully missed its opportunity.”The funding for those nuclear power stations is very murkyAs above, a big new plank of the plan is investing massively in nuclear power stations - with three funding decisions in the next two parliaments. But what’s missing is any set amount of cash promised now. And that will be hard to come by, especially as a dferent PM - Labour or Tory - could be in charge by then. The document is also full of catches and get-out clauses about the hope of building eight new nuclear reactors by . It says: “Final contracts and construction would commence when any outstanding conditions are satisfied and projects are sufficiently mature. “Any projects would be subject to a value for money assessment, all relevant approvals and future spending reviews.” Imports of Russian gas CAN continue The whole reason behind the plan is Russia ’s brutal invasion of Ukraine, and our need to cut off the “war machine” by no longer buying Russian energy.But while coal and oil imports to the UK will end by December , we’ll only wean off Russian gas “as soon as possible thereafter”. Despite % of our gas coming from Russia, sources admit the industry - already handling rocketing prices - cannot afford the sudden end of Russian gas. That’s why there is no hard target on ending our dependence on Russian gas, despite Putin’s regime being accused of war crimes.

Millions of surplus aprons, visors, hand sanitisers and goggles are going under the hammer on the auction website Ramco as the Government bids to stop paying out millions of pounds of taxpayers’ cash to store stock. Labour analysis using average unit prices from the National Audit Office suggests that the Government may have shelled out more than £, for the goods at the height of the pandemic in . Ten lots of kits are now being sold with a starting price of just £ - with bidding ending on Tuesday.A -pallet lot of , goggles has a bid of £ while , aprons have an offer of £. Buyers must have their own lorry and be willing to pick up the goods from ious locations around the UK, the auction note states. It comes after Government accounts for   revealed around £. billion spent on useless protective gear has been written off.Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streeting said: The Conservatives wasted billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money on useless PPE that they’re now giving away for virtually nothing. If they hadn’t been so wasteful with the public’s money, the Government might not need to raise taxes on working people in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis.News of the PPE fire sale was slipped out as Parliament went into recess last week.Health Minister Edward Argar said: “To date we have achieved the sale of  million masks to two private companies, and we have other deals in the pipeline. “We are also about to launch an online auction to sell PPE, so iniduals and companies may bid for our excess stock.” He said  million visors had been recycled into food trays and surplus aprons were being turned into bin bags.  Products that cannot be recycled, sold or repurposed will be binned. Overall, the Department of Health claimed “the amount taxpayers will save from taking this decisive action would, for example, be enough to employ around , nurses for a year. Last month, MPs were told that the Government was planning to burn mountains of unusable PPE bought during the pandemic. Jonathan Marron, DHSC director general of office for health improvement and disparities, told the Commons Public Accounts Committee: Weaposre currently appointing to what are called lead waste partners, commercial firms who do this as their business who will help us recycle and weaposre also exploring using it for... waste to provide power. We think we move up to , pallets a month when we get these contracts in place, so a really signicant way of seeing recycling increase and indeed using some of the product to drive power generation.

Sienna Keera, , from Sydney, met her now-husband George Keywood after she became attracted to his character on British mockumentary People Just Do Nothing. After watching the comedy, about a pirate radio station called Kurupt FM, Sienna found she was attracted to the character Craig - who is played by George. Telling her story to Take  magazine, Sienna described him as a plus-sized man with beautul eyes.

Sienna had been planning a trip to Europe with her friend at the time, but when her friend had to pull out of the holiday Sienna decided to visit London, Amsterdam and Paris on her own.  And she had her sights set on meeting George for the first time when she landed in the UK.

George was unsure about making the move down under as it would mean starting from scratch in his acting career.

As time has passed Sienna has learnt how to block out the nasty comments and focuses on the many messages of support she receives. She said: Taking a chance on love like I did doesnapost always pay off – but Iaposm so grateful my leap of faith did.

You might find out that they’ve been given an iPad but have no internet connection, or that they don’t feel safe because some kids have been throwing eggs in the streets. “We have a lot of older people who shouldbe receiving benefits but they’re not. So we want to get that message out to them.

The poor pooch was picked up by dog catchers at just one-year-old after being found wandering the streets in search of food. He was later saved by Barking Mad Dog Rescue, who have been trying to secure him a loving home since summer . The four-year-old dog has been described as a friendly lad who has been waiting four years for a family to want him.Hilary Anderson of Barking Mad Dog Rescue said: It is sad to see him waiting so long before he is someone’s dog again. to our TeamDogs newsletter for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.  Patrick came from the public shelter to us in August . So really was still only a pup when the dog catchers had taken him. We think he was either someone’s pup who was then abandoned, or was looked after and handled by someone localhe had been born and lived on the street as he is so happy to see people and get some attention. Patrick gets on well with the other dogs in the rescue shelter so should be able to live with another dog in his new home. The crossbreed can be rehomed anywhere in the UK. Hilary, from Scotland, launched Barking Mad Dog Rescue after rescuing her dog Pixie following a Facebook appeal.She said: “Pixie lived in a park in Bucharest, with her mum, brother and six other dogs. “They were fed, vaccinated and neutered by a woman who wanted to help the park strays. “The pack survived the best way they could. Winters were harsh. Theirbuilt them a kennel and locals smashed it to pieces.” But their lives changed in  when new laws came in ordering strays to be rounded up and killed. “Pixie, like many others, found herself in a privately-owned shelter. Although safe from the dog catchers, Pixie had lost everything  - her freedom and her le. She stopped eating and couldn’t get used to le behind bars. ”In desperation, the woman who had cared for Pixie in the park posted her on Facebook asking for someone to take her away from Romania and give her the home she deserved.” Hilary answered this plea and ended up adopting Pixie alongside two other dogs, Elsa and Kirsty, before starting up her own rescue. The Barking Mad Dog Rescue team nowto Romania every two months to visit their own shelters in Constanta.

Top class schools, a buzzing high street, the good rail links and breathtaking views, all landed the town with the top spot. Judges said they were impressed by the sports clubs available and the opportunities that they present for young people. The guide to the UK’s best towns includes  locations and is decided by Sunday Times’s judges. They decided the best place in London to live is Crystal Palace, in Kent it is Sevenoaks and The Chalke Valley in Wiltshire is top in the South East.  In the North West the best place was Trawden in Lancashire. Residents of Ilkley were thrilled with the fantastic accolade. John Oddy, , a partner at Ascentis accountants told The Mirror: “I joke by saying it’s a bit like Royston Vasey, you will never leave. “But seriously it’s a wonderful place you would not get me out of here with a stick of dynamite. “The first thing to say about Ilkley is it is in a beautul part of Yorkshire to start with, in God’s own country, with all the wonderful scenery and walks.” He said during the pandemic “as horrendous as it was we were blessed to live in Ilkley because of the number of fabulous walks available. “In just over half an hour you can be in the Yorkshire Dales and a little beyond that you can be in the Lake District.  “We are  minutes away from Leeds Bradford airport and it’s great for families. “The schools are fantastic. People move here just to get into the schools. There is also a really great community spirit. The town is clean, there is no crime, certainly no violent crime.” And as for the sport, he added: “There are three cricket clubs actually in the town, level five rugby club with over  members. Ilkley tennis club is fabulous, the golf club and much more. “It’s dficult to think of a typical British sport you can’t play here.” Born and bred in Ilkley, Richard Bradley, chairman of the ‘Friend’s of King’s Hall,’ an Edwardian theatre in the town centre opposite the station, said: “We have been in the top five on a number of occasions so it comes as no surprise. It’s a fantastic accolade. “I will never leave. Why would you want to leave somewhere that offers so much  “It’s a wonderful town to live in and ultimately I am not surprised because the town has so much to offer for the young and for old.  “It’s got a wide range of restaurants and pubs. It’s not a wild night out in Ilkley - it’s ultimately more of an eating-in and events town. The youngsters go and drink in Leeds. My son is  and he will find it very boring and goes off to Leeds to do all the clubbing.” Former Londoner Trevor Yong, , a sales boss, has lived in Yorkshire since  and moved to Ilkley, where his we project manager Lucy, , is from, four years later. “When I first moved I thought it was the exact opposite of London in a good way.” Now settled and chairman of Ilkley Round Table, he said: “The people of Ilkley are some of the most generous, I personally, have ever encountered. Because of their time and their donations.” He said yearly they raise almost £, with two key events a year, the beer festival in February and the Ilkley half marathon. And even in the pandemic their virtual marathon raised £, to fund a child heart monitor at Leeds General Infirmary. “I think the community is what Ilkley is all about,” he added.

Mr Aldred then got out of his car and the woman said he squared up to me in quite an aggressive manner. The stunned woman made a complaint to Openreach about Aldredaposs behaviour and it turned out he had already been given a written warning by BT over his road rage previously. Mr Aldred, a customer service engineer, worked for Openreach from April  until April . As part of his job he attended yearly training about how to treat the public with respect.In a previous incident, he got out of his car at a KFC drive-thru and aggressively charged at an NHS doctor. He then went to verbally abuse the female driver and after being investigated he was later sacked and told his bosses to stick my job up your arse. However, after disagreeing with his sacking, Mr Aldred sued Openreach over his sacking, where a judge ruled there was absolutely no excuse in abusing the woman and that the engineer was lucky to keep his job for so long. Due to a fault in Openreachaposs sacking procedure, Mr Aldred won one claim of unfair dismissal on a technicality but he wasnapost awarded any compensation. The company is part of BT and is responsible for maintaining telephone lines which connect British homes and businesses to the national broadband and telephone network. Manchester Employment Tribunal heard complaints were made about Aldred in February  when an Openreach customer complained about him. In October , at Penketh telephone exchange, Cheshire, Aldred angrily swore at a staff member.A tribunal report said: Aldred told the tribunal that he was desperate for the toilet that day and had in fact soiled himself and in frustration had sworn at the member of staff. The [staff member], who had refused Aldred access, had done so because he had not provided the correct security pass. In October , there were concerns about Aldredaposs behaviour as was found to have been rude at a doctor. The report said: A member of the public who was a medical doctor in the NHS complained to Openreach about the behaviour of Aldred. He gave a detailed account explaining that Aldred was behind the doctor at the drive-through when he beeped the horn of his vehicle and shouted expletives including aposI havenapost got all fucking dayapos. When the doctor asked the claimant to stop, he alleged the claimant became more aggressive. The doctor got out of his vehicle to take a photograph of the number plate of Aldredaposs vehicle. He said Aldred then exited his vehicle and aggressively advanced toward the doctor shouting thathe had a problem, he should square up to him face to face. The doctor had a young child in the front seat of the vehicle who was becoming distressed. In that instance, Mr Aldred was suspended and given a written warning, admitting that he shouted I only have  minutes for lunch. And in December  he verbally abused the female driver, with the report saying: The member of the public alleged Aldred had been travelling at speed and almost aposripped off my doorapos. She admitted she had not seen the van coming around the corner. She put her hand up to apologise to the driver and was rewarded with a apostorrent of foul language being shouted at me through the windowapos. She then said that she walked around the corner to where the vehicle was parked, and a middle-aged man got out and began to apossquare up to me in quite an aggressive mannerapos. She admitted to swearing at him in response to his manner. The tribunal heard how Colin Aldred had reported the near miss but did not tell his boss about his offensive remark. He later admitted calling the woman a silly cow but denied confronting her. He was later sacked in April  but claimed it was unfair at tribunal. Employment Judge Katherine Ross said: Evenhe felt frustrated, Aldred should not have used offensive language in those circumstances. There is absolutely no excuse for it. We find Aldred was  per cent to blame. We have had regard to the evidence which shows that he had been involved in a series of incidents during the course of his employment where he had behaved offensively towards members of the public, another employee and his manager. A disinterested observer might consider that Aldred had been fortunate to keep his job for so long. Judge Ross said his dismissal was a reasonable response by Openreach. However, Aldredaposs claim of unfair dismissal succeeded as he was not given a recording of a witness statement before he was sacked. His compensation was reduced by  per cent as the judge ruled he would have been sacked evencorrect procedures were followed. Mr Aldred also brought claims of disability discrimination and harassment against his employer, alleging that he was discriminated against on grounds of his stress and anxiety. However, his claims were thrown out.

Image: Daily Echo Solent NewsByLiam Buckler:,  Apr |commentsA retired milkman claims he has been unable to shower or bath for two years due to council delays in installing a shower in his flat.Michael Davey, , from Southampton, struggles to get upstairs due to his arthritis and other health issues. He can no longer use the bath and instead relies on bed baths given to him by his we Stella.The father of two approached Southampton City Council back in  to install a shower in the bathroom due to his health issues, but no work has been undertaken. He said: I was told Iaposd have to move to another property before any internal adaptations would take place, but none of the homes I viewed online was suitable for a disabled person. I havenapost had a shower or bath in two years. I feel Iaposve been ignored by the council.In order to fund improvements, people applying for a means-tested Disabled Facilities Grant must have their needs assessed by an occupational therapist. And Southampton is one of ten council areas in England and Wales where disabled people wait on average more than a year before they can submit an application, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism . Once applicants apply, they can then wait a further  months for the work to be started, which for Michael is a long time to wait. Fazilet Hadi, of Disability Rights UK, said disabled people often found it dficult to complete simple everyday actions that others took for granted. Itaposs critical that councils keep this at the front of their minds when telling disabled people there is a wait of months for adaptations. A Southampton City Council spokesperson today cited the high demand for alterations to properties. Long waits can often be due to special or complex situations but we aim to deal with critical cases within four weeks. The councilworking very hard and pushing to reduce waiting times where possible. aposaposThe pandemic has added additional pressures with increased staff absences and home visits restricted so we could protect the people we work with, causing delays to assessments, approvals and completion of works. Southampton City council declined to disclose how many people are on the waiting list but said the list is easing. In order for properties occupied by people with mobility issues, they are often funded by a Disabled Facilities Grant. In  a report published to say the means-tested grants had helped more than , people a year to live in more accessible housing since its inception in . However, there is a long wait before someone disabled can apply for funding as their needs must be assessed by an occupational therapist, with thousands of disabled people across the UK are waiting months to be assessed - and waiting possibly years to have the work completed.A Southampton City Council spokesperson said: Disabled Facilities Grant cases are often complex and the time taken from initial application to approval and subsequent completion will y considerably depending on the scale of the works and the needs of the inidual. Additional resources are being recruited across the teams and a large-scale service review is underway to identy improvements to service delivery. This has lead to campaigners calling for an increase in the number of purpose-built houses to be built for the disabled, as applicants can be forced to wait years. The Disability charity Leonard Cheshire says people in two thirds of English council areas wait longer than a year, with a quarter of council areas waiting more than two years. A spokesperson for the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, said, We recognise the importance of improving accessibility, and the number of accessible homes has nearly doubled in a decade. Councils are best placed to decide how much accessible housing is needed in their area and they should reflect this in their plans for future development.

Millions of people in the UK have been left worried about the huge hike in energy costs that has left some going cold as they canapost afford to put on the heating.But Martin has come up with a list of ways to stay warm without resorting to putting on central heating, reported the Manchester Evening News.In a change from his normal advice about cutting costs, he has been forced to suggest more desperate methods. The Good Morning Britain expert pointed out how people can wear heated USB gloves, hand warmers, an electric gilet or an electric blanket to get warm without having to heat the entire house.  His guide also told of the benefits of layered clothing and thermal tops while eating food regularly keeps people warmer. Martin said: I felt sad asking my team to put this together, but my email bag is full of folk so desperate they canapost put the heat on, I wanted to try some help. Pls share. Full cost of living survival guide coming soon Martin added on his site: This is a guide I really wish we needn’t be publishing. The reason I asked Sarah and the team to put this together is due to my overflowing e-mail bag of desperation from people who can’t afford their energy bills. So don’t see this as an ‘MSE or Martin says you should do this’. Itaposs more that we’re trying to help provide some options and information for those that may need to drastically cut down on energy usage due to financial desperation and some help for others who may want to do it out of a commitment to green issues.  Martin pointed out in his guide that it costs only £ to buy a cheap electric blanket which in turn, costs p an hour to run, even in todayaposs climate of rising costs. That equals a cost per week of £.used for seven hours a day. An electric gilet, basically a heated jacket, would cost £ to buy and just p per week to run, while USB gloves would cost p per week to run and just £ to buy. Another consumer expert Jack Monroe reached out to Martin Lewis for the guide, adding: Thank you for your vital and heart breaking service, friend. I know this is taking a hell of a toll on you, please please take care of yourself out here. We need you now more than ever, but we need you well and fit for what’s to come.  Martin responded: What lovely words - thanks Jack. Yes Iaposm feeling the pressure, but thataposs trivial compared to the trauma many are facing being unable to afford to live. Martinaposs loyal legion of followers praised the tips, but expressed their disbelief that they were necessary in one of the worldaposs largest economies.Jon Wilson said: Good tips but itaposs  in one of the worldaposs wealthiest economies  weaposre one step away from the Universal Credit journal suggesting claimants Google how Bear Grylls went about sleeping in a deer carcass to keep warm.

Image: MyLondon BPMByZak Garner-PurkisLiam Buckler:,  Apr Updated:,  Apr A mum claims a council has moved her into an unliveable home after her four-year old daughter fell into a ft hole in the kitchen.The schoolgirl, who has autism and ADHD, was fortunate to escape with just scratches and bruises after falling into a rotten floorboard, MyLondon reported.Mum Fiona Wood admitted her child was lucky to have survived the fall, she said: “She fell over the balcony and it was only because I grabbed her by a hair and swung back she didnapost fall to her death. “Theyaposre telling me to let her sleep in the sitting room where she had easy access because there was no lock key on the balcony door and she could fall over the balcony at any time.”  The mum now fears each time she hears the floor creak as her -year old daughter could have pierced her ankle as the floorboards are so sharp. She said: “She was really lucky because the way the floorboards snapped they were so sharp they could have pierced straight through her ankle. “Even the workmen said sheaposd been so lucky she just didnapost seriously get injured.” Fiona admitted that on another occasion, a brick from the garden fell and bruised her leg, which she reported to the council.  The families council home in Havering, east London was previously stated as void - which meant no tenants were allowed as expensive work was needed in order for the property to be liveable. And reports provided by surveyors estimated the total amount of work needed to get the council home up to scratch was around £,. The mum-of-two cannot understand why she was allocated the house and thinks it must have been a council oversight. Whilst Fiona has been in non-permanent housing for the past six years, the council home is classed as temporary.  However, Fiona was toldshe were to reject a property she would be classied as intentionally homeless - which would make her disqualied for any form of council housing. Left with no other choice, the mum had little choice to accept the house in such a bad state of disrepair. There were also other issues in the house which Fiona had reported to the council, which included an electric fireplace with a draft that left black soot on the carpet, and broken radiators in the childrenaposs room. She reported the house has rotting floorboards upstairs, while an entire fence had collapsed in the garden. When she reported her faulty bathroom light, Fiona said she was left in the dark for two weeks as she waited for a repair. Fiona said: “Itaposs absolutely disgusting. Iaposve been put in this house that I should never have with the void on it, especially with a disabled child.” A spokesperson for Havering Council said: “The council is currently investigating this case.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Housingproperty newsRenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She was alarmed when it seemed to show she might have leukaemia so made an appointment at her local health centre. Doctors disagreed with her self-diagnosis, giving her beta-blockers and arranging blood tests the following week.Two days later she woke to find her gums bleeding so called Craigavon Hospital and was advised to come to AE where tests confirmed she had acute myeloid leukaemia, Belfast Live reported.Chillingly, she was told had she waited another two days for tests as she had been advised, she may have died. The mum of two said: “I had a feeling in the back of my head that things weren’t right.  “A short time after arriving at the hospital, I received a blood test. The results came back very quickly and when both a doctor and nurse came to talk to me. I just knew it was serious. I was advised to go to the City Hospital in Belfast right away and on arrival was met by a consultant and nurse who admitted me immediately and broke the news that I might have leukaemia. I cried and the first stupid question I asked was, ‘Am I going to lose my hair ’ My thinking was thatI lost my hair, the girls would know I was really ill, so I would have to tell them the truth. Chemotherapy treatment started immediately between February and September , the young mum had intense chemotherapy and tests showed her bone marrow was clear of cancer. There was another blow in December when further tests revealed the leukaemia was back. She underwent a stem cell transplant from her sister, Alison and stayed in quarantine for three months while receiving full body radiation and chemotherapy injections. Unable to continue working, she now spends her time taking care of daughters Lily , and Meabh, , whilst attending hospital on a regular basis for checks. She added: “I am so grateful to everyone who helped me, giving me more precious time with my girls. On the th of this month, I will be three years post-transplant. I call this my other birthday, so I will be three. There is one thing I would like to say to anyone going through a cancer journey right now. You will have days when you are feeling sick, or perhaps feeling down, try to stay positive. Remember that no matter how rough a day you are having there is always someone worse.

Peter Rhodes, , says he doesnapost play the lottery very often and only buys tickets when the winnings are bigMr Rhodes says alarm bells started ringing when he took his ticket to a shop in London and he alleges his National Lottery jackpot was stolen by a shop employee when he tried to cash in the ticket.The pensioner claims a woman in Camelotaposs operations team confirmed it was worth £.million but hours later he says he was contacted by the lottery firmaposs fraud team saying they will not pay out the winnings - because it had already been claimed. Mr Rhodes, from London, told The Mirror: Itaposs a le-changing amount of money. They havenapost stolen from me. They stole my kidaposs futures. That money was going to be for them. I turned  a couple of weeks ago and I never asked anything from anyone. Mr Rhodes says he took his ticket to a shop in London in October  and when the shopkeeper put it through the machine it allegedly made a noise to indicate he had won something.  He said things then became very strange and claims the shopkeeper refused to give his ticket over. Mr Rhodes said: When I first went in and handed it over the shopkeeper put it in the machine and it made a noise, meaning it was a winning ticket of some sort. I didnapost know how much was on it and he then refused to give me my ticket. I asked for my ticket back and he took three steps to the right and put it under the counter. I leaned over and saw he had about  tickets under the counter. He picked one up and paid me something like £.. He tried to say it was my ticket and it wasnapost. I know it wasnapost because I folded mine twice and put it in my wallet and this one was flat.Mystery surrounds the winnings, with the shop where Mr Rhodes went to cash it in not making a claim. Mr Rhodes said: I spoke with someone in operations [at Camelot] who went out of their way to find an electronic footprint to prove I had bought the ticket. I donapost buy tickets every week, I only ever bought tickets when it was a large jackpot. I had the bank print off the statement and she found the ticket through that - and that is when I learned it was a £.million ticket. Then I got a call from their fraud department saying they are shutting down the case because they wonapost pay out twice. In search of his winnings, Mr Rhodes contacted the police. He has hired a solicitor and plans to take his case against National Lottery as far as he can. He said: I was so frustrated because it was the start of lockdown and I went to the police and they told me it is a civil matter. If National Lottery really cared about changing peopleaposs lives - then they need to sit up and listen. They would have more respectthey came out and help shut down shopkeepers who do this. A politan Police spokesperson said: In May  police received a report of fraud relating to a lottery ticket purchased in October . This was initially dealt with as a civil matter. In September , following further contact from the complainant, officers liaised with Camelot who confirmed there was no evidence that any fraud had been committed. As a result, the case has been closed – should any further information come to light then this decision can be re-assessed. A Camelot spokesperson said: While we canapost comment on the specics of this case, weaposre aware that Mr Rhodes has now instructed solicitors and weaposll be responding fully to his solicitors in due course.

The -year-old however has previously been convicted for conning people into buying cheap electronic goods, taking the money and then failing to deliver the items, the Daily Record reports.Police have now launched a fresh probe into the new claims made against Higgins suggesting he is doing the same thing to women he meets on dating sites. Fleur Brand revealed how she fell for the -year-old after seeing his profile on Bumble.She was left furious after handing over money for electronic goods that Higgins never delivered, prompting her to demand her money back. The -year-old met Higgins after seeing his profile on Bumble in October . She believed she had met a lovely guy who lured her in with generous treats and the façade of a luxury lestyle. Weeks into their relationship, Higgins convinced Fleur to send him hundreds of pounds for an iPad from the electronics company he works for. Fleur never received the tech and spent almost a year fighting to get her money back.After taking to social media to name and shame Higgins, Fleur was sent dozens of messages from other people targeted by the conman, many reporting that he is continuing his deceit on Tinder. Fleur told the Daily Record: “This man will say everything you want to hear. He told me he was looking for a relationship and told me he had a bad past experience with an ex he called a ‘psycho’. “He had a really nice car, he dressed really well and he always came over to my place with fancy takeaways and wine. He seemed to be very generous.” Their relationship soured when Fleur began to question why the iPad she had paid for never turned up. She claims Higgins turned “nasty”, accusing her of harassment and being bitter “just because he didn’t fancy her” in dozens of messages. He sent Fleur excuse after excuse as he dodged her requests, mostly blaming issues with online banking. When she told him she would have no choice but to contact the police, he threatened her with “pals” he claimed to have within the force. Fleur kept in contact with Higgins over the next year in a “push and pull relationship” hoping to find proof of deception.  After she threatened to go to the police in January , he quickly transferred some cash, but continued to provide excuses over the rest. It was only after a chance meeting with him in an Edinburgh restaurant in February this year, where she seized his phone and refused toit until he coughed up the cash, that she finally got the rest of her money back. But the experience has left her “beside herself” as she has struggled to come to terms with his behaviour. Fleur said: “I didn’t eat for about two weeks and lost a stone. He made me feel so upset with myself for accusing him. I was beside myself.” Dozens of women have now reached out to Fleur to say they were also targeted by Higgins since she outed him on social media in March. She added: I wanted to warn others because of the mental impact this had on me. This man made me feel like I was going mad.”  One previous victim revealed how Higgins scammed her out of cash for electronic equipment that never came before he was convicted for the scam in . She told how Higgins will target anyone – male and female – he thinks is gullible enough to trust him. The woman, who did not want to be named, was conned twice by the conman and revealed he even convinced a mourner at a funeral to give him money for the non-existent phones. She said it was the death of a mutual school friend that reunited Higgins and other people from the village they grew up in, Balerno near Edinburgh.  She said: “I tried to warn people years ago on selling sites not to believe a word he says. Many people have lost money because of him. I feel strongly that people should know this man is a fraud and will say anything to get you to back off when you’re chasing him for the phone or your money back.” Several people have complained to the police and Higgins pleaded guilty to fraud in January . He was order to pay compensation to victims.  The Daily Record contacted Higgins for comment on his current mobile phone number but he did not respond to calls or online messages.He also deleted his Instagram account yesterday after the Record attempted to contact him over social media. It is understood he lives in a property in Livingston. A Police Scotland spokesperson said: “We received a report on Friday, February , , raising concern about the activities of a man in the Edinburgh area. No criminality was established and suitable advice was given.“A further report was received on April  and officers are carrying out further inquiries.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON FraudDaily RecordTinder\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She gave Miss Thorne clozapine, which had been intended for another resident, on October , . Instead of owning up to what she did, Ms Hutchinson then tried to cover up her mistake by taking Miss Thorne to bed and leaving her there until she was discovered, Senior Coroner Dr Robert Hunter said.Miss Thorne was found by the care support worker around midnight, when undertaking routine checks on residents”, the inquest heard. And then Ms Hutchinson’s mistake was only discovered after an audit was carried out of the medication trolley and a dosage of clozapine was found. Upon the discovery of Miss Thorne by a care support worker, the alarm was raised and Ms Hutchinson arrived “within  seconds”. However, when she got there, she said that Miss Thorne had already died and no CPR was carried out and an ambulance wasn’t called, completely contrary to care home rules. Chesterfield Coroner’s Court was told how the care home’s response when a patient is found unconscious and unresponsive is to begin CPR and call an ambulance. Dr Hunter also heard evidence that Ms Hutchinson, despite being the nurse in charge that evening, was not qualied to very death but took it upon herself and stated that Miss Thorne had died or was dead. He also told the court that after Miss Thorne’s death, the care home did not of itself initiate any meaningful investigation into the circumstances of Miss Thorneaposs death. Even though Ms Hutchinson mistakenly administered the drug that led to Miss Thorne’s death, she wasn’t suspended from duty.

Never miss a moment by signing up to our newsletter here.  Ann Gibbons, one of the care homes directors, said a suspension was discussed but could not give a reason as to why it didn’t happen. This meant that Ms Hutchinson was left in charge of residents and responsible for their care and safety following Miss Thorne’s death. This “continued to place other residents at risk of harm and danger”. In his summary, Dr Hunter said: Either the directors and management of Whitwell Park failed to appreciate the signicance of the circumstances in which Miss Thorne came by her death or they chose to bury their heads in the sand, rather than being proactive in investigating and taking appropriate action in relation to Katherine Hutchinson. When confronted with the fact Ms Hutchinson had no qualications, Dr Hunter said: We heard that Katherine Hutchinson alleged to have a degree in nursing from Sheffield University. “My investigations both at Sheffield University and Sheffield Hallam University found no record of Katherine Hutchinson ever attending a nursing course there or for that matter graduating with any degree or diploma. Ms Hutchinson began working at the care home in September , but did not have her induction marked off until May .Whilst Mary Marsh, the registered manager of Whitwell Park, said that she had assessed Ms Hutchinson twice on the administration of medication, no paperwork was submitted to show she had been signed off as competent. On top of that, any training for Ms Hutchinson was shown to have only been documented after Miss Thorne’s death. Angela Starr, an inspector for Care Quality Commission, made an unannounced inspection of Whitwell Park in February  and found the training records for staff were very poor. In particular, Katherine Hutchinsonaposs training records were poor. Delivering their verdict, Dr Hunter said: The healthcare professional was aware of the error and failed to report it or take any action to seek medical attention for Miss Thorne. “The failures to acknowledge the drug maladministration and to seek medical attention were gross failures and as such Miss Thorne’s death was contributed to by neglect. Whitwell Park Care Home has been approached for comment.

As the family remembers Philip, they may reminisce about the happy times they spent with him, especially during the summer holidays at Balmoral.And in a documentary last year, several of his grandchildren, including Prince William shared a particularly happy memory of a food prank Philip used to pull while at the royalsapos Scottish retreat. But it seems the Queen didnapost always find the funny side. In the documentary Prince Philip: The Family Remembers, William revealed how his grandfather would get family members to hold a tube of mustard in their hands before removing the lid.He recalled: He would squish your hands together to fire the mustard up into the ceiling.He used to get into a lot of trouble with my grandmother for covering most of the places where we had lunch with mustard.

In one moving interview, his oldest son Prince Charles recalled the last time he spoke to his father - the day before he died at Windsor Castle.Charles said he rang him to ask him what he would like to do to celebrate his th birthday.The Prince of Wales described how he tentatively broached the subject with his father, daring to suggest a party he knew Philip was not keen on. Weaposre talking about your birthday, Charles said he told his dad. Knowing his father was slightly hard of hearing, he then repeated himself more loudly, emphasising: aposWeaposre talking about your birthday! And whether thereaposs going to be a reception!apos To which Charles said Philip replied sharply, without missing a beat: Well, Iaposve got to be alive for it, havenapost I  Charles then said: I told him aposI knew youaposd say that!apos and added that it was a happy memory.

The sprinteraposs dad died aged  in , having married four dferent women, but only ever orcing one of them. He had not made a will, leading to a bitter fight between his fourth aposweapos Florence Ania, Olympian daughter Emma and her mum, Patricia Ania, over his east London home. Judge Nigel Gerald ruled retired nurse Florence was only in a marriage of convenience with Austin and found that Emma and her mum donapost have to hand her a single penny. But the court heard that Emma, who competed for Team GB in the  Olympics - has also been left with nothing because of the costs of fighting with her aposstepmum.apos  Emma Ania, now , was a successful athlete and was part of the British team which failed to complete the  x m relay final at the Beijing Olympics in  following a baton handover mishap. She missed out on London  due to injury, but has since gone on to forge a successful career as a personal trainer. She was one of nine children which her father had with his first two wives, Mary, who he later orced, and Emmaaposs mum Patricia. He married Patricia in  and separated in , but despite not going through a orce went on to marry a younger woman, Toyin, two years later. That marriage also failed, but again he failed to orce before marrying his fourth aposweapos, Florence, in , meaning Patricia was his last lawful we. Mr Ania had suffered with ill health for much of his adult le and died in , sparking a fight over his home in Leyton, east London.  Following a trial at Central London County Court last year, Judge Gerald threw out claims by both Florence and Patricia that they were entitled to the house, which was in Mr Aniaaposs name. Giving judgment, he said emotions have run particularly high between the warring parties, with Patricia and Emma taking a very strong dislike to Florence. The combined view of the defendants is that Florence is an imposter, essentially, who entered into a civil marriage of convenience with [Mr Austin] and has sought to take advantage of his frailty and advanced years to get money out of the estate, he said. Florence, on the other hand, regards herself very much as the wronged woman because it is her position that when she married the deceased she did so in good faith, not knowing that he was already married and therefore was entering into a bigamous marriage. Although they had married at Haringey Registry Office in , Mr Ania and Florence had never been a genuine couple, the judge found. Their marriage was simply a way for Nigerian-born Florence, who had had an asylum claim rejected, to get permission to stay in England.Florence, who had claimed to have sacriced  years of my le to care for Mr Ania, had told a straight lie, he said. They had not married in a tribal ceremony in Nigeria, but only in a civil ceremony in London to help her stay in the UK. At no time did Florence regard herself as having anything other than a fake marriage or marriage of convenience with the deceased, he found. Florence and the deceased connived to concoct the marriage of convenience purely and solely to enable Florence to remain in the United Kingdom because her asylum claim was bound to fail, because it was based on a tissue of lies. Not only did she willingly participate in the  civil marriage, knowing that it was not genuine, but there never had been any tribal marriage, so giving the lie to her claim that the civil marriage was a renewal of vows. However, because Mr Ania had provided a home for her in his final years, she had been dependent on him and so was entitled in principle to a payout from his estate under the  Inheritance Act, he added.  But the case went back to court this week after Florence claimed that the Leyton house had been deliberately sold below its true value in order to defeat her claim to a payout. Although an expert had valued the property at £,, Emma and Patricia as administrators of the estate had sold it for only £,, leaving nothing to fund a payout to Florence after estate debts were paid. For Patricia and Emma, barrister Stephen Boyd denied that the property had been deliberately sold at an undervalue to avoid having to give Florence a penny, pointing out that would harm them too as they were due to inherit most of the estate. Patricia was the main beneficiary under intestacy rules and had intended for the house to be her family home, but had to sell it because she could not get a mortgage to fund the £, needed to refurbish and extend it, he said. A deal had then been agreed with an Icelandic businessman to purchase the house for £,, reduced to £, only because they had been unable to get Florence to leave first so it could be sold empty. Giving judgment, Judge Gerald said the £, valuation was not reliable, given the appalling state of the property, its sitting squatter Florence and the fact that it was effectively a forced sale. He said mother and daughter had been placed in the position of having to sell due to unpaid debts owed by Florence from a previous court case relating to the validity of her marriage with Mr Austin. It seems to me very dficult to challenge the integrity of the decision which Patricia and Emma made to enter into this contract, he said at the end of a four-day trial this week. There is, in my judgment, nothing surprising or untoward in the acts, conduct and behaviour of Patricia and Emma, as administrators, or the third party purchaser. There is no evidence of any nature whatsoever of any untoward collusion. In many respects, Patricia and Emma were put in the position of a forced sale. The judge said Florence had made largely bogus claims during the case, including an off-the-cuff accusation that Emma, who lives in Belgium, and the Iceland-based purchaser are in a relationship, simply because she had been told Emma had a white boyfriend. He continued: Now that the property has been sold and the proceeds largely spent, from the estate accounts I have been provided with it is quite plain that the estate has negative assets. Her claim under the  Act must fail, because there was no money. It must follow that the claim must be dismissed. Ordering her to now leave the house so that the new owner can take possession, he said Florence is a squatter with no legal right to remain there. You have got  days before you have to get out of the house, Iaposm afraid, he told her. You will have to contact the local authority. Speaking afterwards, Emma Ania said she hoped the family could now put the six-year battle behind them.

The -year-old teacher told pals she normally avoided walking through Cator Park in South East London at night but cut through because she was rushing to meet a friend at Depot bar on September . Koci Selamaj, , had lain in wait at the park for  minutes with his hood up, before he struck Sabina with an emergency traffic triangle and dragged her into the bushes. He then strangled her in the undergrowth and left her body to be discovered by a dog walker  hours later. Selamaj was today jailed for le with a minimum term of  years for the murder of primary school teacher.  Mr Justice Sweeney described the savage attack as sexually motivated.The judge said Sabina was the wholly blameless victim of an absolutely appalling murder which was entirely the fault of the defendant. He added Sabinaaposs death added to the sense of insecurity particularly felt by woman walking through the city at night. Mr Justice Sweeney added: She had every right, as her family said, to be walking through the park all glammed up and out to enjoy herself after a long week at work.The defendant robbed her and them of her le.Alison Morgan QC told the court yesterday: It was out of character for Sabina to walk in Cator Park after dark. Sabina had discussed being concerned about being there after dark. Ms Morgan said: It seems likely that she chose to walk across the park that night because she was running late and this was the quickest route to get to the Depot Bar. Selamaj, an Albanian national from Eastbourne, East Sussex, was arrested on September  after being recognised on CCTV.The clip showed him running towards Sabina and “striking her repeatedly”, before carrying her out of sight and later emerging to pick up pieces of the weapon. Sabinaaposs body was found nearly  hours later by a dog walker hidden underneath a pile of grass. Selamaj admitted murder last month and faces le in prison, but yesterday and today refused to attend court. Mr Justice Sweeney called his decision cowardly. Members of his victimaposs family gathered at the Old Bailey this afternoon, with supporters of the Sabina Project also outside holding placards.  Mr Justice Sweeney ruled the sentencing could go ahead in the absence of the defendant as the court had no power to force him to attend. The defendant had also been captured on CCTV footage stalking the hotel lobby of a five-star hotel where his we worked just hours before setting his murderous sights on Sabina. Garage worker Selamaj planned the savage murder after being rejected by his we in his home town of Eastbourne.  He murdered the primary school teacher just weeks after his we left him due to his domestic abuse, which included him “throttling” her at least three times. Selamaj tried to persuade his we to have sex with him just hours before his attack, but she refused. The defendant booked a £ room at The Grand Hotel in Eastbourne, located five minutes from his home. Ms Morgan told the court the booking was indicative of his premeditation to have some kind of sexual encounter that evening.

But in a lawsuit against the giants, he claims a real Whopper is actually anything but.Legal papers claim that the burger is actually % smaller than portrayed in the companyaposs adverts.Coleman and countless others say they felt cheated when they discovered the actual size of their grub. Now he is demanding Burger King be held accountable for allegedly misleading the public.  The lawsuit, filed last week in the US District Court in Southern Florida, claims that Burger King is misrepresenting the size of its food in its ads. Customers are continually duped into buying a substandard product, it states. In addition to damages, the lawsuit also demands that Burger King “correct the deceptive behaviour.”Burger King advertisements portray the company’s burgers with “oversized meat patties and ingredients that overflow over the bun to make it appear that the burgers are approximately  per cent larger in size, and contain more than double the meat,” the lawsuit reads. “Burger King’s advertisements for its burger and menu items are unfair and financially damaging consumers as they are receiving food that is much lower in value than what was promised. A spokesperson for the restaurant said: “Burger King does not comment on pending or potential litigations.” It is not the only legal action the company has faced when it comes to the burgers.  A group of disgruntled vegan fast food fans filed a lawsuit after Burger King were found to be cooking their meatless Impossible Burgers on the same grill as their beef patties. The class-action lawsuit was filed by Phillip Williams, who says as a result of Burger King’s cooking methods, his supposedly meat-free meal was contaminated by meat by-products. According to the lawsuit: Burger King has no disclosures on its menu that would noty a consumer prior to the purchase of the Impossible Whopper that it was cooked in a manner that would result in meat by-products on the burger.

I love them all more than anything, but I’ll be the first to admit that our house is in constant chaos and it can get very exhausting. My sister is child-free, but loves my kids and was happy to watch them to help me keep my sanity. This has been extremely helpful and I tell her all the time how grateful we are for her help.The thing is that the kids used to go over to her house, but right now they canapost because my sister is fostering an elderly chihuahua. My sister claims she couldn’t have them over for the time being because they would stress out the dog. Her dog was extremely frail and timid, so I think this was a fair assessment. This was the th dog she has fostered, all of which couldn’t be around my kids. When she told me she found an adopter I knew I could finally breathe a sigh of relief and joked about how I was so glad she could babysit again. My sister proceeded to tell me that there was a second dog that desperately needed a new foster, so she planned to take in that one as soon as her current dog was gone. So, she couldn’t do any more babysitting than she already is.  The woman confessed her husband doesnapost help as much as he should, so sheaposs relying on her sister to lend a hand whenever she can - which wonapost be possibleshe keeps fostering dogs. She added: I haven’t ever done this before, but I opened up to her about how much I have been struggling since she got the dog. How little sleep I get each night and how my husband hasn’t been helping as much as he should. Then I asked her, point-blank, to not get another dog. She comforted me, but ultimately didn’t agree on anything and said she needed some time to think. I know I am asking a lot of her since rescuing dogs is her passion and that is why I feel so guilty. But I don’t have anyone  to help me. Above all, my kids will always come before a dog and that’s the reason I was willing to request it. I’ve told a few dferent people about the situation and gotten a wide range of heavily biased opinions. The womanaposs post also ided people in the comments, as while many sympathised with her struggles as a parent, they were also keen to point out that her sister isnapost obligated to babysit. One person said: You don’t sound like a bad person but you are definitely not entitled to your sisteraposs free child care. I understand you need help, handling  kids on your own must be incredibly dficult and stressful. Your sister is very generous to help you out this much but you cannot just expect her to make lestyle changes to accommodate you. I would recommend that you talk to your husband andhe refuses to help, maybe he can pay for a babysitter  While another added: It isn’t her responsibility to watch your kids for you.

Some brides also kindly offer to cover expenses for their bridal party, paying for dresses, accessories and transport. One bride-to-be has shared how she decided to buy bridesmaid dresses for her three close friends back in , ahead of her planned wedding in .However, after the pandemic hit, her wedding got postponed until  and this has caused a few issues.Taking to the internet, the bride asked for some advice after one of her bridesmaids demanded she buy her another dress for the wedding as she no longer fits in the original one.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox. for a Mirror newsletter here. Writing in a post on Redditaposs Am I The A**hole forum, the anonymous woman explained: Between  when bridesmaid dresses were purchased and now, one bridesmaid aposJaneapos had put on signicant weight. In Mid , she started a fitness journey with the goal of getting back to her original weight.In February , Jane came to me and told me she couldnapost fit into her bridesmaid dress, and sheaposd need a bigger dress. Since itaposd been two years since purchasing the dress, it obviously couldnapost be ed. She gave it back since, but the value had signicantly decreased, especially since the dress was now discounted by the store itself. FYI, The bridesmaid dresses werenapost identical. We went with dresses that went well together had a similar aposvibeapos. She goes on to say that she had a chat with Jane and offered to give her whatever she makes from selling the dress to put towards a new one - although it wonapost be the full original amount. She got upset and told me it wasnapost her fault she gained weight and couldnapost fit into the dress anymore and since I was the bride, I should pay for a new dress. I told her that it wasnapost personal and Iaposd have the same response for anyone , she continued. I told her it didnapost have to be expensive, just had to fit the vibe or be somewhat similar to the old dress. Iaposm not a bridezilla or anything, so I didnapost care too much about what dress she chose to wear and offered to help her find a new dress within budget.  However, this did little to please the bridesmaid and she dubbed the bride an awful friend and accused her of fat-shaming. She said she couldnapost afford a new dress and said I had to pay for her dress or she couldnapost be at my wedding. I told her I couldnapost pay more than I was offering for a new dress, and I understood that she couldnapost be a bridesmaid and I hoped sheaposd be able to make it to the wedding as a guest. I tried wrapping it up but she wouldnapost leave. She teared up and called me cheap for not paying for a bridesmaid dress since Iaposd paid for everyone aposs, and thatI really wanted aposmy friendapos there Iaposd actually make an effort and brought up how much we were spending for our wedding and how aposan extra small purchase would be nothingapos. I wonapost lie, this did upset me. I told hershe didnapost want to buy a new dress, the only other options were to not come or find a way to fit into the old dress. She broke down crying and ran out, and later told others in the bridal party that Iaposd told her thatshe didnapost lose weight, I was going to kick her out of the bridal party. Thankfully Iaposd already talked to them before this and they didnapost believe it, but now Iaposm getting pressure to buy her a new dress so we can just move on and get over it. She asked fellow Reddit usersshe was being stubborn in refusing to buy a new dress orit was the right decision.  More than  people replied, with many agreeing the bride wasnapost in the wrong and it was generous of her to have paid for the first dress.One person said: You gave solutions itaposs crap sheaposs saying youaposre an awful friend and shaming her. Another wrote: I’ve been in a few weddings and never had the bride purchase our dresses - you’re amazingly generous! It sucks your wedding got postponed and she gained weight, but she’s lucky they weren’t identical and she could find another option. A third commented: Was going to say you were [the a**hole] based on the title, but youaposve already bought her one and itaposs been ed, youaposve said it doesnapost have to be costly, youaposve offered to help her look, youaposve offered the money from the original dress. Sheaposs currently on her aposcompass of shameapos so itaposs likely sheaposs angry at herself for the weight gain and placing it on you, but it isnapost your fault. If she apologises and backs down soon, Iaposd still have her as a guest, but under no circumstances a bridesmaid anymore. She went to try and make you look bad to your friends. Thataposs a whole other thing than asking for advice or backup.What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON WeddingsViral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

The goal settled the Royal Burgh side, and Lewis Montgomery added a brace on  and  minutes.In Mowi South Division , Kilmory ran out - winners against a young Oban Celtic second team at sun-drenched MacRae Park, Lochgilphead.Goals from Sandy Leiper on  minutes and three by Alex Cunninghamsealed the points for the Kilmory.The home side enjoyed a good first half and would be disappointed with aof just two goals. Play was more scrappy in the second period but Kilmory managed to close out the match.The club thanks Crinan Construction for sponsoring the match and all the supporters who came out to watch.In the same ision, Inveraray and Bute juniors drew - at the Winterton.Bute started the match strongly, using their pace and youth to advantage. It did not take long for Craig Speirs to gave the islanders the lead on six minutes, rling home from the angle.Two minutes later Inveraray were level, Neil Campbell showing scoring from  yards.Bute again took the lead in the th minute when Aray failed to clear and Aiden McGregor took advantage.The home side settled into the game after that setback and started to play some decent shinty, though, despite creating numerous chances, the sides went into half time with the score - to Bute.Inveraray started the second half the better of the two sides, giving the youthful Bute side problems settling.With Inveraray pressing it took until the th minute for the equaliser to arrive Neil Campbell again driving the ball home.

All her walks can be booked as bespoke guided experiences.*The  bus service is only available on schooldays term time you would need to start and finish at Muasdale. The Scottish Citylink bus times are not suitable.**If you start and finish at Muasdale, carefully check tide tables and aim for an ebb low tide for the whole coastal section from Killean to Muasdale.With sandy beaches, an igneous dyke splitting red sandstone and the impressive waterfalls on Clachaig Water reflecting geological history, man’s time here is reflected in a prehistoric dun, the old settlement of Achaglass and abandoned dwellings that span right through the centuries.Amongst these are the wonderful old ruins of St John’s church at Killean, parts of which date back to the th Century.Although you can no longer go inside it is still possible to walk around the graveyard and view the impressive carved tombstones from a distance.According to Canmore records the burial vault is that of the MacDonalds of Largie it is believed they helped prevent further deterioration of the church in the mid-th Century.The start point is A’Chleit Church, which replaced St John’s in the th Century. Leaving the car park head south via a short path to the beach.Follow the beach south for the next .km. En route a couple of small streams are crossed.It is sometimes easier to go above the beach, especially as you approach the large rocky outcrops near Muasdale.Look out for a path that takes you up to a stile just before you reach Clachaig Water .Cross the stile and main road. Turn right to gain a view from the new bridge to the old bridge over Clachaig Water.The village store is m south of the bridge should you need refreshment. Return north from the bridge and take the first turning right .Follow the track up the hill for m until you reach a field on your right. Cross this diagonally towards the west corner of the forestry plantation.On reaching it turn right into the woods to look at the waterfalls at the bend, which, I gather, are called Peter’s Hole . The drop is sudden and vertical, so take care!From the falls head upriver, descending into the plantation, before re-ascending northeast above the river and trees.Follow the field edge you will go over a small knoll and reach a fence line. Turn left up the side of South Crubasdale farm to rejoin the track you left earlier.Turn right, then after m turn right again. The track will drop you down to a bridge over Clachaig Water before rising to a T-Junction.Turn left. After m look for a gate on your left. To visit the Duncross the field diagonally andthe same way. Please keep dogs on a lead.Continue northeast on the track for m to a Y junction. Bear left past the now empty Low Clachaig farm and bear left again at the next Y junction. Continue to High Clachaig. There is a ruined farm off to your right en route.At High Clachaig it is best to go round the buildings and walls to the right before rejoining the little used track that heads northeast into the forestry.The track is grassy and boggy # especially near the stream crossing # but easy enough walking for the km to Achaglass.Achaglass is an old settlement that appears to have been rented to a shepherdand his family back in . It has now partially disappeared amongst forestry, like so many old sites in Argyll.Continuing northeast up the Clachaig Water from Achaglass there is a fine sheep fank, m beyond this there is a bridge.Cross the bridge and take the forestry track northeast for the next .km until you reach the Kintyre Way.Note there is a cattle grid with no side gate en routeyou have a dog you may need to lt them over the fence.Turn left. You will now follow the Kintyre Way down to the coast for over km.You can take a slight short cut by taking a left at NR and then bearing right at NR down to the ruin of Braids, but it is muddier.Near the bottom, after a small dam, a left turn will drop you down through the eerily empty houses of Killean to the main road. Opposite is St Johns’ church. Cross over with care.After visiting the church take the lane on the north side of Killean burn towards the sea # gate climbing may ensuelocked.

‘Towards a Federal United Kingdom’, launched by herself and Malcolm Bruce MP, referred to the Liberal Democrats’ policy on a Federal UK.‘I suggested that a strengthened and re-born UK, perhaps reinforced by a new symbolism which more accurately reflected the constituent countries might be considered,’ explained Mrs Michie.‘For example, Wales and Northern Ireland are not included in the Union Jack,’ she added.The document stated that, for many, the Union Jack had been ‘devalued’ in modern times by its ‘association with the Tory Party and the National Front’ and the national anthem had been similarly hijacked by the English rugby team.Commented Mrs Michie: ‘The media did not report that the anthem and flag belonged to the Queen and Country and that I was concerned that they were being taken over by some to represent only part of the United Kingdom, for example in sport and other instances of more sinister use.’FIFTY YEARS AGOFrom Budapest, then to Lochgilphead, to play whist

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Many are willing to go the extra mile to help.I am pleased to congratulate, and thank, Campbeltonians for their collective attributes, which the rest of the country would do well to aspire to.I would like to set the record straight regarding South Islay Development ’s Port Ellen playing fields #community hub# development which was covered in last week’s Campbeltown Courier.I am one of the objectors who went round every door in Port Ellen. We gathered hundreds of signatures against this, which got the first lot of plans scrapped.So SID changed the plan to suit the roads department and resubmitted the planning application.Most of the objectors didn’t know they had to object again.SID didn’t knock on every door and ask how folk felt about it. They put leaflets through people#s doors and a lot of people didn’tthem.They also had open days, normally through the week, when people are working and can’t attend.And that is the reason I, for one, couldn’t attend the virtual planning, protective services and licensing committee meeting. People have full-time jobs and can’t attend these things at am on a Thursday.The community of Port Ellen is ided over this development.This was always intended to be a community space and now it’s being developed for tourism.We know and understand something has to happen in the area but it should have been to benefit the community, not more space going to tourism.The campervans are an eyesore but don’t think we’re saying we don’t want them on Islay, but there are places better suited for them outside the village.Equally, the people in these campervans will probably pick somewhere they have a good view, quiet and relaxing, rather than by the main road, where all ferry traffic passes.Islay will soon be unrecognisable, all for tourists and nothing for the locals.

Since God is eternal and therefore stands outside of time, it may be that every moment in time is always present with him.And yet, the Bible often speaks of God not remembering something – people’s sins.One example is Jeremiah chapter  verse : ‘For I will forgive their wickedness and will remember their sins no more.’It is not that God forgets in the way that I forget where I have left my wallet or car keys.In the Bible, ‘to remember’ is another way of talking about keeping a promise. We use ‘to remember’ in that way too.‘Don’t forget to phone me when you arrive home,’ shouts Morag, as her daughter heads home after visiting her.‘Don’t worry, Mum. I’ll remember.’Sure enough, Morag’s phone rings later, and the voice at the other ends says: ‘It’s me. I’m home.’God does not forget our sins in the sense of pretending they never happened or ignoring our failure and refusal to do what he wants.Instead, he remembers his promise to forgive the sins of anyone who asks him to do so.He is able to do this because Jesus has died on the cross to deal effectively with sin’s penalty.So, when you trust in Jesus, God refuses to hold your sin against you, but treats you in the way you do not deserve. He forgives you and remembers your sins no more."},{"url":null,"title":"minato-sushi-cheese-lady-boost-haddington-town-centre","story":"The Cheese Lady on Haddington High Street is moving into the former butcher premises of Colin D Peat on neighbouring Court Street.The move from High Street has opened the door for Minato Sushi to bring the Japanese delicacy to the town centre.The changing face of the town centre was welcomed by councillors Tom Trotter and John McMillan, with the new businesses set to open this summer.Jen Kerr, of Minato Sushi, stressed there was still plenty of work ahead at the business before the doors opened.The -year-old, of Port Seton, who will run the business with her boyfriend Tom Cuddy, described it as “a real dream come true”.She said: “We are really excited.

to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.There is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. Some of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website here.The Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours."},{"url":null,"title":"galaxy-smarties-see-easter-eggs-least-sugar","story":"Expressdentist was intrigued to find out which Easter eggs could be the best and worst for your teeth, based on sugar content, so it investigated to see what the worst for sugar content is, so you don’t need to avoid all sweet treats this Easter.Coming in the joint top spot for the Easter eggs worst for your teeth are Galaxy Ripple and Galaxy Minstrels Easter Eggs with g of sugar per g.Although two Mars Galaxy products take the top spot, the other two Mars Galaxy productsrank respectively th and nd.: I tried Aldis new Easter egg range - but which ones are worth buying In second place is the Smarties Easter Egg with .g of sugar per g.

People are also being advised to take a test prior to visiting someone who is vulnerable.If you develop symptoms, you should continue to get a PCR test.On vaccination, the First Minister said: “The advice to everyone, of course, remains as important as ever – please do take the opportunity to get vaccinated as soon as you are able and make sure you get all doses of vaccine that you are eligible for. This remains the most important thing any of us can do to protect ourselves and others.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is now surely a matter of huge regret for our communities that so many small-scale care providers # despite their good reputation and obvious appeal in rural parts of the country – have been allowed to wither on the vine and disappear. on standards which followed the Covid outbreak in April and May .Budhmor’s owners are not a shadowy offshore conglomerate trying to put profit before care – but CrossReach, the social arm of the Church of Scotland. Despite their benevolent roots, the modern pressures facing the sector, they say, simply make it too dficult to keep their Portree home open.The building needs too much work and they don’t have the money to pay for it.The only option, families were told, is closure – with the suggestion that the  residents could all be accommodated nearby in a refurbished and expanded Home Farm.It is not dficult to understand why families are so aggrieved at this proposal.Things may well have improved at Home Farm since the horrors of Covid, but have all the lessons been learned The blanket national policy of shting patients from hospitals to care homes in the frantic weeks of early  was a huge factor in the devastating Covid death toll that followed.Yet now, with the pandemic still not behind us, families in Skye are being told they should accept the transfer en masse of their elderly relatives to the very home so ravaged by coronavirus when it was proven to be over capacity and understaffed.At Budhmor, they managed to keep the home safe from the worst of Covid-. Relatives of residents will tell you that was no fluke – but down to good standards, diligent management and conscientious staff.There will be some truth in the financial and staffing pressures that CrossReach cite in their reasons for closure. But two years on from the outset of Covid, should the sector not be doing all it can to preserve and build on the success of an institution which proved such a good example during the pandemic, rather than bowing to the bottom line and accepting its loss.There is also the matter of an options appraisal on health and care needs in the north of Skye, currently being prepared by NHS Highland.Closure must at the very least be halted until this review is complete – andthis requires support for CrossReach, our Government should find it.In the longer term what we really need are alternative models to those that are currently governed by economies of scale than on inidual or community needs. An agenda of rationalisation and centralisation has taken hold of far too many of our public services and is ultimately driving decisions like the closure of small care facilities offering a homely, personalised environment in favour of a vast, but possibly distant one many miles from an inidual’s home community.No-where has this been more obvious, or dangerous, than in the west Highland health and care sector.We should start the fightback by backing Budhmor care home, and keeping it open."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1649233437067.jpg--chinese_named_northern_ireland_s_most_popular_takeaway.jpg?1649233438000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220406newschinese named northern ireland s most popular takeaway","story":"The decision-making process of ordering a takeaway often ides opinion, with debates sparking almost every day as households fail to come to an agreement on which delicious treat they should indulge in.

These will be taken in conjunction with GMB who also represents bus workers at Translink. The strike action planned will be a week, starting April  and concluding on May , as well as a single day on Friday, May . The strike comes after members of the union overwhelmingly voted for industrial action after rejecting the latest Translink management pay offer. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham expressed her support for the striking bus workers. She said, “These bus workers are frontline workers – they deserve respect and a pay increase. Translink needs to grasp that there’s a cost of living crisis destroying the value of wages andwith a more acceptable offer. “Unite’s members have my full support and that of their union in taking this strike action for fairer pay.” Unite deputy Regional Secretary Davy Thompson is lead officer for Translink, Northern Ireland’s bus and rail public transport provider. He added:“Unite represents the overwhelming majority of bus workers, and this strike action taken in conjunction with GMB which also represents bus workers will shut down all bus services. “Bus workers deserve a pay increase. The ball is in the court of Translink management. They can to avoid this unnecessary and highly disruptive strike – they need to address our members’ legitimate pay expectations.” Meanwhile, Peter Macklin, GMB Organiser, said:Every worker deserves fair pay. With rampant inflation, this real terms cut is a slap in the face and will leave many struggling to cover their bills. “Translinkfails to recognise what workers went through during the pandemic. “They kept transport running so other essential workers could get to and from workplaces to perform vital roles. “Our members were proud to carry out their duty in delivering the service, potentially putting themselves and their families at risk. When we clapped every Thursday night, we said the essential workers would not be forgotten or left behind. But during this cost of living crisis, Translink is forgetting their own workers. “The dispute, which affects bus drivers, cleaners and shunters will close the entire bus network within Northern Ireland. It will be a complete shutdown.” A Translink spokesperson said they were disappointed that the unions hadvoted to take industrial action. “Following extensive negotiations, including with the Labour Relations Agency, we made a pay offer of % plus an enhanced package of conditions that included a % increase in weekend and overtime rates along with  extra days holiday, they said. “We believe this was a fair and reasonable offer and have at all times been open to discussions. We remain committed to working with the unions to avert this action. “We would welcome the opportunity to engage with unions to cover school duties, so that the wellbeing of schoolchildren can remain a priority. “All train services will continue to operate as normal. “We will communicate relevant passenger information through the media, on our website www.translink, through social media, in stations and on buses and trains. “Translink apologises for any inconvenience this may cause”."},{"url":null,"title":"ballycastle is northern irelands best place to live in 2022 proud locals are in full agreement as co antrim town edges out derry and","story":"Seafront: Ballycastle has been named Northern Ireland#s best place to live in the annual Sunday Times list.The mile-long beach at Ballycastle was described as beautulMarie Fox with baby EvaFinn DelaneyClaire Byrne FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueSeafront: Ballycastle has been named Northern Ireland#s best place to live in the annual Sunday Times list.Allan PrestonTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailFor the people of Ballycastle, it seems an obvious choice their home town has been picked as the best place to live in Northern Ireland.As they pass by its picturesque harbour, families and business owners in the Co Antrim town talk fondly of the epic coastal views on their doorstep.Rathlin Island is a short ferry trip away and Scotland is also visible on a clear day.Although a small seaside town, Ballycastle boasts a thriving Main Street with multiple cafes, greengrocers and fish and chip shops.Picked as part of the annual Sunday Times Best Places to Live, Ballycastle was chosen ahead of Londonderry and Helen’s Bay.Read MoreGarrett Hargan:OpinionDerry one of best places to live in Northern Ireland: A rich history, friendly people, and proud music and sporting traditions make city a fantastic place to liveDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read More‘There’s no place like home’: Derry Girls writer Lisa McGee reacts to city being named among top places to live in NIRead MoreBest places to live in the UK revealed They said of Ballycastle: “This unspoilt fishing village is a real coastal town rather than a tourist honeypot, with a strong independent streak and a welcoming atmosphere.“There’s a vibrant food scene, with everything from old-fashioned fish and chips at Morton’s by the harbour to tasty sourdough at Ursa Minor bakery.“The mile-long beach and beautul surroundings make it a blissful base for families.”With an average house price of £,, Ballycastle has experienced growth of % since .Enjoying time at the play park with two of her children, lelong resident Marie Foxagreed it was an ideal spot for families.“It’s definitely good for young ones.

That means there is much for visitors to explore, from ancient to modern history.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s Bay‘There’s no place like home’: Derry Girls writer Lisa McGee reacts to city being named among top places to live in NIYou have the completely intact -year-old Derry Walls which is a real selling point for tourists.Other historic landmarks include the Guildhall — where it now stands was once the middle of the River Foyle where ships moored. It was mostly destroyed by fire in  and after extensive rebuilding was opened in .Because it is relatively small in size, Derry is an easy place to navigate for visitors.A key piece of infrastructure built in recent times was the Peace Bridge.Nowadays it is hard to imagine the city without it, and it’s an area of recreation popular with walkers and joggers.That area is arguably the best feature of the city, expanding the city centre, linking to Ebrington, St Columb’s Park and the renovated railway station.The Peace Bridge connects the Cityside and Waterside it was a masterstroke both in practical terms and as an act of symbolism by reconnecting the largely Catholic Cityside to the traditionally unionist Waterside. Derry is also a city of culture — made official in  — with musicians, poets, painters and actors famous the world over.Danny Boy is one of the most famous songs in the world, and has been covered by Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and Eva Cassidy. Phil Coulter, The Undertones, Dana, Cara Dillon, Johnny McDaid of Snow Patrol fame, Red Organ Serpent Sound, Fighting with Wire, SOAK and Wood Burning Savages show the range of musicians Derry has produced.It is also a city with proud sporting traditions in GAA and football and has produced Olympic medallists and world champions who first learned their trade on Derry’s pitches, roads and rivers.Nowhere does a festival like Derry, but there should be more added to the calendar.You have Glasgowbury in Draperstown, the City of Derry Jazz and Big Band Festival, the legendary Halloween festival and, in recent times, the Foyle Maritime Festival, which have all proven popular.When considering Derry, you also have to factor in the location. A short drive across the border and you’re in some of the world’s nicest beaches including Dunree and Tullagh Bay.To Derry’s advantage in the Sunday Times survey was an average house price of £,.“Reaping the rewards of years of investment and with a fine cultural reputation, this much-improved city stands out as somewhere cool, credible and cheap, with a bright future,” The Sunday Times states.But most people in the city would disagree with that statement, as multiple-deprivation measures, unemployment rates and analysis of investment show the second city has not received a great deal of inward investment.For example, since Invest NI was formed in  until   it has assisted , new jobs in Belfast whereas Foyle got , and East Londonderry ,.In that time it invested £.bn in Belfast and £.bn between Foyle and East Londonderry.Most ReadArlene Foster accuses Naomi Long and Alliance Party of being ‘nasty’ when ‘mask slips’ in Twitter spatStormont department apologises and drops its legal challenge over whistleblowerLurgan mum diagnosed with cancer in AE told she only had ‘hours to live’Derry Girls premiere: Watch as cast and crew in city for special screening of third seriesBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s BayTop VideosPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner Dornan\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRhys McClenaghan becomes new Guinness World Record holderPlayDerry Girls season  premiere: #We#ve shown people another side of Derry#Latest Northern IrelandBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtRegeneration plan to be developed for ‘frightening’ Shaftesbury Square in BelfastJenner Dornan’s mother ‘will never forgive predator O’Neill’ as she welcomes le sentence handed to killer‘Compelling’ evidence led jury to convict Raymond O’Neill of Jenner Dornan’s murderWest Belfast man Raymond O’Neill found guilty of murdering Jenner DornanLatestBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtRegeneration plan to be developed for ‘frightening’ Shaftesbury Square in BelfastJenner Dornan’s mother ‘will never forgive predator O’Neill’ as she welcomes le sentence handed to killer‘Compelling’ evidence led jury to convict Raymond O’Neill of Jenner Dornan’s murderSadiq Khan takes final swipe at outgoing Met chief Dame Cressida,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Picture: Google Maps FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueBelfast#s Shaftesbury Square. Picture: Google MapsMichael Kenwood, Local Democracy reporterApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailBelfast council has vowed to work on a “tactical regeneration” plan for the rundown Shaftesbury Square area in the city centre.The area used to be the crowning glory of Belfast’s so-called “golden mile” – which stretched from Lisburn Road along the fullof Great Victoria Street – but in recent decades has seen steady decline and is noted for its empty premises and dilapidated facades.This week during a meeting of the City Growth and Regeneration Committee at Belfast City Council, elected representatives agreed a proposal from council officers to create a plan for the area to be shared with the relevant Stormont departments, businesses and other stakeholders. The “tactical regeneration” scheme will also look at enhancement of the Castle Street area.It involves quick short term and low cost actions such as transforming dingy former shopfronts, opening up public realm space by taking away street clutter such as bollards, opening up fenced off areas, introducing artworks, parklets and greening.A committee report states: “Whilst certain businesses have sustained a presence in the area and continue to make a positive contribution in terms of well-maintained active frontages, there are a number of vacancies and the wider area is in need of signicant intervention.“It should be noted that there are several development proposals progressing through the planning process in the wider area, and major public sector placemaking and infrastructure projects like Belfast Streets Ahead  and BRT  also have the potential to have a transformative impact.“However, the timescales associated with emerging or committed public and private projects in this area are y, and in some cases uncertain, and there is a growing consensus among local stakeholders that there is a need for shorter term action.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up It adds: “Officers are proposing that a tactical regeneration scheme is worked up for part of this area initially. Whilst the detail needs to be developed, it could include a combination of minor works to building frontages, while also taking advantage of generous footway widths along Great Victoria Street through measures such as removal of street clutter and introduction of soft landscaping and greening opportunities, where possible.“It is proposed that a scheme be developed that focuses on Great Victoria Street, east and west sides, from Bruce St to Donegall Rd, as a priority given the condition of this area.”The council says that the Stormont Department for Communities has indicated that funding may be available in the   financial period,projects can be developed up to a “business case” status.Further funding may come from the South West Quarter Stakeholders Group, a group comprising a mix of private sector business council officers, Translink, NIHE and two Stormont departments.DUP Botanic Councillor Tracy Kelly said: “If you look at Great Victoria Street and the mouth of the city centre, it’s absolutely horrendous. It needs a massive piece of work and investment. So I am so glad to see some thought going into it.“There are a few shops going on to the Donegall Road, just off Shaftesbury Square that recently got funding from the council to give them a bit of a le with shop front work and a bit of paint, and that has made a massive dference already.”She added: “When you think of the golden mile, and what it used to be – it is quite frightening now at night time around there.”Green Councillor Mal O’Hara said: “Parts of the inner fringe around the city core have been ruined by the car dependency of this city and the need to ensure we have traffic flow. Sandy Row, a once vibrant and bustling shopping district, has been ruined to become a cut-through for traffic flow.” He asked for space to be taken away from private cars as part of the regeneration projects.In , a £ million Belfast Transport Hub was approved by the council, involving the creation of a new bus and train centre on the other side of Durham Street to the current Great Victoria Street bus and train stations Those stations will be replaced with a mall.The wider Weaver’s Cross plan involves the regeneration of land to the immediate south of the current train and bus centre, land currently used as parking space on either side of Hope Street and Bruce Street, cutting through Great Victoria Street.

She was referring to the the three-year collapse of Stormont, which came about in January  when Sinn Fein said it would not go back into an Executivewith the DUP, unless legislation for an Irish language act was implemented, following the DUP and Ms Foster’s handling of the Renewable Heat Incentive scandal.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreAndrew Madden:OpinionElection briefing: From Arlene vs Naomi and election poster fights to the prettiest street in FoyleArlene Foster says ‘all to play for’ in Assembly election even with Sinn Fein ahead in ‘most of the polls’East Belfast Assembly candidate Ms Long replied: “No, it isn#t true, Arlene.

Credit: Claire SugdenNiamh CampbellTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailAssembly candidate Claire Sugden has revealed how she has been working into the wee small hours creating her own election posters, leaflets and social media imagery.Despite having no formal graphics training, the former East Londonderry MLA designs and writes all of her own election material — something she has been doing since she first stood for Stormont six years ago.“It saves me a considerable amount of money and it’s something I enjoy,” explained the independent unionist and former justice minister. “Whenever I was at the age when I was deciding what it was I wanted to do with my le, it was either politics or art. I ended up going down the political route, so it’s kind of nice that when it comes to election times, I can exercise that other side of things.“I have an A-level in art and that’s it. It’s all self-taught. My husband is a computer games artist, so I take a lot of advice from him, but a lot of it is Googling how to do things and, I think, having a bit of an eye for design anyway. None of it is perfect, I’m sure someone who is qualied and experienced in this field would be able to pull up something quicker and a lot more eye-catching, but I’m pleased with the way it turns out.”The Coleraine woman said she spent a few days last week “going round the constituency getting some photographs just to get nice fresh images for the literature”, but overall she’s kept to the same colour scheme and theme for her election content since she first stood in .“It can take a while, but sitting down I can get into a bit of a zone with it. You can find me maybe starting it at pm and still sitting until am in the morning because I’m on a bit of a roll with it. There’s other days when I get a bit of a block and that’s usually the days where you’re under pressure and trying to make deadlines for printers.”She joked: “If the election doesn’t go my way, maybe I have another career!”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Related topicsClaire SugdenMore On Claire Sugden PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseUkraine crisis: Stormont urged to ‘step up’ and pressure Home Office into waiving visa requirement for refugeesSugden’s anger as Stormont crisis endangers mental health court planStaffing crisis in agri-food industry is down to immigration rules, Poots toldIndependent unionist Claire Sugden ‘less likely’ to join UUP following Doug Beattie tweet stormMost ReadArlene Foster accuses Naomi Long and Alliance Party of being ‘nasty’ when ‘mask slips’ in Twitter spatStormont department apologises and drops its legal challenge over whistleblowerLurgan mum diagnosed with cancer in AE told she only had ‘hours to live’Derry Girls premiere: Watch as cast and crew in city for special screening of third seriesBallycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s BayTop VideosPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner Dornan\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRhys McClenaghan becomes new Guinness World Record holderPlayDerry Girls season  premiere: #We#ve shown people another side of Derry#Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Northern Ireland Assembly election : People ‘have a choice’ to attend polling stationCovid positive, Electoral Office confirmsDUP protest over NI Protocol ‘futile’, says Sinn Fein’s Conor MurphyArlene Foster says ‘all to play for’ in Assembly election even with Sinn Fein ahead in ‘most of the polls’Andrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From Arlene vs Naomi and election poster fights to the prettiest street in FoyleAlliance Assembly candidate Connie Egan jokes that vandals of her election posters are ‘terrible’ at artLatestMan pleads guilty to murdering Patrycja Wyrebek in her Co Down homeMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Five deaths and  new cases reportedBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yachtRegeneration plan to be developed for ‘frightening’ Shaftesbury Square in Belfast,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Graham Baalham-CurryApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailYou can’t drink your morning coffee without an audience and as you walk down the road you are watched from all angles, both geometrically and politically.That’s right — election season is upon us and as a result, the faces of your local politicians on poster after poster are becoming more familiar than the heartthrobs we had on our walls as teenagers.It is one staple of election campaigns that has been around for decades,not centuries, and while there’s some sport initially in comparing the tenets of graphic design, colour schemes and haircutsof our political representatives, when you sit and think about it, is this something that’s really needed in this day and age As a journalist, I’m probablymore familiar with Northern Ireland’s politicians than the average person, given my job involves thinking, talking and writing about them on a daily basis. As such, I don’t often need a reminder of who there is to vote for in my constituency or what parties they stand for. I’ll admit that an election poster is certainly an easy way to raise awareness of, on a basic level, exactly who represents or wants to represent you.But after seeing the same person staring at me five times before I had crossed a single bridge in Coleraine where I live the other day, I started to wonder do posters influence how people vote — or are posters just a habit, one which may not serve the most purpose but indicates you have a dog in the fight Read MoreIndependent candidate Claire Sugden using her artistic flair for election materialThe ironic thing is that maybe posters mean much more to the smaller parties and independents with comparably smaller budgets to the more prominent frontrunners. For them, it’s more of a stretch to measure up the level of postering and the legwork it takes displayed by other parties but who worry they won’t get as much attentionthey don’t appear to have parity in terms of faces on streets.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Often described as CorriBoard posters, many of those massive signs you see on our streets and roads are made from one of the dirtiest words of our time — plastic. While the materials can sometimes be upcycled, it is suggested they will take hundreds of years to degrade, long after the politicians whose faces on which they featured and possibly even the parties they represented have departed this fine earth.It’s true that they do have benefits. They are immune to hackers which have plagued recent international elections . Not everyone has top class internet access so it does keep demographics informed. There’s no question that they send a message to voters and a reminder that an election is taking place — andyour local MLA hasn’t fixed that pothole on your road, you will know just the face to ask when they come a-canvassing.Green Party NI politician Mal O’Hara has joined some of his international colleagues in favouring a system seen in Europe where paper posters are erected in certain spaces only, instead of being festooned on every available surface. But this approach isn’t favoured by some larger parties who are able to spread their resources more widely and want to be able to show that. And so, without any wider consensus, the great poster parade marches on even in  when the word on all of our lips is the environment and many of us are kept awake at night wondering what sort of a world it is we’re leaving behind for the next generation and the one after that.What is the alternative  Some may argue it’s already here, and it’s called social media, where most views are shared and heard and your popularity isn’t always just down to what party backs you, but how well you use your voice. There’s also mainstream media via the television, news sites and newspapers as well as the radio. And for those who have access to neither, there’s canvassing — and feel free to reject those shiny leaflets which usually take a short trip to the bin in favour of a chat instead.Or why not make use of the screens in Belfast city centre or in shopping centres to instead display candidates posters on a revolving basis, on the proviso that these screens and devices would have to be made more widely available in our towns and villages Some may disregard these suggestions but surely there must be another way, instead of risking damage to the environment and obscuring our beautul landscape on this island with these massive posters cropping up at regular intervals.Whatever your thoughts on posters, the discourse around them doesn’t end after the election unfortunately. And while you might find the face of a local politician peaking out from behind a hedge or unlucky enough to be placed atop a bonfire, you will also be treated to the crowdsourcing operation that is your local politician asking you to make them aware of any forlorn final poster still lingering on our streets. Or at the very least, a photo of them with clippers in hand, telling all they are out and about removing their posters, sent to the rubbish heap, after election season comes to an end.Related topicsGreen PartyMore On Green PartyClimate Change Bill was ‘not everything’ Green Party leader Clare Bailey hoped for PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatLucidTalk opinion poll: Sinn Fein’s Michelle O’Neill nudges closer to top Stormont post as DUP lags behind PremiumFionola MeredithOpinionWhy there’s no such thing as giving kids a ‘loving smack’Most ReadStormont department apologises and drops its legal challenge over whistleblowerArlene Foster accuses Naomi Long and Alliance Party of being ‘nasty’ when ‘mask slips’ in Twitter spatLurgan mum diagnosed with cancer in AE told she only had ‘hours to live’Ballycastle is Northern Ireland’s best place to live in : Proud locals are in full agreement as Co Antrim town edges out Derry and Helen’s BayDerry Girls premiere: Watch as cast and crew in city for special screening of third seriesTop VideosPlayRaymond O#Neill found guilty of murdering west Belfast mother Jenner Dornan\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph video-news a .ece AUTOCROP wh ccbafcacf.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"PlayRhys McClenaghan becomes new Guinness World Record holderPlayDerry Girls season  premiere: #We#ve shown people another side of Derry#Latest Northern Ireland Assembly election Northern Ireland Assembly election : People ‘have a choice’ to attend polling stationCovid positive, Electoral Office confirmsDUP protest over NI Protocol ‘futile’, says Sinn Fein’s Conor MurphyArlene Foster says ‘all to play for’ in Assembly election even with Sinn Fein ahead in ‘most of the polls’Andrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From Arlene vs Naomi and election poster fights to the prettiest street in FoyleAlliance Assembly candidate Connie Egan jokes that vandals of her election posters are ‘terrible’ at artLatestJohnny McDaid: Shape of You legal battle ‘got really heavy’ and had ‘cost’ to mental healthMan pleads guilty to murdering Patrycja Wyrebek in her Co Down homeMapping coronavirus in Northern Ireland: Covid cases by location and the seven-day rolling averageCoronavirus Northern Ireland: Five deaths and  new cases reportedBelfast-based auction house to sell off drug-smuggling super yacht,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

By working in partnership with Ards and North Down and Newry, Mourne and Down councils, we have an opportunity to develop a sustainable, international walking route, which has the potential to attract visitors, both from home and abroad, to explore our outstanding countryside and learn about our incredible Christian Heritage.Cllr Enright believes that developing a trail of this scale will also encourage walkers to visit existing tourist attractions such as the Livingston Centre at Killinchy Parish Church and stop off on the way in restaurants and stay in local accommodation which in turn will bring much needed income and business to the local economy.Hinch Distillery owner, Dr Terry Cross mdash who set up the David Cross Foundation in memory of his son mdash said he was very impressed with the application for funding from Friends of Columbanus Bangor.ldquoThis project has the ability to bring people from all walks of le to meet and greet one another, regardless of their community background, he enthused.ldquoBuilding relationships, peace and reconciliation across Europe is now more important than ever given the critical situation that has erupted in Ukraine.

However, at the weekend they were determined to not give Armagh a head start and to be as competitive as possible from the first whistle.During a frantic first  minutes the Down girls did not disappoint, fighting for every ball and matching Armagh in every position around the pitch.At the first water-break Down led - to Armagh - in a very even game with Clodagh Simpson scoring a great goal and the lively Orla Owens scoring two points.During the second  minute period of the first half, the Down girls raised their own standard again and pushed Armagh back into their own half.Although Down scored a further - during this period they could have had more, and it was the Armagh team and management who were the happier team to hear the half-time whistle.Scorers in this period were Annie McEvoy with - and Orla Owens again with another point. The half-time score of Down - to Armagh - did certainly not flatter Down as their performance up to then was excellent.Into the second half and Armagh tightened up a lot and restricted Down to less clearer opportunities to score.At the other end Armagh took their own chances and scored a couple of quick goals which gave them the lead for the first time in the match. A point for Owens was the only score for Down during this period.At the second water-break the score was - to - to Armagh.Into the final  minutes and Down made changes to get fresh legs on the pitch. Another Owens point, her fth of the day, levelled up the score at Down - to Armagh - with ten minutes left.Armagh scored two points take the lead for the second time and with time running out, Down went for the goal to win the game.With the ball seemingly stuck in Downrsquos attacking third they just couldnrsquot break down the Armagh defence. With time up Armagh broke up field and scored a goal with the final play to win the match.Full time: Down - Armagh -.The Down girls were disappointed with the result but the management team were delighted with their overall performance.

was free fro structural faults, and had a lespan of  years, explained Mr Smyth.He added that a more recent set of figures, produced by the unit of management on April , indicate that only minor works are needed at the home.ldquoThese latest figures say it would cost pound, to raise the standard at the home, including pound, which would have to be spent on fire safety, said Mr Smyth.ldquoThis patently does not square with the unitrsquos first report, which was used to initiate the consultation process, that it will cost a total of pound, to bring the home up to standard, said Mr Smyth. ldquoThis figure includes pound, for fire safety, pound, for a new roof, pound, for a new electrical system and pound, for a new kitchen.ldquoThese figures are bald figures produced by the unit of management with no specications and without the benefit of a quantity surveyorrsquos report, he added.PORTAFERRY mdash Portaferry has become the first town in Northern Ireland to benefit from a

In the case of Jim Fitzsimons, you can take a man out of Downpatrick, but you canrsquot take Downpatrick out of a man.Jim Fitzsimons was born and reared in Downpatrick. He left the town as a young man, having graduated from Queenrsquos University, and spent the next  years or so in England where he had a successful career in further and higher education and in management training.Jim ed to Northern Ireland  years ago and for eight years lived in a cottage at Inch. Now , he and his we, Anne, live in Hillsborough where they enjoy regular visits from their three sons and seven grandchildren.But the lure of Downpatrick remains strong. When the coronavirus struck in March  and the world went into lockdown, Jim decided that the time was ripe for him to write about the town of his upbringing.The result is My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago, an affectionate account of happy times. For local people of a certain age, it will be a joyous trip down memory lane packed with names and places comfortingly familiar even with the passing of the years. For those who have no connection with Downpatrick, it is a story which is both educational and entertaining.Jim says he is pleased with the outcome of his efforts. ldquoI am very pleased with the book and I certainly enjoyed writing it. Growing up in Downpatrick we were modestly off, but we had all the things that we needed. It was a good place to live.Jim was born in March , six months before the start of the Second World War, the eldest of three children of William Henry Fitzsimons, a bread server, and his we, Marion. He and his younger brother and sister were reared in Saul Street in the warmth of a loving family and surrounded by many friends.He was educated at Fountain Street School and the Southwell School for Boys, where he and his schoolmates trembled in front a ldquosadistic master who ruled with the cane, before enrolling in Down High School in .Outside of school, there were plenty of opportunities to play sport, as well as trips to the cinema, church socials, the Boysrsquo Brigade and dancing. There were holidays at Tyrella, the annual BB camp, Sunday school excursions to Newcastle and trips to Coney Island, Belfast, Warrenpoint and Dundalk, among other places.It was a time when there were no supermarkets and there was an abundance of bread servers. Like his father, Jimrsquos grandfather was also a bread server, as were some of his other relatives. It was a time when bread servers they didnrsquot just serve bread. Butchers and grocers used them for deliveries. They also carried letters and parcels from the countryside to be posted in Downpatrick and also delivered a sizeable quantity of Down Recorders each week. In short, they were something of a social service.Jim writes about helping his father on his bread cart and also his paper round, which ended when he started in high school, collecting scrap metal during the Korean War and then ersying into collecting waste paper before getting a summer job in the County Surveyors Office in Downpatrick before starting university.He also writes about Downpatrick when it was a market town with a monthly fair and a weekly Saturday market. As the county town it had had many government offices and institutions, as well as hospitals and large factories offering plenty of employment, the county courthouse and two grammar schools.The factories have gone and the hospitals are much diminished since Jimrsquos childhood, but the town has grown considerably mdash its postwar population of around , is now over ,.Of Downpatrick then and now, Jim writes: ldquoDownpatrick was small enough to have a village feel about it. I donrsquot think this is still the case. People donrsquot know each other as they did in the past they live less in town centre terraced houses and more in detached houses in the outskirts.ldquoIn the past many men would go to the pub every evening, not to get drunk, but for perhaps a single drink while catching up with all the local news with friends. Going out to public houses is less common now and the public house and other entertainments is not solely for males. Women in the s and s ands were largely unseen, now they are much freer to do and go as they please. In  it was unheard of for a woman to go into a pub.He goes on: ldquoAlthough there is much to regret about the passing of the Downpatrick that I knew, it is a much better place in which to live. The slum houses that I remember are no more there are modern schools, an imposing new technical college with a nearby state-of-the-art fitness centre, a much expanded campus at St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and advanced plans for a new building for Down High School.ldquoDownpatrick has a range of educational, cultural and sporting opportunities for all ages, for those who wish to take advantage of them. All these opportunities define the quality of a town.My Downpatrick: Reflections of  years ago costs pound and is available at the Saint Patrick Centre and the Grove Post Office in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Minister waste treatment refusal is blow for Arc 21  ","story":"THE decision by Stormont Minister Nichola Mallon to refuse permission for a large scale waste treatment facility at the site of a former quarry in Newtownabbey has ramications for Newry, Mourne and Down Council.The local authority is a member of Arc which was seeking permission for the multi-million pound plant which could thermally treat , tonnes of municipal waste each year.Ms Mallon said the incinerator plant, which drew over , objections, could discourage recycling, with her decision due to be discussed at the next meeting of the local councilrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee.Currently, black bin waste collected across the district is transported by sea for incineration in Europe, with council officials keen for the districtrsquos ratepayers to continue focusing their efforts on recycling their waste.There is currently a particular emphasis on ensuring that all food waste is not dumped in black household bins, but in brown bins whose contents is treated and turned into compost.Arc mdash which is considering the decision to refuse permission for the proposed incineration plant mdash is an umbrella waste management group representing six councils on the eastern coast.It was established in  and formally incorporated in  following a process of increasing co-operation amongst its constituent councils.The organisation works on behalf of its partner councils to guide, support and help them deliver their statutory waste management obligations, drive forward innovative waste management programmes, including developing infrastructure and address greater circularity of resources.In addition to Newry, Mourne and Down, the other councils which are members of Arc include Antrim and Newtownabbey, Belfast City, Ards and North Down, Lisburn and Castlereagh and Mid and East Antrim.Ms Mallon said: ldquoI am not persuaded that there is a need for this specic facility.

While I understand that work is underway to recruit new staff, many will be disappointed the museum is closed as it is one of the many jewels in the districtrsquos tourism crown, he said.ldquoTourism is something we do very well in our district, but not opening what is a county museum at this time of year is frustrating and very disappointing.He added: ldquoWe need a fully ing museum in the heart of the county town. The Down County Museum is one of the districtrsquos main attractions and the visitors it draws spend time in Downpatrick and support other businesses, especially those in the hospitality sector which boosts our economy.ldquoGiven tourism is a prime driver for our economy, I am very disappointed that our museum will be shut to visitors over the Easter period and know this view will be shared by many.Alliance councillor Patrick Brown has also criticised the councilrsquos decision to keep the museum closed over Easter.He also called for staff to be moved from Newry to alleviate what he described as ldquostaffing pressures.He said: ldquoI am frustrated to see yet another blow to the Down Museum. Our county museum is so important to the area, and leading into the summer months it should be able to play its essential part in our local tourism industry.ldquoThis is particularly important this year, as we try to bounce back from the pandemic. We have already seen huge controversy over councilrsquos downgrading of the museum, and the news that the museum will remain closed over Easter is very unwelcome.ldquoI, along with other councillors, have secured a full review of museum services across the district as a whole, which is due to start this month.

The team will be announced in due course.Aaron McGrady was in the Peak District along with  other runners for the annual Chicken Run which is a fell race approximately . miles distance and includes , feet of climbing.He had a strong run and placed second overall in a time of .. Aaron was more than happy to be runner-up to the winner Steve Vernon, who is a triple British cross country and mountain running champion ndash He also set the Chicken Run course record in .Steve and Aaron were the only two to break  minutes for the testing course and only nine runners made it home in under the hour so it was a creditable performance from Aaron from all angles.Sunday saw the rescheduled Titanic K. This race was due to take place in  but was called off due to Covid-.At the time a large number of runners deferred their entry to a new date in  but this also fell foul of restrictions at that time so for some runners this was a two year-old ticket.With the ers bolstered by new entrants there were  excited participants in the Harbour Estate ready for action.Paul Lloyd was delighted to finally take to the roads in a race as he has been hampered by a long term injury and has only managed a modicum of training.He last raced in June  so it was a long time coming.He finished in . which placed him th overall. This is a good marker for further improvement as he s to previous form and he commented on how good it felt to be back at a mass participation event. Hopefully he will now feel ready to enter more races in the near future.Manchester MarathonAs anyone who has done a marathon will know, the preparation required is gruelling. Most runners start months in advance and gradually increase their mileage so that they have the stamina to cope comfortably with . miles.They also need to include speed workthey want to set a good time so it is a juggling process.Gordy Graham, coached by Ryan Maxwell, had followed his schedule to the letter and had many promising race results in his build up so it was a hammer blow when he developed a knee injury with only three weeks to go.He eased off the miles in the hope that it would settle and right up to the morning of the marathon, he was debating whether racing was in his best interests.This head versus heart is not a new thing to runners. With the hours spent training for that day, sitting it out would have been too much to bear.In the end he set off with equal amounts of hope and caution and for the first hour or so maintained the pace that he needed to match his . personal best set in Belfast last year.He was in a group banging out miles at an incredible . minutes per mile pace and he felt pretty good until mile .At this point the niggle became enough to disrupt his natural rhythm and as a result his pace wavered. However, true to form he persisted to the line recording .. as he passed the tape.This result is one that would cause celebration for most and it is, in fact, his second fastest marathon but for Gordy there is still a time out there that he wants to achieve and we know that when he has assessed and treated his injury, he will be back pushing for his goal.We wish him luck in his recovery and future endeavours.Hannah Somani was also out chasing specic targets firstly to better her time of . which she set in London Marathon last October and secondly to come home in under three hours. This sub-three barrier is regarded as a holy grail for many and for Hannah being so close on in London was enough to convince her to give it another shot.She continued consistent training throughout the autumn and into the winter with multiple sessions per week as well as long runs at weekends.On her recent trip to Downpatrick she was so committed to the plan that she ran -odd miles on the morning of Jimmyrsquos Ten before heading to the start line.She then went on to run quick enough in the K to lead with two other high performing EDAC ladiestoclinch victory in the team competition.All this must have stood her in good stead as she absolutely nailed it on Sunday. She arrived at the start with quiet resolve and executed her race with precision pacing.Her time of .. was well deserved after her hard work and she was naturally over the moon. Super work, Hannah.Steph Graham was equally determined in her approach. A small matter of a wedding and a baby in the last  months might seem reason to hold back from committing to race targets but when your husband is also your coach then the lines become blurred.Gordy has had prior mention above for his own race but Steph would be quick to acknowledge his part in her achievements. She entered Manchester due largely to his encouragement as she had doubts as to whether she would be ready in time.She had been hacking chunks off her marathon times in the last few years and in Berlin  she ran . so sub . was her aim. This was a big ask as training with a young baby is never easy but she pulled it off with style.Gordy was brimming over with pride when she finished in ... Steph deserves kudos for this performance but even more so for the fact that she had to resort to the treadmill for daily miles.Despite the tedium of running miles looking at a wall, she never missed a session and her hard graft has paid off. What a team.Same distance but dferent city ndash Dee Murray had decided that Paris in the spring would provide the incentive to train over the winter months and he had racked up his miles motivated by excitement of a European marathon.The day dawned bright but chilly and it took a bit of effort to get warm enough to shed the layers before the start.Fortunately once they were lined up on the famous Champs Elyseacutees, the sun came out in fulland the , runners had perfect racing conditions for the rest of the day.Dee ran with his usual metronomic rhythm ticking off the miles and the iconic landmarks as he ran the winding route.Apart from a bit of cramp in the last couple of miles, he felt comfortable and was delighted to get a sub three hour finish in .. shaving a few seconds off his previous best which had held since .Dee is known as lsquoMr Consistentrsquo and running as quickly as he did five years ago endorses that nickname no end. It is also worth a mention that he placed a commendable , out of ,. A good job well done.With the racing season in full flow, EDAC club members were quick to get signed up on the recent membership night so that they can keep training and also avail of the club discount when entering races.They might also have been encouraged by the raffle which was held at the sign-up.

These cars were very reliable, always came with a full service history and low mileage. Many an auction night was filled with many young buyers rubbing shoulders with car traders trying to grab themselves a good deal.The DLVA has now prevented these private buyers taking part in these auctions and have stipulated that these DLA car auctions are now trade only. This in turn is pushing these private buyers instead onto the garage or traders forecourt where the same car they could have bought at auction is now two or three thousand pounds higher because of the traders premium. The traders are also seeing more demand and thus can push the prices up.The taxpayer is losing out, those DLA cars would be getting better auction pricesthe number of buyers was not restricted and thus less funds are going back into the government.The cost of motoring is a big part of the overall cost of living crisis. Families can no longer afford to purchase second hand cars. The government should not be taking measures that puts even more pressure on those badly affected.John McSorley, Belfast BT"},{"url":null,"title":"the dup has talked tough about sinn fein in previous elections too ","story":"NI Protocol: EU agrees ‘indefinite’ exclusion of border checks for GB medicines coming into Northern Ireland   Loyalist Communities Council boss: I would call an Irish unity poll tomorrowI could – because unionism just won’t loseNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraineSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes  Gardense-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionThe DUP has talked tough about Sinn Fein in previous elections tooA letter from George FD Young:By LettersFriday, th April , : am  \"       \"  Letter to the editorAs we can see, talking tough at election time is easy for the DUP, but finding matching actions thereafter is more dficult.In the last, as in this one, the DUP solicited votes on this same tough anti-Sinn Fein ticket.

Normally our big strength is that you can clearly see what we try to do and that was not the case.“That was a big problem, the rhythm, the repetition of our attacks, the discipline, positionally in attack.“And that was a big disadvantage in counter pressing because we were not in the spaces we need to be. vw,vw,px, px\"Tuchel says his side lacked intensity in their defending “We lacked intensity and investment in defending.

How we respond to Russia’s invasion will define the international order for years to come. We cannot let Putin’s crimes go unpunished.”It comes as the Foreign Office targeted the daughters of Russian President Vladimir Putin and foreign minister Sergei Lavrov with sanctions.A statement said it was aiming to hit the “lavish lestyles of the Kremlin’s inner circle”.It said: “Katerina Vladimirovna Tikhonova and Maria Vladimirovna Vorontsova, the daughters of President Putin, and Yekaterina Sergeyevna Vinokurova, daughter of foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, will be subject to travel bans and asset freezes.”Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss joined international condemnation of the rocket strike on a railway station in Kramatorsk, in eastern Ukraine, that president Volodymyr Zelensky said killed around  people and injured  more.“Appalled by the horric reports of Russian rocket attacks on civilians at Kramatorsk railway station in Eastern Ukraine,” she tweeted.“The targeting of civilians is a war crime. We will hold Russia and Putin to account.”Earlier, Ms Truss, after a meeting of Nato counterparts in Brussels on Thursday, said she hoped to see “more countries” commit to banning Russian energy imports.The UK has pledged to end all imports of Russian coal and oil by the end of , with gas to follow as soon as possible..removeAlso on Thursday, the European Union said members had agreed to new sanctions that included an embargo on Russian coal imports.Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has pushed for foreign leaders to go further on cutting ties with the Kremlin.“As long as the West continues buying Russian gas and oil it is supporting Ukraine with one hand while supporting the Russian war machine with another hand,” he said in Brussels.He took particular umbrage with Germany, urging it to cut red tape and speed up support to Ukraine.“While Berlin has time, Kyiv doesn’t,” Mr Kuleba said.Positive momentum at @NATO.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityFrom ice cream cone creations to vegan and gluten-free chocolate, I wanted to see which Aldi products are genuinely worth buying and whether the more luxurious, grand designs were good value.I must place a disclaimer here, I am a big fan of simple eggs made with tasty, good quality chocolate.For me, it isnt about novelty designs, chocolate shards spiking out and the price tags to match.So when I took a look at Aldis Easter selection, I decided my mission was to find an egg that looks great but tastes even better.One product that really intrigued me was Dairyfines chocolate ice cream egg- a blonde chocolate and wafer cone topped with a milk chocolate scoop, finished with mini eggs and biscuit crumb, as well as a popping candy cone base.Resembling the popular Cornetto ice cream, I was genuinely amazed by the attention to detail when I reached the end of the cone and discovered chocolate-covered popping candy and milk chocolate.It was a real treat to eat and I think Id have been bouncing off the walls in joy I received this as a kid.The one thing that really struck me about Aldis Easter egg offering was the effective use of recyclable materials, leaving you guilt-free when it comes to packaging. Not even the ice cream egg was covered in excess single-use plastic.The cone tasted almost like Caramac -thats a sweet up your street, this is the egg for you. The dferent combinations of chocolate and salty biscuit crumbs sprinkled on top left my sweet tooth feeling more than satisfied.  With the chocolate ice cream egg, you really have a bit of everything and I think its a worthwhile purchase.Salted caramel Easter eggsThere is one major theme in Aldis Easter egg and chocolate collection for : salted caramel. .removeSome of Aldis salted caramel options, pictured. I recruited a salted caramel expert, otherwise known as my boyfriend, to help review the full salted caramel selection. I thought salted caramel was something that didnt really y in quality - yet some of these eggs really stood out as the best. In my humble opinion, one of the best chocolate eggs from Aldi is the Moser Roth salted caramel egg  with hidden truffles, part of the Free From range.Despite not containing milk, egg, wheat and gluten, it gives out little bursts of salted caramel flavours with every bite and it wasnt overly rich. It would have been easy to eat the whole egg in one sitting, not to mention the tempting truffles hiding inside the box. For serious salted caramel fans, the ChocoChanger salted caramel eggis the choice to go for.From the moment you open the box, a strong aroma of caramel jumps out while the chocolate pops with creamy, salty sweetness.One of the more surprising salted caramel items was the rich, vegan, dark Belgian chocolate office bunnies- you couldnt have too many but one every so often would really hit the spot.Moser Roths luxury egg box from Aldi. If salted caramel is your idea of heaven, Id definitely recommend heading to Aldi for a browse. One of the most delicious chocolate treats from Aldi was the indulgent assortment of hand decorated chocolate eggs  with dferent types of fillings.From dark chocolate orange and speculoos to pistachio and macadamia, these chocolates are definitely ones youll struggle not to eat in one go. The flavours really worked well together - an ideal choice for people who love dferent types of chocolate and something visually appealing. One tasted like sticky toffee pudding while the raspberry chocolate had such delicate berry hints - absolutely perfect.Hazelnut filled eggs and hazelnut chocolate rabbits from Aldi. Now Im not the biggest hazelnut fan but Aldi has played an absolute blinder with this flavour in .Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny  leaves you with no words, just \"Mmmm\". Adorned with a cute green bow and bunny charm, the bunny looked great and tasted even better than you could expect.The smooth chocolate melts in your mouth while the hazelnut really hits the spot. If you love Ferrero Rocher, you need to try Aldis mouthwatering crispy hazelnut luxury filled eggs .A mix between Nutella and Ferrero Rocher, these chocolate eggs have a biscuity yet smooth texture with a gorgeous nutty aftertaste. Meanwhile, the Moser Roth Belgian milk and dark chocolate almond eggwas something unique, featuring salted almond butter.The combination of sweet yet salty almond butter with two types of chocolate was well balanced - though it did have a strong aftertaste, meaning its not one for those who can take or leave almond.There was just one Easter egg which left me wanting a little bit more than I got: the Dairyfine Chunky Egg Fruit and Nut .This chocolate egg is described as a thick Belgian milk chocolate egg packed with fruit and nut pieces - a combination Ive been known to enjoy.The chocolate didnt taste as special while the nuts were rather small and didnt have the crunch I yearned for. Saying that, it might be down to personal choice and you could completely disagree.The verdict: Which Aldi chocolate Easter eggs are worth buying From the selection I tried, there are three clear winners: Moser Roths hazelnut chocolate bunny, Moser Roths Free From salted caramel egg with hidden truffles and the Dairyfine chocolate ice cream egg.You can browse the full Easter egg collection from Aldi via the website hereThe Aldi website has even more eggs on offer - featuring cookies and cream, Eton mess and chocolate orange flavours"},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/national/uk-today/20048484.aldi-lidl-middle-aisles-thursday/res","title":"aldi lidl middle aisles thursday","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

Each autumn, Jays, a colourful member of the crow family, can often be seen flying back and forth finding and hiding acorns to help see them through the winter. These are then hidden in the cracks and crevices of trees, but also in leaf litter on the ground. An inidual jay can store around , acorns each year and many remain buried to grow into oak trees.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Mother and her daughter counting birds in their garden, Bedford, UK, January The RSPB’s Chief Executive, Beccy Speight said “We don’t know the reasons for the sudden increase in Jay sightings this year. It may be down to food availability as we have reports that last year was poor for acorns, but whatever the reason a sighting of this stunning bird is enough to raise one’s spirits any day of the year let alone on a gloomy January weekend.“It’s been brilliant to see so many people taking part again this year, taking time out to watch and reconnect with birds and then generously submit their sightings to help RSPB scientists gain some insights into how our garden birds are faring.”Big Garden Birdwatch results also found a small increase in Greenfinch compared to . This gives scientists a glimmer of hope that this might be the first signs of a popuation recovery, but only time will tell. In recent years the Greenfinch has suffered a population crashcaused by a severe outbreak of the disease trichomonosis and as a consequence the species was added to the UK Red list last year. This infection is spread through contaminated food and drinking water, or by birds feeding one another with regurgitated food during the breeding season. Garden owners can help slow transmission rates by temporarily stopping the provision of foodill birds are seen and making sure that garden bird feeders are cleaned regularly.The House Sparrow remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings as the most commonly seen garden bird with more than . million recorded sightings throughout the weekend. Blue Tit and Starling remained in the number two and three positions respectively.RSPB Big Garden Birdwatch. Family filling up a bird feeder in their garden, Potton, Bedfordshire, UK, January Over its four decades, Big Garden Birdwatch has highlighted the winners and losers in the garden bird world. It was first to alert the RSPB to the decline in song thrush numbers, which are still down % compared to the first Big Garden Birdwatch in . This species was a firm fixture in the top  in . By , its numbers were less than half those recorded in , it came in at  in the rankings this year, seen in just % of gardens.Throughout the first half of the spring term the nation’s school children took part in the RSPB’s Big Schools Birdwatch.

Woodpigeon was the most numerous species seen with an average of eight per school and was seen in % of all schools that took part. Blackbird was a close second with an average of seven per school.Beccy added: “Connecting with nature doesn’t have to stop with Big Garden Birdwatch.

That and the mural were my two moments,” she said.The story follows a group of teenagers growing up in Northern Ireland in the s, around the time of the IRA and loyalist ceasefires.While the Troubles was an inescapable backdrop, the micro-dramas of teenagers navigating their parents, parties, love interests and school captured the attention of audiences far beyond Irish shores.Saoirse-Monica puts the success of the show entirely down to McGee and says she hopes that now the show has come to an end, that they can work again together in the future.“I’m very sad that its coming to an end,” she said. “It’s been the most amazing experience of my le. “But I don’t think it’s over, over because it will always be with us.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures larne music festival returns after two year absence ","story":"Newtownabbey PSNI arrest man on suspicion of assault and theft   Two people rushed to hospital after crash at Rushmere roundabout in CraigavonNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeopleThe committee of Larne Music Festival has thanked all who supported and attended this year.

Whilst Joe has always had a passion for cycling, his motivation to compete in his first endurance cycling race in  was in honour of his son and to raise funds for Daisy Lodge.Against the odds, in , Ross got to celebrate his second birthday, having been diagnosed at just five months old with a malignant brain tumour. Following numerous rounds of treatment, he is now a thriving  year old.Joe Barr is aiming to raise much-needed funds for a new cancer respite centre in Co. Mayo.In the early years of Ross’s cancer diagnosis, he and his family were invited to Cancer Fund for Children’s short break centre in Newcastle for some much-needed respite from the constant hospital appointments, tests and treatments and all that goes with a cancer diagnosis in a family. “Every family in Ireland with a cancer diagnosis should have the opportunity to experience Daisy Lodge, It’s a fantastic place,” says Joe. “Whenever you go down there, they just do everything for you - so, effectively, it’s a home from home and it allowed us to be together as a ‘normal’ family again and that’s why I’m so motivated to raise as much funds as I can to support the new Daisy Lodge set to be built in Cong, Co. Mayo.”Joe retired from professional cycling in  but got back on the bike in  to fundraise for Ross and, more than ten years later, is still going strong. He has competed in numerous endurance races around the world including the + mile Race Across America. He has won the ,-mile Race Around Ireland twice and holds multiple endurance world records in Ireland. This -day Highest Mileage Guinness World Record will be his most ambitious record attempt and will take in the very challenging cross Ireland route of Malin Head to Mizen Head - three times!The planned centre in Mayo is inspired by Daisy Lodge in Co. Down which currently supports  families a year.For more information about Cancer Fund for Children, go to www.cancerfundforchildren.Joe BarrIreland  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularTributes to Portadown student Lee Usher who died in Cookstow...NewsR driver facing court after being caught doing mph...NewsPolice advise of closure of Lisburn’s Moira Road...NewsPolice release photo of Portadown man Lee Usher killed in cr...NewsMan who pointed ‘gun’ at person in Larne ‘lucky’ not to have...NewsMost PopularStylish armchairs UK: where to buy great living room chairs,...RecommendedThird boutique proves they CAN!...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

These will be taken in conjunction with GMB who also represents bus workers at Translink. The strike action planned will be a week, starting April  and concluding on May , as well as a single day on Friday, May . The strike comes after members of the union overwhelmingly voted for industrial action after rejecting the latest Translink management pay offer. Unite general secretary Sharon Graham expressed her support for the striking bus workers. She said, “These bus workers are frontline workers – they deserve respect and a pay increase. Translink needs to grasp that there’s a cost of living crisis destroying the value of wages andwith a more acceptable offer. “Unite’s members have my full support and that of their union in taking this strike action for fairer pay.” Unite deputy Regional Secretary Davy Thompson is lead officer for Translink, Northern Ireland’s bus and rail public transport provider. He added:“Unite represents the overwhelming majority of bus workers, and this strike action taken in conjunction with GMB which also represents bus workers will shut down all bus services. “Bus workers deserve a pay increase. The ball is in the court of Translink management. They can to avoid this unnecessary and highly disruptive strike – they need to address our members’ legitimate pay expectations.” Meanwhile, Peter Macklin, GMB Organiser, said:Every worker deserves fair pay. With rampant inflation, this real terms cut is a slap in the face and will leave many struggling to cover their bills. “Translinkfails to recognise what workers went through during the pandemic. “They kept transport running so other essential workers could get to and from workplaces to perform vital roles. “Our members were proud to carry out their duty in delivering the service, potentially putting themselves and their families at risk. When we clapped every Thursday night, we said the essential workers would not be forgotten or left behind. But during this cost of living crisis, Translink is forgetting their own workers. “The dispute, which affects bus drivers, cleaners and shunters will close the entire bus network within Northern Ireland. It will be a complete shutdown.” A Translink spokesperson said they were disappointed that the unions hadvoted to take industrial action. “Following extensive negotiations, including with the Labour Relations Agency, we made a pay offer of % plus an enhanced package of conditions that included a % increase in weekend and overtime rates along with  extra days holiday, they said. “We believe this was a fair and reasonable offer and have at all times been open to discussions. We remain committed to working with the unions to avert this action. “We would welcome the opportunity to engage with unions to cover school duties, so that the wellbeing of schoolchildren can remain a priority. “All train services will continue to operate as normal. “We will communicate relevant passenger information through the media, on our website www.translink, through social media, in stations and on buses and trains. “Translink apologises for any inconvenience this may cause”.  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bdfcbefa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bacfeacdcfa   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
