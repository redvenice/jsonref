At the same time, the volume of disinformation from doctored photos to false rumours and hoax videos spreading online has grown at a worrying pace.In etymological terms, the word “viral” comes from the stem word “virus”. And the viral misinformation can be a danger in itself. Just think of the recent petrol bomb attacks on 5G phone masts because of a widely believed – but unfounded – link to coronavirus.There’s so much noise on social media that false theories are easily spread: whether that’s forwarding an email attachment containing a computer virus without reading it properly, or sharing a faked photo because you’re in a rush.The claim: “5G mobile phone towers emit radiation that attacks the immune system, thus affecting those vulnerable to the coronavirus.”The truth: There is no evidence that 5G weakens immune systems or is harmful to humans, with international radiation experts reminding us that Covid-19 has spread in many countries that don’t have the high-speed phone system, such as Iran. The cause of the disease is still unknown, but appears to have started in a Wuhan food market where wild animals were illegally traded.See also: Other false claims about the causes of coronavirus, such as eating bat soup a manmade bioweapon for population control and fortune cookies.If in doubt ... Don’t trust information on social media if you don’t know where it came from one video claimed new £20 notes show symbols of 5G towers, and dozens of phone masts have been vandalised, including one serving Birmingham’s NHS Nightingale hospital. If a cause is confirmed, it’ll appear in reports issued by the World Health Organization (WHO). Rather than trusting celebrities or influencers, try Googling the information to see whether trusted sources such as reputable news organisations like the BBC or the  have reported it.The claim: “Gargling water mixed with salt or vinegar can wipe out coronavirus.” Or so a post shared many times on email and WhatsApp tells us, often accompanied with information that “holding your breath for 10 seconds can prove there’s no fibrosis in the lungs”.The truth: At present there is no cure or treatment for Covid-19.See also: Bogus claims that coronavirus can be cured or prevented by: oregano oil, lemon juice, sunbathing, using vodka as hand sanitiser, or drinking bleach.If in doubt ... Check the latest advice on the NHS website, the WHO website or the Q\u0026ampA page on the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.The claim: In March, a photo emerged on social media purporting to show troops clad in army fatigues walking around London’s Clapham Junction. Many wrongly interpreted this as evidence that the military had been deployed to ensure people stayed home.The truth: The “soldiers” were actually students at a nearby military preparation college and had nothing to do with Covid-19, something confirmed by the Ministry of Defence and the college.See also: Other fabricated photos and videos, such as footage of a man in Wales wiping his hands on a public lift (actually filmed in Bangkok), or the picture of worshippers crowded outside a mosque (taken before lockdown, 23 March).If in doubt: Remember that many doctored photos and videos, plus images with misleading captions, exist online. You can trace the possible source of the photo with a simple image search online.What’s happening: Despite global demand for face masks, a quick online search reveals vendors apparently offering to sell protective gear in bulk.The truth: Hundreds of bogus websites have been set up by criminals since the crisis began, many claiming to have face masks for sale. Police recently revealed British firms and iniduals have lost more than £1.86m to coronavirus-related fraud from bogus companies with no intention of selling masks.See also: The websites recently caught selling fake hand sanitisers or unregistered coronavirus testing kits - another scam.If in doubt ... Never purchase anything from an unverified website - check the padlock symbol in the address bar that indicates a secure connection and report any misleading websites, emails or text messages you think may be suspicious.The claim: “The government has been sending texts alerting people that they’ve been fined for ignoring social distancing measures during lockdown.” For example, one text reads: “You have been out of your house three times today, you are in breach of government guidelines. Your £30 fine will automatically be added to your bill.” A link leads to a non-governmental website asking for bank details.The truth: Hackers have spied an opportunity in the many people working from home, attempting to access their networks or steal login and password details. Up to 21 April, Action Fraud had received more than 1,000 coronavirus- related reports, with losses topping £2.3m.See also: Any email that asks you for personal information such as passwords or credit card details.If in doubt ...

That cynical image of humanity has been proclaimed in films and novels, history books and scientific research. But in the last 20 years, something extraordinary has happened. Scientists from all over the world have switched to a more hopeful view of mankind. This development is still so young that researchers in different fields often don’t even know about each other.When I started writing a book about this more hopeful view, I knew there was one story I would have to address. It takes place on a deserted island somewhere in the Pacific. A plane has just gone down. The only survivors are some British schoolboys, who can’t believe their good fortune. Nothing but beach, shells and water for miles. And better yet: no grownups.On the very first day, the boys institute a democracy of sorts. One boy, Ralph, is elected to be the group’s leader. Athletic, charismatic and handsome, his game plan is simple: 1) Have fun. 2) Survive. 3) Make smoke signals for passing ships. Number one is a success. The others? Not so much. The boys are more interested in feasting and frolicking than in tending the fire. Before long, they have begun painting their faces. Casting off their clothes. And they develop overpowering urges – to pinch, to kick, to bite. By the time a British naval officer comes ashore, the island is a smouldering wasteland. Three of the children are dead. “I should have thought,” the officer says, “that a pack of British boys would have been able to put up a better show than that.” At this, Ralph bursts into tears. “Ralph wept for the end of innocence,” we read, and for “the darkness of man’s heart”.This story never happened. An English schoolmaster, William Golding, made up this story in 1951 – his novel Lord of the Flies would sell tens of millions of copies, be translated into more than 30 languages and hailed as one of the classics of the 20th century. In hindsight, the secret to the book’s success is clear. Golding had a masterful ability to portray the darkest depths of mankind. Of course, he had the zeitgeist of the 1960s on his side, when a new generation was questioning its parents about the atrocities of the second world war. Had Auschwitz been an anomaly, they wanted to know, or is there a Nazi hiding in each of us?I first read Lord of the Flies as a teenager. I remember feeling disillusioned afterwards, but not for a second did I think to doubt Golding’s view of human nature. That didn’t happen until years later when I began delving into the author’s life. I learned what an unhappy inidual he had been: an alcoholic, prone to depression a man who beat his kids. “I have always understood the Nazis,” Golding confessed, “because I am of that sort by nature.” And it was “partly out of that sad self-knowledge” that he wrote Lord of the Flies.I began to wonder: had anyone ever studied what real children would do if they found themselves alone on a deserted island? I wrote an article on the subject, in which I compared Lord of the Flies to modern scientific insights and concluded that, in all probability, kids would act very differently. Readers responded sceptically. All my examples concerned kids at home, at school, or at summer camp. Thus began my quest for a real-life Lord of the Flies. After trawling the web for a while, I came across an obscure blog that told an arresting story: “One day, in 1977, six boys set out from Tonga on a fishing trip ... Caught in a huge storm, the boys were shipwrecked on a deserted island. What do they do, this little tribe? They made a pact never to quarrel.”The article did not provide any sources. But sometimes all it takes is a stroke of luck. Sifting through a newspaper archive one day, I typed a year incorrectly and there it was. The reference to 1977 turned out to have been a typo. In the 6 October 1966 edition of Australian newspaper The Age, a headline jumped out at me: “Sunday showing for Tongan castaways”. The story concerned six boys who had been found three weeks earlier on a rocky islet south of Tonga, an island group in the Pacific Ocean. The boys had been rescued by an Australian sea captain after being marooned on the island of ‘Ata for more than a year. According to the article, the captain had even got a television station to film a re-enactment of the boys’ adventure.I was bursting with questions. Were the boys still alive? And could I find the television footage? Most importantly, though, I had a lead: the captain’s name was Peter Warner. When I searched for him, I had another stroke of luck. In a recent issue of a tiny local paper from Mackay, Australia, I came across the headline: “Mates share 50-year bond”. Printed alongside was a small photograph of two men, smiling, one with his arm slung around the other. The article began: “Deep in a banana plantation at Tullera, near Lismore, sit an unlikely pair of mates ... The elder is 83 years old, the son of a wealthy industrialist. The younger, 67, was, literally, a child of nature.” Their names? Peter Warner and Mano Totau. And where had they met? On a deserted island.My wife Maartje and I rented a car in Brisbane and some three hours later arrived at our destination, a spot in the middle of nowhere that stumped Google Maps. Yet there he was, sitting out in front of a low-slung house off the dirt road: the man who rescued six lost boys 50 years ago, Captain Peter Warner.Peter was the youngest son of Arthur Warner, once one of the richest and most powerful men in Australia. Back in the 1930s, Arthur ruled over a vast empire called Electronic Industries, which dominated the country’s radio market at the time. Peter was groomed to follow in his father’s footsteps. Instead, at the age of 17, he ran away to sea in search of adventure and spent the next few years sailing from Hong Kong to Stockholm, Shanghai to St Petersburg. When he finally returned five years later, the prodigal son proudly presented his father with a Swedish captain’s certificate. Unimpressed, Warner Sr demanded his son learn a useful profession. “What’s easiest?” Peter asked. “Accountancy,” Arthur lied.Peter went to work for his father’s company, yet the sea still beckoned, and whenever he could he went to Tasmania, where he kept his own fishing fleet. It was this that brought him to Tonga in the winter of 1966. On the way home he took a little detour and that’s when he saw it: a minuscule island in the azure sea, ‘Ata. The island had been inhabited once, until one dark day in 1863, when a slave ship appeared on the horizon and sailed off with the natives. Since then, ‘Ata had been deserted – cursed and forgotten.But Peter noticed something odd. Peering through his binoculars, he saw burned patches on the green cliffs. “In the tropics it’s unusual for fires to start spontaneously,” he told us, a half century later. Then he saw a boy. Naked. Hair down to his shoulders. This wild creature leaped from the cliffside and plunged into the water. Suddenly more boys followed, screaming at the top of their lungs. It didn’t take long for the first boy to reach the boat. “My name is Stephen,” he cried in perfect English. “There are six of us and we reckon we’ve been here 15 months.”The boys, once aboard, claimed they were students at a boarding school in Nuku‘alofa, the Tongan capital. Sick of school meals, they had decided to take a fishing boat out one day, only to get caught in a storm. Likely story, Peter thought. Using his two-way radio, he called in to Nuku‘alofa. “I’ve got six kids here,” he told the operator. “Stand by,” came the response. Twenty minutes ticked by. (As Peter tells this part of the story, he gets a little misty-eyed.) Finally, a very tearful operator came on the radio, and said: “You found them! These boys have been given up for dead. Funerals have been held. If it’s them, this is a miracle!”In the months that followed I tried to reconstruct as precisely as possible what had happened on ‘Ata. Peter’s memory turned out to be excellent. Even at the age of 90, everything he recounted was consistent with my foremost other source, Mano, 15 years old at the time and now pushing 70, who lived just a few hours’ drive from him. The real Lord of the Flies, Mano told us, began in June 1965. The protagonists were six boys – Sione, Stephen, Kolo, David, Luke and Mano – all pupils at a strict Catholic boarding school in Nuku‘alofa. The oldest was 16, the youngest 13, and they had one main thing in common: they were bored witless. So they came up with a plan to escape: to Fiji, some 500 miles away, or even all the way to New Zealand. There was only one obstacle. None of them owned a boat, so they decided to “borrow” one from Mr Taniela Uhila, a fisherman they all disliked. The boys took little time to prepare for the voyage. Two sacks of bananas, a few coconuts and a small gas burner were all the supplies they packed. It didn’t occur to any of them to bring a map, let alone a compass.No one noticed the small craft leaving the harbour that evening. Skies were fair only a mild breeze ruffled the calm sea. But that night the boys made a grave error. They fell asleep. A few hours later they awoke to water crashing down over their heads. It was dark. They hoisted the sail, which the wind promptly tore to shreds. Next to break was the rudder. “We drifted for eight days,” Mano told me. “Without food. Without water.” The boys tried catching fish. They managed to collect some rainwater in hollowed-out coconut shells and shared it equally between them, each taking a sip in the morning and another in the evening. Then, on the eighth day, they spied a miracle on the horizon. A small island, to be precise. Not a tropical paradise with waving palm trees and sandy beaches, but a hulking mass of rock, jutting up more than a thousand feet out of the ocean. These days, ‘Ata is considered uninhabitable. But “by the time we arrived,” Captain Warner wrote in his memoirs, “the boys had set up a small commune with food garden, hollowed-out tree trunks to store rainwater, a gymnasium with curious weights, a badminton court, chicken pens and a permanent fire, all from handiwork, an old knife blade and much determination.” While the boys in Lord of the Flies come to blows over the fire, those in this real-life version tended their flame so it never went out, for more than a year.The kids agreed to work in teams of two, drawing up a strict roster for garden, kitchen and guard duty. Sometimes they quarrelled, but whenever that happened they solved it by imposing a time-out. Their days began and ended with song and prayer. Kolo fashioned a makeshift guitar from a piece of driftwood, half a coconut shell and six steel wires salvaged from their wrecked boat – an instrument Peter has kept all these years – and played it to help lift their spirits. And their spirits needed lifting. All summer long it hardly rained, driving the boys frantic with thirst. They tried constructing a raft in order to leave the island, but it fell apart in the crashing surf. Worst of all, Stephen slipped one day, fell off a cliff and broke his leg. The other boys picked their way down after him and then helped him back up to the top. They set his leg using sticks and leaves. “Don’t worry,” Sione joked. “We’ll do your work, while you lie there like King Taufa‘ahau Tupou himself!”They survived initially on fish, coconuts, tame birds (they drank the blood as well as eating the meat) seabird eggs were sucked dry. Later, when they got to the top of the island, they found an ancient volcanic crater, where people had lived a century before. There the boys discovered wild taro, bananas and chickens (which had been reproducing for the 100 years since the last Tongans had left). They were finally rescued on Sunday 11 September 1966. The local physician later expressed astonishment at their muscled physiques and Stephen’s perfectly healed leg. But this wasn’t the end of the boys’ little adventure, because, when they arrived back in Nuku‘alofa police boarded Peter’s boat, arrested the boys and threw them in jail. Mr Taniela Uhila, whose sailing boat the boys had “borrowed” 15 months earlier, was still furious, and he’d decided to press charges.Fortunately for the boys, Peter came up with a plan. It occurred to him that the story of their shipwreck was perfect Hollywood material. And being his father’s corporate accountant, Peter managed the company’s film rights and knew people in TV. So from Tonga, he called up the manager of Channel 7 in Sydney. “You can have the Australian rights,” he told them. “Give me the world rights.” Next, Peter paid Mr Uhila £150 for his old boat, and got the boys released on condition that they would cooperate with the movie. A few days later, a team from Channel 7 arrived. The mood when the boys returned to their families in Tonga was jubilant. Almost the entire island of Haʻafeva – population 900 – had turned out to welcome them home. Peter was proclaimed a national hero. Soon he received a message from King Taufa‘ahau Tupou IV himself, inviting the captain for an audience. “Thank you for rescuing six of my subjects,” His Royal Highness said. “Now, is there anything I can do for you?” The captain didn’t have to think long. “Yes! I would like to trap lobster in these waters and start a business here.” The king consented. Peter returned to Sydney, resigned from his father’s company and commissioned a new ship. Then he had the six boys brought over and granted them the thing that had started it all: an opportunity to see the world beyond Tonga. He hired them as the crew of his new fishing boat. While the boys of ‘Ata have been consigned to obscurity, Golding’s book is still widely read. Media historians even credit him as being the unwitting originator of one of the most popular entertainment genres on television today: reality TV. “I read and reread Lord of the Flies ,” ulged the creator of hit series Survivor in an interview.It’s time we told a different kind of story. The real Lord of the Flies is a tale of friendship and loyalty one that illustrates how much stronger we are if we can lean on each other. After my wife took Peter’s picture, he turned to a cabinet and rummaged around for a bit, then drew out a heavy stack of papers that he laid in my hands. His memoirs, he explained, written for his children and grandchildren. I looked down at the first page. “Life has taught me a great deal,” it began, “including the lesson that you should always look for what is good and positive in people.”• This is an adapted excerpt from Rutger Bregman’s Humankind, translated by Elizabeth Manton and Erica Moore.

But many of those attempting to buy a home in London might interpret that same image as – how shall we put this? – slightly less heroic.As Foxtons operates in London, which has largely been a sellers’ market for decades, these differing views of its frontline workers may be the inevitable function of supply and demand.Yet the perception that the company employs punchy dealmakers is also perhaps one of the firm’s main selling points to customers (people who have houses to sell or let). It is also possibly why the company modelled its image on a cocky young gang on the make, deploying a fleet of branded Minis to zip around the capital in an unashamed hat tip to the 1969 heist film The Italian Job.Now, a bit like the film’s fictional heroes escaping Turin, this team of brash youthful Londoners must navigate their way through the seemingly impassable gridlock of the Covid-19 economy – a theme that will be much in evidence this week as Foxtons holds its AGM.The 2020 gathering will, of course, differ from the norm – and not just because it will have to be conducted remotely. Astonishingly, the AGM looks unlikely to host the usual scrap over executive pay, which just goes to show how the coronavirus pandemic has blown the doors off old certainties.Still, while the general market is clearly in turmoil and Foxtons looks sure to be hit, it is still a large and relatively well-funded player in what remains a very fragmented market. Smaller chains of estate agents seem to be facing even more challenges, and many large rivals still need to devise escape routes.Foxtons’ shares are, in effect, always a punt on the London housing market – which has been off-colour ever since the Brexit vote – and so holding them (even at these low levels) is an act of faith. But there will come a time when another sharp-suited salesperson, this time in the City, will sniff a commission and attempt to persuade investors that the firm is not about to fall off a cliff. “Hang on a minute, lads,” he will inevitably say. “I’ve got a great idea.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/190455bca0bb93cda8957b0399102ae2e2fc5c14/39_0_3391_2036/master/3391.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf686d988bd2d01c23be5824b4016233","title":"lloyds rushes to fix flaw that stopped firms receiving covid loans","story":"Exclusive: UK subsidiary caught in bank’s tangle over government-backed loansLloyds Banking Group is rushing to fix a fault that left subsidiaries of foreign companies struggling for weeks to gain access to UK government-backed loans during the coronavirus crisis.In order to qualify for Cbils – which is aimed at small and medium-sized firms that conduct most of their business in the UK – a company’s annual revenue cannot top £45m. However, local subsidiaries have to count their entire group’s turnover when applying for the scheme.That was one of the major hurdles that Milton Keynes-based steel product manufacturer Sikla UK faced when it approached Lloyds for a £250,000 emergency loan in March.Harry Starke, the managing director of the Austrian-owned firm, said he was initially caught out by the bank’s demand for a personal guarantee, which only company owners would usually provide. Rishi Sunak eventually banned personal guarantees following a public backlash, but Starke found the firm was barred due to the Cbils revenue calculation that counted his £5m turnover firm as a £140m-a-year business.He eventually held out for the government’s new Clbils programme for larger firms, which came with less generous terms. Personal guarantees could also be requested on loans above £250,000.But when the scheme went live, Starke’s account manager within the Lloyds small and medium-sized business ision could not gain access to the larger scheme. Only clients in its commercial ision meant for bigger corporate customers could apply.Starke told the  he wasted hours trying to apply for the scheme and wished Lloyds had been transparent about counting group turnover from the start. He has been waiting six weeks for funding.Lloyds acknowledged the issue, but insisted only a limited number of businesses had been caught out by the issue. It is understood a workaround could be in place as early as next week.A Lloyds spokesman said: “For a very limited number of SMEs, who are part of a wider group of companies where the combined turnover is over £45m, they may be eligible for Clbils rather than Cbils. We are liaising with those customers to ensure we can provide the finance they need as quickly as possible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37d1c4e943b83292bac53c14abad16a544c34524/0_296_5249_3150/master/5249.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ddaca2649063c7922d235593f9fea244","title":"coronavirus crafting sewn up creative calamity","story":"With a lockdown boom in wholesomely mindful hobbies, I had a go myself. My stress levels quickly went through the roofOf all of the strange side effects of the pandemic, I suppose the craft boom was inevitable. The mindfulness industry (which goes hand in hand with sewing, knitting and the like) was already thriving before lockdown sent our levels of boredom and anxiety through the roof. Now, we’re seeing something of a craft renaissance: John Lewis’s haberdashery sales have reported an online boost, while Hobbycraft, that stalwart of the craft-industrial complex, has said the number of people visiting its website for crafting ideas has tripled since the lockdown began. For every sourdough starter, there’s also a handmade face mask or a piece of Tiger King-inspired embroidery.It’s not difficult to see why people turn to crafts in times of crisis. During a particularly potent spell of unemployment in my early 20s, I took to making little people out of tampons. It started when, unable to sleep one night, I gathered up all the “crafting” materials I could find in my room (some felt tips and a box of Tampax) and turned five tampons into the Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico. This was, it should be said, in the wake of the twee-core explosion of the late 2000s, when doing this sort of thing was considered Zooey Deschanel-esque, and therefore good.Until now, this was my last memorable episode of adult crafting. As a mild dyspraxic, I’ve never been particularly good at anything involving fine motor skills. My movements are both frantic and indecisive, like a ham descending a staircase. The idea of me sitting down to embroider is about as reasonable as the idea of Donald Trump sitting down to read Infinite Jest. But here I am holding something called an embroidery hoop. Having watched the same YouTube instructional video three times, I’ve managed to fit said hoop with a piece of fabric bearing an intricate floral template.On opening up my embroidery kit (which, by the way, had a photo of a child on the packaging) I was nearly overcome by panic. The different coloured threads hung next to one another, on the same piece of card. There was a weird clippy tool I’d never seen before. And one brief look at the instructions told me they’d been run (possibly from Mandarin, going by some Chinese characters on the packaging) through Google translate, which only served to exacerbate my confusion. If it weren’t for the glut of calming “how to” videos on embroidery (many of which have been uploaded over the past few weeks) I would’ve been tempted to dump the entire kit in the bin and put the ordeal behind me before it had even started.Admittedly, the first stitch I sew is quite satisfying. I use some of the green thread to make a start on a flower stem, and am frankly awed by my own ability. But before long, it dawns on me just how slow this process is: it has taken me about 15 minutes to do an inch of stem and one tiny leaf. My mind wanders. I’m bored. Had I been born hundreds of years ago, I think to myself, this is probably what I would’ve done (as a lesbian) to avoid contact with my rank, toothless, clap-infested husband. I would’ve sat embroidering poorly by candlelight, thinking impure thoughts about wenches. Maybe this is why lesbians are so into crafting: it’s a throwback to the days when they channelled all the sadness of forbidden desire into quietly subversive needlework.But having decided embroidery is emphatically not for me, I move onto modelling clay. Dyspraxic or not, I loved this stuff as a kid, and have warm memories of making animals, vegetables and minerals that inevitably fell apart in the oven. I roll out some balls and make colourful, abstract models. The polymer clay is satisfying to mould and play with, especially for someone given to nervous fidgeting. But after about 10 minutes, my hands feel dried out and achy, and I’m desperate to scroll Twitter, check the news and go back to my usual soothing activity of watching back-to-back Simpsons episodes.But I will myself to try one last craft. YouTube informs me that, using just cardboard toilet-paper rolls and paint, of which I happen to have both, I can make quite handsome little dandelion prints. Of all crafts I’ve attempted, this seems by far the easiest. You just cut strips into the toilet roll, splay them out and use the end product as a kind of fat paint brush. You’d have to be a mandrill to balls this up.Reader, I balls it up. There’s green and orange paint (the only colours I have) everywhere. My “painting” looks like something a nursery school teacher would think twice about before sticking up on the classroom wall. It’s an unmitigated disaster. I stand up and look at my war zone of a table, strewn with paint, loose pieces of thread and multicoloured clay crumbs. I can’t deal with this right now, I think to myself. I’m too stressed. And for the endless “bits and bobs” that come with crafting, my lockdown household has become all the more claustrophobic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4d3bfcba152a70a6481501680b236ade1fed2e27/0_30_1476_886/master/1476.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=48b0f7b348d24862952bab3e9341e08d","title":"enter baby boris or to give him his full name","story":"A beleaguered Britain bids a heartfelt hello to the perfect distraction from the handling of the coronavirusWe do not even know exactly how many children the prime minister has, for example, or by whom. Such gentlemanly discretion, in the social media age of self-promotional disclosure, is much to be admired, like a rose blooming in some discarded shit-pants. Indeed, despite the fact that, by his own admission, he is “literally bursting with spunk”, the prime minister manages his family affairs, and those of his totty, with almost monastic privacy, the Pope John XII of modern politics. Turds may have taken technology lessons from a pole dancer, or he may not have done. But he was not cynical enough to try and exploit this, and the exciting photo opportunities the encounters would doubtless have provided, perhaps of the PM hanging comically from the pole in some kind of harness and waving a flag, for self-publicity or political gain.But advisers in Turds’s inner circle know that the birth of his baby could have been the ultimate dead cat on the table, perfect to distract from questions relating to the government’s handling of the coronavirus. After all, it does not now appear that the coronavirus will just go away if you simply ignore it like an annoying wasp at a picnic, as was originally thought. Britain now has the highest coronavirus death rate of any European country, and unpatriotic critics are already trying to connect this data, in some way, to the government’s response to the crisis, as if they were somehow related.Misdirection abounds. The Daily Mail hate-funnel and cognitive dissonance practitioner Sarah Vine has already suggested that, in order to troll woke snowflakes and easily offended liberals, Turds’s child should be christened entirely with the names of writers found on the shelves of her, and her resentful orphan husband Michael Gove’s, assiduously curated Black Library of forbidden, obscene, amoral and decadent books.But would Carrie Symonds have consented, even at the insistence of the government’s new dead-cat-deployer Ben Warner, to allow her firstborn, as Vine suggested, to be christened David-Irving Charles-Murray Douglas-Murray Ayn-Rand Richard-Allen Adolf-Hitler Marquis-de-Sade Lord-Horror Osama-Bin-Laden Bobby-Seale Bobby-Sands Michael-Gove Neil-Strauss John-Norman Graham-Kerr Nancy-Friday Abdul-Alhazred Gilles-de-Rais Nigel-Rees Enid-Blyton Sofie-Hagen S-Clay-Wilson Captain-Pissgums Ernest-Dowson Leopold-von-Sacher-Masoch Delia-Smith William-Johnson-Cory Aleister-Crowley Olympia-Press Etonensis Johnson?Did Vine share photographs of her offensively non-alphabetised library of offence without thought, or as an outright act of provocation? Or was it as a cheery dog -whistle to supporters of the far right, who may be losing faith in the xenophobic certainties of Brexit now their lives have been saved by immigrant key workers? If only a few members of the notoriously antisemitic Labour party had shown the same initiative to share shots of their similarly controversial book collections, perhaps they would be doing better in the polls.The birth of the prime minister’s child during the crisis serves in some way to normalise him. Parents all across the land ache for the life experiences already lost by their children under lockdown. On the first Monday of next month, under normal circumstances, we would have been in Gloucestershire as usual, watching people fall to almost certain injury down a near-vertical cliff in pursuit of a 9lb piece of cheese, with our children, Keira (9) and Starmer (13). But not this year.Cheese has fallen down a Gloucestershire cliff every Whit Monday or so since before the birth of Christ. And before cows were domesticated, fungus-fuelled Cotswold shamans would merely stare at a space where they knew that a falling cheese, whatever that was, would one day be. But this spring bank holiday, the crowds will not make their unregulated pilgrimage across the hills to the quasi-illegal ritual. I hope some local hero rolls the cheese anyway, late at night by moonlight, so that the world keeps turning. Some semblance of cosmic order must be maintained in the face of this invisible enemy which you couldn’t really have seen coming even though everyone said it was and we really needed to get our shit together like fast man.Pressure is on the PM to act decisively, or at least do something else significant, so no one notices that he didn’t. Though an uncommonly dignified Turds has made few public pronouncements on the recent birth of his newly born son, he has finally succumbed to political pressure to announce, that in the traditional Johnson family manner going back to the days of the Ottoman empire, his new baby will take four of his own personal names, while retaining all of his father’s."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aa6b99a37609cad8580c3d9cdf36f5c48baf175/0_89_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c421ff2dd3aecd62f8be859b2b67c208","title":"the observer view on the governments lack of a proper lockdown plan","story":"Ministers’ shambolic briefings expose a terrifying lack of competence‘In spite of the sunny bank holiday, it is vitally important that we continue to abide by the current restrictions: stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.” That was the message delivered by the environment secretary, George Eustice, at Friday afternoon’s press conference. Yet just the day before, most newspapers were emblazoned with excited headlines foretelling a significant relaxation of social distancing restrictions, based on briefing from government sources: “Lockdown freedom beckons”, “First steps to freedom from Monday” and “Stay home advice to be scrapped”.Despite the critical importance of clear public messaging to any public health strategy, the government’s communications have been marred by mixed messages throughout this deadly pandemic. Its core message, asking the public to stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives, has been very effective, but this has consistently been undermined by ministers and advisers inaccurately briefing the press that there is about to be a shift in policy. Before the Easter weekend, reports appeared that ministers thought that the public had been too obedient in following the lockdown, and that a relaxation was imminent. The same happened before this bank holiday weekend, forcing the government to clarify that there was no change in restrictions and that people must continue to abide by the law.The tone of these briefings has been shockingly out of step with reality. Last week, the UK’s official death toll overtook Italy’s to make us the worst-hit country in Europe at this point (the UK’s official statistics capture a smaller proportion of excess deaths than in many other European countries, suggesting that, if anything, the UK will look worse as the death toll becomes more accurate). Every day, hundreds of families lose their loved ones to this virus, healthcare workers put their lives at risk by going to work without adequate protection, and care homes struggle to manage the spread of the disease among residents. As a result of high levels of public compliance with the lockdown, infection rates have fallen, but not to a point where there can be any significant relaxation of social distancing: the measures that will be announced later today will rightly be very incremental.It beggars belief that government sources have, regardless, been briefing that the end of lockdown is nigh, and floating, then stepping back from, major policy changes – such as the potential for households to mix in closed groups of up to 10 people. It is a recipe for sowing confusion and seeding a laidback approach to social distancing. New policy should be announced only to parliament or at the daily press conference. We can only hope that the public continues to listen to and comply with social distancing, despite the government’s unclear messages.These shambolic communications are a sign of a worrying lack of competence at the heart of government. Bombastic war metaphors are being used as a substitute for long-term strategy. The government’s success in rapidly expanding NHS critical care capacity has not been matched in other areas, from ensuring adequate supplies of protective equipment for frontline workers, to delays in expanding testing capacity, to the disaster that is unfolding in many care homes.The government has consistently faced calls from the opposition and scientific experts to be more transparent about how it intends to relax social distancing restrictions without triggering a second wave of deaths later in the year. Any significant relaxation of the lockdown is contingent not just on getting infection rates lower but on having adequate testing and tracing capacity to quickly identify and isolate new outbreaks.Yet the government has failed to publish a proper strategy. It has adopted arbitrary testing targets: first a quarter of a million tests a day, then 100,000, and now 200,000, without explaining how these targets fit into a strategy for managing future outbreaks. It manipulated testing figures – sending out a large number of tests post on one particular day, and counting these as completed tests – in order to meet its arbitrary 100,000 target, which it has since fallen back from. It would make more sense to adopt a dynamic target that aims to keep the proportion of tests that come back positive below a fixed figure: this would help ensure that we are testing in sufficient numbers given the incidence of the virus. We do not know what assumptions the government is relying upon for example, how quickly test results will need to be turned around to feed into an effective track and trace system.In terms of tracing, experience from countries such as Singapore suggests that technology and contact tracing apps can only assist, not replace, teams of human contact tracers. Yet there are worrying signs the UK may be relying too heavily on the development of an app, with all the privacy concerns that this involves, and not enough on building skilled teams of contact tracers. While it has committed to recruiting 18,000 contact tracers by the middle of this month, this may not be enough, and it emerged last week that the government is in talks with large private-sector contractors to provide 15,000 call-centre staff, who would have only a day’s training. One company is Serco, which was last year fined £23m by the Serious Fraud Office over its delivery of electronic tagging contracts. Meanwhile, it is unclear if and how the government intends to deploy the thousands of environmental health officers who work for local councils it has been far too slow to involve local government public health experts in other areas, for example testing in care homes.This is the most difficult governing challenge the country has faced in decades the gaps in our knowledge about this virus means that there is often uncertainty as to the best way forward. It would be unreasonable to expect a government to make no missteps. Yet the evidence is mounting that this government’s rank incompetence has contributed to the terrible numbers of deaths of recent weeks. This cannot wait for a post-hoc public inquiry: ministers have to face up to and learn from their mistakes in the here and now. People’s lives depend on it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92c5dfbe29a8ed6af88a661cb194348f15781e64/0_311_5760_3455/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f1dafaae491dbe7c89ab5c37d22902e8","title":"janey godley i translate the news into what politicians are actually saying","story":"The Glaswegian comedian’s voiceover videos are a lockdown hit – not least with Nicola SturgeonJaney Godley is having a productive lockdown. The 59-year-old comedian has had a run of viral (in the good sense) hits with her sweary and very funny voiceovers, typically overdubs of recent press briefings given by Nicola Sturgeon, Boris Johnson and Donald Trump. A former pub landlady, Godley became a standup comic at the age of 35, and her material often references her early experienceof violence and abuse. She lives in her native Glasgow and records near-daily Facebook Live updates and podcasts from the flat she shares with her husband, their daughter – the comedian Ashley Storrie – and dachshund Honey.Why are people responding to your voiceovers?I think because we’ve become so exhausted by looking at the news. You see Boris talking, you see Nicola Sturgeon talking, and you could turn the volume down and not learn anything more. So I just translate it into what they’re actually saying. And that is: “Shut the fuck up, stop moaning, stay in the house, wash your hands, and if I see any of you then I’m going to give you a kick up the crack of your arse.”Have you ever met Nicola Sturgeon?Yeah, she stood up at an event I was at and said, “If you want to know what I’m really thinking, watch Janey Godley voiceovers.”Does it feel weird that she likes them?Yeah, but if she puts a foot wrong she’ll get it in the neck as well, because although I am an SNP supporter, ultimately I’m a satirist.In 2016 you turned up at Turnberry, Donald Trump’s golf course, with a sign that read “Trump is a cunt.” Did you expect that to become a news event?No, I had absolutely no idea. But it turns out I was right, eh?You’re very natural on your Facebook Lives and podcasts – on stage too. How much preparation do you do?There’s no prep. I’m the most unprofessional arsehole you’ve ever met! I think it’s not being a career comedian. I never had a plan. I was never good at schmoozing. I mean, 20 years at the Edinburgh fringe and I still can’t tell you who the TV people are and who the reviewers are. I’m really mistrusting of people and, believe it or not, I’m monumentally shy. I was never good at that “Hey, Steve Wilson, Channel 4, Janey Godley here, I’ve got some ideas!” I’d rather fucking eat a hammer than do that.How much of a blow – personally or for the industry – is the cancellation of the Edinburgh fringe this year?You have to look at all the small theatres that are going to close. Not the Edinburgh fringe – we’ll all not fucking die by not doing the fringe. Most comedians go there and lose money anyhow. Small theatres, and the small communities, they will suffer the longevity of this.You’ve had to cancel gigs – are you losing out financially?People are being so kind and I’m selling my merch a lot, I’m selling my cards and my books. But I’m really lucky because I’m not crippled by poverty now. I know what poverty is and it’s not this.When you started doing comedy, Stewart Lee gave you some advice – what did he say?I was just doing like jokey-jokey things way back in the early-mid 1990s, and I remember I was telling Stewart Lee a funny story off stage and he looked at me and went: “Oh my God, why are you doing that on stage when you have this?”What was the story?It was a whole big story about the night my husband parked on the zigzag lines – he was only on the zigzag line for a second – and the police came and charged him. Then we went to court and it turns out the policeman was actually a policeman who the last time I saw him was in the stripper club in Glasgow while I was doing comedy there. And they said to me: “Have you ever seen this police officer before?” And I went, “Yeah, the last time I saw him he was trying to eat a finger of Fudge out of a stripper’s vagina in a nightclub.” So I told that story and then I thought, “I’ve got hundreds of these stories, why have I never told them?” That’s what changed it.Are there any similarities between running a pub and doing comedy?Oh yeah, it’s a transferable skill, totally. I used to do Jongleurs, the hen nights, the stag nights, and comedians would be shaking in their boots and I’m like: “Fuck, this is a Tuesday to me, are you kidding? I had a guy hold a knife at my neck on a Monday morning. This is fuck all!”Do you miss live audiences?Oh my God, I’m desperate for a live audience! The day I get out on stage, I’m going to piss all over it with excitement like a big Alsatian dog that’s not had a piss for a week. No, I’m sick of talking to my fucking self to camera. I want to talk to people. I want to go out there in front of people and then not speak to them afterwards."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/99faeacac3f664910c7b35d6e585561096715acf/0_14_2939_1764/master/2939.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=124ef7e125415e0c9d07163d36704f07","title":"lockdown diary self isolating covid 19 coronavirus","story":"Like man buns on scooters and ukulele busking, Covid-19 has now spread to the north from London – inspiring a coronavirus soapcom from our self-isolating comedy-writerUp here in the north-west, we’re used to living in the slipstream of London’s sleek urban shenanigans.

The pharmacy alone remained accessible, fulfilling some holy destiny: “Ha!

One day: jammed full of punters transmitting respiratory bonhomie in the micro-atmosphere. The next: dark.Well, we’ve finally caught up with The News: “More people are in hospital with coronavirus in the north-west of England than in London.” That’s just because the capital peaked earlier, like it did with house prices and halloumi burgers.

Zoom-crossed lovers tumble into a synced, tragicomic ketamine binge. A bitter feud simmers between a trapped adulterous scientific adviser and a deeply religious Iceland delivery guy. A sobbing pub landlord FaceTimes his former regulars at closing time, calling for last orders. A Street Stranger Watch leads to a death, possibly two, and the shocking appearance at midnight of all the street’s original Victorian inhabitants. An IT consultant and her laptop swap memories, then the computer runs a diagnostic on the consultant and, uh-oh, she needs new “software”. A teen romance is conducted entirely in sub-tweets. A sinister WhatsApp group sends users far back in time to December 2019. All elements of the natural world, from starlings to potted geraniums, acquire the power of human speech. Sarcastic bears appear. A 10-year-old maths genius makes first subatomic contact with “Hancock”, leader of the Coronavirus Proteins, before a truce is declared and the proteins settle in their new home, an AI wet-market simulator. There’s a massive street party with bunting and trifle, the group dance routine to Bohemian Rhapsody goes viral on TikTok, AND THEN we get the reveal that this has all been a fever dream in the mind of a prime minister on a ventilator.Yeah, feet up now. Just checking the inbox, baby. Just checking the inbox.Of course, some people are experiencing personal hells trapped inside. But outside, the “not many people about” is nice, yeah? The “very few cars” is pretty good, no? It would be funny if the solution to crowded commutes and clogged roads turned out to be nationalised railways, unionised home-working and fewer people travelling.Back in the last century, the second biggest question* concerned the economics of a post-industrial society.

Alas, robots turned out to be bad – either in league with humourless cryptic anarchists, or just taking jobs.But maybe these weird times have shown us that the answers to “What are we for?” and “Where are the jobs?” are the same. Health. Care. Looking after one another, better. The sector is woefully under-resourced and there’s a rapidly expanding user base.

I don’t mind if they are on space hoppers as long as it’s not by car. You need to reduce the amount of traffic to allow pupils and parents to walk safely.”Norman said there would be an added danger to parents and children who would have to keep two metres apart if the roads were busy near schools. “The last thing we want is kids and their parents stepping into a busy road or to see increasing air quality problems around schools.Transport planners are worried that if more people opt to use their cars after the lockdown ends, to get children to and from school, there will be gridlock in urban areas. They also warn that there will be a rapid rise in pollution levels around schools that will be bad for pupils’ and teachers’ health.A national cycling plan will be published in early June to help double cycling and increase walking by 2025, he said. Measures will include pop-up bike lanes and wider pavements as well as cycle and bus-only streets. Trials of e-scooters will also be fast-tracked in a bid to get rental schemes up and running in cities as fast as possible.The length of time that temporary road closures around schools would last, and precisely how they work, will be left up to local councils. But both London mayor Sadiq Khan and the mayor of Greater Manchester, have made clear money will be available and emergency powers can be used to allow them to do so.They say the closures would also make it safer for people to walk or cycle at safe distances from each other en route to and from schools, and help buses carrying children avoid running into heavy congestion.Chris Boardman, the former Olympic cycling gold medallist, who is now cycling and walking commissioner for Greater Manchester, said the current crisis had created a unique opportunity to try out ideas that people might find they want to adopt permanently.Every year more than 200 million car journeys of less than 1km are made, many of these being on school runs.Graham Stapleton, the CEO of retail chain Halfords, said he supported calls by Boardman for trials on e-scooters.“We welcome reports of a forthcoming government announcement on fast tracking e-scooter trials and think if this is true, it will go some way to setting a legal and regulatory framework that means they can be lawfully used on our roads. There is overwhelming public support for trials.”Khan said: “To help mitigate the impact of a greatly reduced capacity on public transport, due to social distancing, we will need millions of journeys a day to be made by other means. If people switch only a fraction of these journeys to cars, London risks grinding to a halt, air quality will worsen, and road danger will increase.“Modelling has shown that there is potential for a tenfold increase in kilometres cycled and up to five times the amount of walking. Our Streetspace plan will act as a catalyst for this change, fast-tracking schemes that will enable many more people to take to two wheels or travel on foot. This includes repurposing traffic lanes on main roads for temporary cycle lanes, widening footways so that people can safely socially distance, looking at where we need to restrict roads to buses and bikes only at certain times of the day, and reducing traffic on residential streets.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4aca71f0d91dcebf529defbb1331b7ce799bc18/27_218_1209_725/master/1209.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c0ca3f2d19e4cffa353ad3ee097b6aa","title":"fox","story":"Campaigners call for return of 1930s wording to Twentieth Century Fox Film Co former officesDisney, titan of the media and entertainment world, has enraged a group of Londoners attempting to preserve one of Soho’s best-known squares. And the battle is over one word: “Fox”.In the south-west corner of Soho Square stands Twentieth Century House, a grand emblem of the American film industry’s key role in this part of the city since 1937. It is now in the hands of Disney.This week The Soho Society, which campaigns for the conservation of the area, has called on Disney to replace the historic lettering on the portico, removed some time last month. The sign said Twentieth Century Fox Film Co Ltd.One of the missing words, “Fox”, completes the famous title of the old Hollywood studio giant, but now also signifies an American news channel that no longer has a financial connection to the film company, or with Disney.Disney does, however, own Twentieth Century Television, and the old sign may have value for that reason.“What we seem to have here is an unseemly tussle involving the names of media monoliths,” said Tim Lord, chair of The Soho Society this weekend. “The removal of the brass serif lettering, however it happened, has left damage to the front of the building.”Disney has been in charge of the building for a year, since its purchase of Twentieth Century Fox’s assets. Disney rents the building from Royal London, but a letter seen by the Observer makes it clear the property company had not given consent for Disney to remove the lettering.“Royal London had received a list of elements the tenant has wanted to take with them (including the lettering) on departure, but their exit from the building has not yet been agreeddocumented. The tenant has therefore acted without permission to remove these items,” the letter reads.Royal London has contacted Disney’s leasing agency to raise its own concerns, it claims, and Disney has indicated it is looking into the matter.“The future of Soho is under threat in many ways in this current crisis, with all its restaurants and bars closed,” said Lord. “Which is why we remain particularly concerned to protect its built history and heritage.” Last year Royal London applied to demolish the building, but it has since agreed to retain part of the facade.

Toast to sneak under a mound of mushrooms fried in butter and thyme. And, using up the weekend roast, toast to cushion a sauce made with leftover chicken, browned onions, sage and cream. Best of all was a blue cheese sauce, properly made with bay-infused milk into which I folded steamed spinach and fat butter beans from a tin.Toast has been a lockdown go-to partly for its ability to make a light dish more substantial. The trusty crust that sits under a piece of grilled lamb belly or roasted red peppers and soaks up their garlicky, herby juices. The thickly cut chewy bread that lends heft to a light lunch of taglierini, basil and crushed tomatoes, or acts as a delicious raft on which to sit a vast, wobbling spoonful of parmesan soufflé.This is “bought bread” of course, not being able to get my hands on enough flour to knock up a loaf of my own. I managed to get a panettone, too – and thank goodness that this vanilla-scented cake has become available year-round. As good as the soft, fruit-flecked dough can be, I do prefer it toasted, especially when I have sandwiched two thin slices together with apricot jam or some skinny matchsticks of dark chocolate. As the cake toasts on the griddle, the filling melts and oozes from the edges. A jug of cream wouldn’t go amiss, or even a scoop of lightly melting ice-cream.Enough for 3onions 2, medium olive oil 2 tbspbutter 30gspinach 200gmilk 500mlblack peppercorns 6bay leaves 2plain flour 45gblue cheese 100g, such as Shropshire Blue, Stichelton, etc butter beans 1 x 400g tintoast 6 slicesFor the pickled onions:red onion ½white wine vinegar 100mlwater 50mlblack peppercorns 8salt 1 tspcaster sugar 1 tspStart with the pickled onion. Peel and thinly slice the red onion and put it in a non-reactive saucepan with the vinegar, water, whole peppercorns, salt and sugar. Bring to the boil, check that the sugar has dissolved, then remove from the heat and set aside. Over the next half hour or so, the onion will become softer and less pungent, but retain a little of its original crispness.Peel and roughly chop the 2 onions, then put them into a deep saucepan with the olive oil and butter and place over a low to moderate heat. Let the onions cook, with the occasional stir, for a good 15-20 minutes until deep gold and translucent.Wash the spinach and remove any tough stalks. Put the still-wet leaves into a saucepan, place over a high heat and cover tightly with a lid. Leave the spinach to cook for a couple of minutes in its own steam, turn once or twice with tongs, then remove from the heat when the leaves are deep green and wilted. Tip into a colander and rinse under cold water, then squeeze out most of the water with your hands.Bring the milk, whole peppercorns and bay leaves to the boil in a small, deep saucepan, then set aside to infuse.Stir the flour into the softened onions, continue cooking for a minute or two, then stir in the milk, a ladle at a time, discarding the aromatics as you go. Stir the sauce to remove any lumps, then leave to simmer over a low heat for 10 minutes, continuing to stir from time to time.Crumble the cheese into the sauce, taste, then add ground black pepper to taste. Rinse the butter beans and add them to the sauce, then stir in the spinach. Place the slices of toast on a baking sheet and set the oven grill to high. Divide the beans between the slices of toast, then leave under the grill until patchily golden. Top with red onion slices, lifted from the pickle, and eat immediately.The panettone browns quickly so keep the heat low in order to give the chocolate time to melt. Press the top half on firmly to keep the chocolate in place. Turning the sandwich on the griddle gets easier after the first attempt. I use two palette knives, one under the sandwich, the other holding the top in place. It takes a little practice. A little sharp fruit jam, such as morello cherry or apricot, is rather good here, as would be a little bowl of very softly whipped cream. Enough for 3panettone 6 thin slices, less than 40g eachdark chocolate 80gicing sugar a littleCut each panettone slice in half. Cut the chocolate into short, thin shards, about the thickness of a match and scatter them thickly over one half of each slice. Place the second half on top to make a small sandwich and press firmly down.Place a ridged griddle pan or heavy-based frying pan over a low to moderate heat. Lower the sandwiches on to the surface and, keeping the heat low, leave to toast for a minute or two until the chocolate has melted. Watch carefully, as this really doesn’t take very long.Slide a palette knife under the sandwich and, holding the top piece in place, quickly turn to lightly brown the other side. Toast for a further minute or 2, dust very lightly with icing sugar and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e37ca1152f598d467bc8cf8a6899530f7951b95/0_94_4756_2854/master/4756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=000f3cbc8954369f0a3d5e15e571b7e0","title":"brighton restart covid 19 premier league","story":"A third Brighton and Hove Albion player has tested positive for coronavirus, the club’s chief executive has said.Paul Barber confirmed that the unnamed player had been sent home and instructed to isolate for 14 days. The news comes a day before clubs are to meet to discuss proposals for a potential restart of the Premier League.“Unfortunately we have had a third player test positive just yesterday,” Barber told Sky Sports News. “Despite all the measures we have all been taking over the last few weeks, when the players haven’t been involved in taking any significant training at all, we have still suffered another player testing positive for the virus.”Two Brighton players tested positive for Covid-19 earlier during the pandemic, though both have since recovered. The club reopened their training facilities at the end of April, but only for solo activities with most players continuing to train at home.The Seagulls, who were 15th in the league when football was suspended, have been one of the clubs most willing to speak openly about their concerns over coronavirus and its impact on the game.The club have been accused of acting in its own interests, a charge Barber did not deny. “At this stage of the season there is self-interest at every level of the table,” he said. “There is as much self-interest at the top as there is at the bottom, there is as much self-interest in the middle as there is at the bottom. Everyone has different objectives for the season and we are all looking to play out the season, if it is safe to do so.“We really do want to play and we want to make sure the competition stays as fair as it can be despite these exceptional circumstances that we are facing.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b304847d89f80ef8dcadcc16c5d74e64cbf3f7b9/175_36_2070_1242/master/2070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d12e67ca0fe0c3f1f6c65359526140c","title":"players guinea pigs would wipe out premier league integrity","story":"The final league table will merit the biggest asterisk in history if teams are full of footballers who don’t want to be on the pitchAnyone who has spent the best part of an hour just waiting to cross a supermarket threshold in the past few weeks will be aware how quickly the outlandish becomes the new normal. Yet even in these strange days it was still odd to hear Gordon Taylor pop up on the radio with the suggestion that shortened games might be the solution to finishing the Premier League season sometime before the clocks go back.How that would have helped maintain the integrity of the competition or assisted those clubs worried they might be relegated in less than optimum circumstances remained unclear, for the Premier League was pooh-poohing the idea proposed by the Professional Footballers’ Association’s leader as ridiculous and unfounded within hours.Like the equally baffling brainwave of suspending relegation so clubs in the bottom half of the table might feel more comfortable when playing their must-win games behind closed doors at neutral venues, there appeared to be no logic to the proposal and neither could any cogent sponsor be found to argue its merits. The idea was just put out there, kicked around for a short while, and then left to join herd immunity and too-hurriedly imported face masks in Covid-19’s unvisited museum of false hope and empty promises.Taking relegation off the table will not be under discussion when the 20 Premier League clubs hold their conference call on Monday, and no time will be spent talking about finishing the season in five-a-side format, either, though what we might hear a lot about in the next few days, and what Taylor’s remark may have alluded to, is the ppetite among players for a return to full-scale football.The Premier League may want the season concluded for contractual reasons, the clubs quite naturally need to know where they stand and whether seeking legal advice might be a wise precaution, but the players are at the pointy end of all the deliberations. Though their opinions have not yet been canvassed or conveyed, there is at least a suspicion that not everyone is happy with being rushed back at the earliest opportunity.No one has so far said the players resent being used as guinea pigs for the rest of society, yet given that physical distancing will be observed at stadiums though impossible on the pitch, this may be a real concern. Top-flight football in this country disappeared overnight because of Mikel Arteta reporting a positive coronavirus test. Now clubs are being told they need not shut down their operations if a single player tests positive. As long as distancing and hygiene precautions are in place they can carry on preparing for games, though it is still to be explained how games themselves can proceed in such circumstances. A cultural change around training grounds is one thing, but actual games, with actual consequences like relegation or survival riding on their outcome, cannot be controlled in the same way as supermarket queues.Some players appear to be more worried than others and, with football being as demanding as it is, that may amount to an injury-type situation for managers. Not only would it be impossible and unreasonable to make someone play against his will, a player might put his hand up for selection yet still find himself subconsciously guarded or hesitant once on the pitch. Football as we used to know it generally proceeded without too much mental turmoil on the part of the performers, yet even in normal times managers would quickly withdraw distracted players, often citing “his head wasn’t in the right place” as the reason. This is not football as we used to know it, quite clearly. Chris Wilder has just said he would respect the wishes of any of his Sheffield United players who wanted to opt out of games.It would be surprising if similar conversations leading to similar conclusions have not been held at every club in the country. Whatever the aim of restarting the season in sterile conditions behind closed doors, in these circumstances it cannot be maintaining sporting integrity.Without even going into the possibilities of what sort of teams might be fielded by clubs with no further interest in the season, or with a preference for ending the season without playing any more games, the final league table would merit the biggest asterisk in history. This is the season, the record books would explain, when the first 29 matches were accomplished using players who wanted to play every minute of every game, while the final nine rounds featured players who did not want to play at all.It may not come to that. The Premier League will be guided by what happens in other countries such as Germany, as well as police and health advice here. But after what may be a fractious discussion between clubs ided about how the season should play out, it has also agreed to take the concerns of the players on board.So it should, for if Project Restart is to work, and for all the obstacles in its way it still might, it will need positivity and unanimity. Everyone must agree on the same objective and the right way to bring it about. It will require selflessness, in other words. The Premier League has never previously been noted for anything of the sort, but we are living through strange days. There is always the possibility of a first time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e06b51429a66ca514214df0e2f8504b7310635a/0_0_8525_5115/master/8525.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6c1abce408cf069503c50ec1a7f413","title":"no posh bread no fancy cheese and certainly no mayo the seven unwritten rules of eating baked beans","story":"From that initial cold forkful to just the right amount of cheese, we’ve settled it – this is how you should be enjoying your beansForget whether the dress was blue or white, or if there was room for Jack on that floating debris – the most heated debates of our generation revolve around food. Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream rhyme it with “gone” certainly not and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as wellWhile it’s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.3 Acceptable toppingsThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We’ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.4 The cheese rulesDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans’ sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it’s simply not the correct way – the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.5 No napkins, embrace the sauceDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else’s.6 Set the beans freeOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it’s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there’s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let’s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.7 The right type of breadThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we’ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn’t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

He went to a friend whose theatre company, withWings, took inventive musical adaptations to the Edinburgh fringe. That year they were doing Le Bossu, a retelling of The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Patel mentioned that he wanted to get out of his comfort zone and do some theatre. “He came back to me and said, ‘Cool, well, I can offer you the role of a pigeon.’”Most actors who had spent their lives being watched by 8m viewers, four nights a week, would be unwilling to start again at the bottom rung of acting. (The pigeon was a bit part.) But Patel, now 29, leapt at the chance.“And, honestly, playing that pigeon, for so many reasons, was one of the most important things I ever did. I remember that feeling being side of stage as the lights went down – that fear was so visceral. Then, as the run went on, it slowly ebbed away. It let me become a more extroverted performer, which set me up for what came next.”What came next was a starring role in Danny Boyle’s counter-factual caper Yesterday, in which Patel stars as Jack Malik who, after a freak thunderstorm, is the only person on earth who remembers the music of the Beatles. Malik becomes a star overnight, plays Wembley with Ed Sheeran, and is hailed as the greatest songwriter of his generation. The film transformed Patel’s life with similar force. His follow-up roles have all screamed prestige: leading turns in Armando Iannucci’s sci-fi spoof Avenue 5 and the BBC’s adaptation of Eleanor Catton’s The Luminaries, the 2013 novel, set in the New Zealand goldrush.“The episode we filmed was the beginning of the outbreak. It felt incredibly odd, making a show about a global pandemic, and now here we are.” The oddest moment, he says, was finding out that production of a series about a pandemic was now on hold because of a pandemic. We meet on a weekday lunchtime at a pub in Islington, London in that eerie period before the enforced lockdown when pubs and restaurants are still open but people are furiously washing their hands and firing evil glares at anyone clearing their throat. The pub has posters declaring that the toilet doors have been jammed open so you don’t have to touch any handles. It means the faint sound of ablutions can be heard throughout our conversation.Patel arrives straight from the photoshoot, an experience he tentatively enjoyed. His parents own a newsagents in the small village of Sawtry, near Cambridge, and he likes knowing that they’ll get the papers in one morning and see photos of him looking suave. He hasn’t always been a fan of Sunday supplements. As a teenager, he had to help out his folks by doing the local paper round. Weekends, he says, were always the worst. “The papers were full of magazines! So I’d have to walk up the hill, then go back down, and then go further up the hill because you can’t carry them all at once.”As well as school and the paper round, he went to several different drama schools. He giggles when I ask what it was that set apart the kinds of kids he met at those after-school classes. “We were all a bit odd, mimicking things we’d seen on telly, creating these little pop-culture storms within our own lives. Maybe some of us were quite attention-hungry, but we were alive with this energy. It’s the antithesis of a maths lesson. It’s about play.”He was 16 when a new executive producer on EastEnders, Diederick Santer, began an overhaul of the families on the soap to make it “feel more 21st century”. That included introducing a Pakistani family on the show, the Masoods. Patel was nervous in the audition for Tamwar Masood and thought he’d ruined his chances when he told producers he didn’t really watch the show. But they saw something in him and, once on board, he went about turning Tamwar into one of the most unusual characters in soap. He was removed and analytical. He existed almost outside the show, a kind of geeky flaneur who saw the absurdity of Albert Square in the same way the audience did. In a show that’s always been about dramatic bust-ups and big acting, Patel played against the action: quiet and pitying, often lingering in the back of someone else’s family crisis. Patel quickly became a fan favourite. His character’s marriage to Afia Khan (Meryl Fernandes) won the pair Inside Soap award for best wedding.His parents, though proud, were also insistent that the paper round must continue. “Those were the days,” he says. “I’d be, like, ‘It’s the weekend, I’m trudging round the village in the rain, why am I having to do this?’ But I look back on it fondly. It was important for me to be on national TV and be doing a paper round at the same time. It was just a daily reminder of being brought back down to earth.”By his mid-20s, Patel was beginning to look at the career paths available to him. “There’s a thin line between being on a soap and being a celebrity. You often see people from EastEnders going to do I’m a Celebrity or Strictly – which is great if that’s what you want to do. But from going to a lot of these awards ceremonies, it wasn’t somewhere I was ever going to enjoy myself.”He said the decision to leave was both easy and scary. “I’d been doing it since I was 16 and it was all I’d known as an adult. It was a leap of faith. I remember on that last day I drove out the gates that last time, and I just thought: here we go, let’s see what happens.”His certainty about wanting to do something more than Strictly is the result of his particular upbringing, he says. The closest town growing up was Huntingdon, in the heart of John Major’s old constituency. (Patel’s mother would always point out his house when they drove past.) He didn’t have any traumatic experiences of racism growing up, “but there were very few people who looked like me and there is a part of you that you consciously or subconsciously dilute in order to fit in. There are a lot of feelings that I grew up with that I later started to realise I wasn’t alone in feeling, and that perhaps there’s something to be done about that.”His adolescence left him with a dogged feeling of responsibility – to make it easier for the next generation of kids like him. He talks about “responsibility” a lot. “I suppose it’s the responsibility, as someone British, to say: ‘This is also British, the story that I’m telling you about my parents, or Indian soldiers that fought in the world wars.’ These stories are also British. At a time when people want to limit the idea of Britishness, physically speaking, I think I’d quite like to broaden it.”He gives the example of Britain’s colonial history in India, something he feels mainstream Britain has never properly wrestled with. “We watched a lot of Indian movies growing up, and every now and then there’d be one about British rule, but I never really learned about that in school. So there was a disconnect between these films I was watching, set during a very turbulent time in India’s history, and school, where we might be taught that Gandhi was a liberator, but not what he was liberating from.”He’s not angry at people who haven’t taken the time to learn that history, he says, but he sees his role as bringing those stories to them. He talks about watching Saving Private Ryan in history class, how it brought to life a war he would have otherwise struggled to imagine. “One of the most powerful ways of finding out about stuff is TV and film. If I can, in my current position, get the ball rolling on some of those stories then I’d really like to do that.” (He says he has writing and acting projects in the works that would fulfil that brief.)It’s a sense of duty that imbues much of Patel’s life. Even when we’re talking about The Luminaries, in which he plays Emery Staines, a young prospector, conversation veers back to the importance of minority stories in national history. During the six months he spent in New Zealand filming the show, which will air later this year, he was impressed by the public’s understanding of a wide range of historical events. “I fell in love with the culture. For a country that was a colonial outpost, as it were, they’ve really made efforts to integrate the indigenous Māori culture. The country is not without its troubles, but we went up to Waitangi, where the British signed a treaty with the Māori, and even just tiny gestures, like the signs being both in English and in Māori. A lot of people who I met who were not of Māori descent were just as aware of that history, which was commendable.”One concrete change he is trying to make is through his membership of Bafta, which was heavily criticised for all-white shortlists in a number of award categories. Patel was one of several actors who offered alternative shortlists in protest: “The oddity for me is how an amazing film such as Parasite did so well and yet none of the actors got nominated.”I ask whether he ever feels annoyed having to hand over his annual Bafta membership fee (not cheap at £495), when the awards fail to recognise erse talent again and again. Does there ever come a point where the institutions themselves should be left to fail?“I know some people feel like that, but I don’t think I’m there yet because the impact of things like the Baftas is still huge. I grew up in a rural place, naive to how a lot of the industry works. For me watching the Baftas was a big deal. When Slumdog Millionaire won all those awards I thought, wow it’s relevant on that level. So now I’m a member I want to change things from the inside.”Patel has a persistent seriousness about him. His manner is more that of an activist: dogged and thoughtful. The paper round, the pigeon, the desire to make movies that get shown in a classroom… it all reflects a person entirely uninterested in flashness. We all want to be seen as compassionate, but surely he has moments of indulging his new wealth and celebrity? What’s been his most lavish purchase?“Mmm, well recently I kept seeing Teslas everywhere, so I did have a brief look at their website kind of going, ‘Well, it’s good for the planet isn’t it?’ But it is still very expensive. And I live in London, so I don’t need a car.” Instead, he says, he bought a new camera. “My dad always had cameras around. I like the very quiet way of saying things through photography. There’s something about the ambiguity, and the silence of a photo...” I am convinced, with the sombreness of this remark, this is the real Himesh.The Luminaries will screen on BBC Two later this yearGrooming by Petra Sellge at The Wall Group using Living Proof photographer’s assistant Harry Brayne fashion assistant Peter Bevan shot at Big Sky Studios This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

The virus acts like no other pathogen. Two metres is entirely subjective now, expanding and contracting to meet our needs. Time is non-Newtonian, like the cornflour you’ve probably resorted to if you have small children to entertain, stiff and fluid at once. Numbers are basically meaningless: in pandemic maths, a figure such as 413 deaths – the one released on the day I am writing, an unthinkable catastrophe at another time – is encouraging, a cause for some optimism.The old certainties are eroded, but tucked away in our isolation pods, new physical laws are emerging for this way of living. The science is in its early stages, but empirically, some important developments have been observed. As a person with absolutely no grasp of science of any kind, I am your perfect guide to these.1. Wherever you want to be in your lockdown space, someone else urgently needs to be there. Yes, right now. In my space, that person is also always wielding a hammer. I believe it was Chekhov who said do not introduce a hammer in act 1 if you are not going to hammer like a maniac through acts 2-4 and this dramatic principle is respected here.2. Windows. However you like them is the opposite of how your fellow inmates like them. Now your life is just a window-based war of attrition. This is how the new proverb “When a window opens, a window closes” has emerged.3. Since we are all now ruminants, constantly grazing, we have developed an extra stomach to accommodate our preferred self-soothing lockdown snack when full of other foods. I have a cheese and onion crisp stomach now. Don’t argue with science.4. Speaking of food, that treat item you have been looking forward to, saving, obsessing over? Someone has already eaten it. They didn’t even enjoy it! They were just filling time. They might even have left a bit, in the bin for you to find.5. On the topic of bins, Bin Perception Syndrome, whilst not new to science, has been reportedly exacerbated during the corona crisis. The syndrome manifests in two ways: either sufferers can no longer see the bin at all, even when surrounded by flies and being excavated by an opportunistic dog, or they can see nothing but the bin, which they perceive as vast, pulsing, taking up their entire consciousness.6. Fractions: for any attempt to watch something “as a family” or other collective isolation unit, the following proportions apply: ¼ asleep ¼ claimed they wanted to watch but are now fiddling with their phones ¼ never pretended they would do anything but fiddle with their phones and ¼ loudly criticising, hating every moment, but in fact the only person with eyes actually on screen.7. If you work solidly for eight hours, taking only two 10-minute breaks and ostentatiously mention how busy you are and how imperative it is that you must not be disturbed, the only time someone will disturb you is during those 10-minute breaks, when you will be either watching a video of a horse with a luxuriant moustache or attempting a headstand. You will not be succeeding at the headstand when interrupted: you will be flailing like a capsized turtle.8. The apex predator in every new urban multi-prey system is the seagull. This is another excellent reason not to go outside: with no discarded KFC Zingers to feast on, they are hungrier and angrier than ever.9. Biologists have also observed that a new, lean super-species of domestic dog is emerging thanks to frequent lengthy walks taken by pod members to get away from other pod members, using the dog as an excuse. The pod is creating a post-lockdown rod for its own back with the super-dog, which will require a minimum of four hours daily exercise.11. All conversations follow a fixed formula that my friend has named the “coronamöbius strip”, looping and repeating infinitely. Nothing has happened to any of us (if we’re lucky), but we need to express it, yet again.12. There is a fixed amount of morale in a lockdown space. It does not increase or decrease, simply passes between iniduals within the space. The nice thing about this is that you can reframe your filthy moods as an act of altruism towards other pod members.

Obsessively rearranging your groceries by best-before date. Binge-watching old episodes of Terry and June. Blankly staring at the forks in your cutlery drawer wondering why they have four prongs and not three.Instead, the past few weeks have shown that being shut away could be making us more connected with each other. Thanks to strong internet networks and an array of digital apps and video communication software, we’re spending more quality time with loved ones, rehabilitating old relationships and forging new ones. Indeed, a recent study by Channel Mum found a quarter of British people now talk with neighbours they previously ignored. In short? Being confined to quarters is helping us rediscover a new sense of community.Every day brings more inspiring and creative digital gatherings, whether it’s quarantine quizzes, online aperitivo or friends slogging up their staircases thousands of times in a bid to conquer a virtual Everest. While we’re all busy rearranging our lives to adjust to the new norm, internet providers are doing their bit too. Taking capacity from commuter hotspots such as Waterloo to expand capacity in the suburbs is one way networks such as Vodafone are adjusting their behaviour. With internet connectivity remaining robust, here’s some inventive ways to escape the lockdown funk and embrace webcameraderie.The shutters might be closed on the nation’s pubs, but that hasn’t stopped people excitedly cheersing each other in brilliantly-named virtual pubs such as The Stay Inn and The Quarant Inn. Sequestered merrymakers have also been improvising cocktails from dusty bottles of crème de menthe and kumquat-flavoured vodka found lurking in their drinks cupboards (see the #quarantini hashtag on Instagram). For many, these sofa-based happy hours are preferable to the real thing: after all, there’s no five-deep bar queues, plus you can do a covert French exit by pretending to have accidentally snagged your socks on some cables.Online rendezvous: The Red (On)Lion: a cyber pub from real ale aficionados Camra. Mimicking the ambience of a traditional pub, remote revellers participate in games and quizzes, plus attend talks on subjects ranging from homebrewing to Belgian beer.Even Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall is a fan of Houseparty, the chat app where groups have been throwing virtual dinner parties, staging karaoke singalongs and playing board games. Quarantine quizzes have flourished, too (check out Edinburgh-based Goose’s Quizzes on Twitch), along with online book clubs: Yiyun Li’s #TolstoyTogether sees the author lead fellow bibliophiles in a daily War and Peace reading. Feeling cheeky? Try gatecrashing one of the growing number of nuptials and other parties held online. Hundreds of people tuned in to watch 13-year-old London schoolboy Jude Cannon’s bar mitzvah in his parents’ living room after his original one was cancelled, while in China one wedding was livestreamed to 3 million people. Just don’t expect any free drinks.Online rendezvous: Salon London livestreamed a book club where online audiences engage in Q\u0026ampAs with authors such as Emma Jane Unsworth.Personal trainer Joe Wicks has done a sterling job marshalling the nation’s cooped-up urchins into doing kangaroo hops at 9am. To help the 1.2 million subscribers doing PE with Wicks each morning, internet providers such as Vodafone are flexing to provide the powerful network we rely on to keep our kids active. Domestic dancing has also taken off: see Fame legend Debbie Allen’s Instagram Live lessons (one recent light-the-sky-up-like-a-flame workout attracted 34,000 people), or the English National Ballet’s Tamara Rojo’s Facebook classes.Online rendezvous: Fitness app Urban offers private, livestreamed classes (in yoga, physiotherapy, mindfulness and personal training), pairing you with a self-employed professional whose livelihood may have been affected by the pandemic.In recent weeks, Netflix Party, the Chrome extension that allows groups of friends to watch and comment on series and movies together, at the same time, has turned television into a communal activity again: something that only happens at Christmas or during the World Cup. Its live chat room might be the digi-equivalent of the crisp-packet-rustler down your local multiplex, but there’s no better way to laugh, comment and discuss the intricacies of Joe Exotic’s mullet en masse.Online rendezvous: With many Hollywood films getting early digital releases, a number of stars are hosting interactive events. When sci-fi thriller The Invisible Man hit streaming platforms, director Leigh Whannell held a Twitter live group-watch answering viewers’ questions in a virtual Q\u0026ampA afterwards.Ever wanted to learn how to spoon carve? Master the oboe? Speak the Cyrillic alphabet from A to Я? There’s never been a better time to pick up new skills as specialists everywhere dispense their wisdom via one-on-one video tuition. A quick online search should throw up a willing tutor for whatever whimsy you have, whether it’s cake decorating, choir practice or Colombian cookery. Meanwhile, InterPals, My Language Exchange and Italki pairs anybody eager to learn a language with a native speaker on Skype or FaceTime.Online rendezvous: Over on Zoom, Cocktails After Dark features out-of-work bartenders teaching viewers how to make drinks (plus earning much-needed tips in the process). And MasterClass features video classes from the likes of Martin Scorsese, Serena Williams, Werner Herzog, Annie Leibovitz, Aaron Sorkin, Herbie Hancock and Neil Gaiman.Travel might be on pause at the moment, but people are still globetrotting vicariously. An expedition team of 30 climbing friends in the UK recently clambered up a virtual Mount Everest – all 8,848m of it – by trudging up stairs, steps and ladders within their own homes (often kitted up in full mountaineering gear). Elsewhere, tourist attractions such as the Louvre, British Museum and New York’s Guggenheim now offer 360-degree videos and livestreaming on their websites. Wildlife fans can ogle webcams showing brown bears emerging from hibernation in Alaska’s Katmai National Park, majestic pachyderms and other charismatic megafauna at South Africa’s Tembe Elephant Park, or sea otters sploshing around at Monterey Bay Aquarium.Online rendezvous: The Scandi trend for slow TV is seemingly tailor-made for these trapped-inside times. Fire up the three-hour-long Sailing to Tobago YouTube video on your laptop, fix quarantini-inspired rum cocktails and stream a destination-appropriate calypsoyacht rock playlist and you’ll be gliding (imaginary) crystalline Caribbean waters in no time.“I’ll find a way to deal with the ennui,” declared Christine and the Queens recently. Her method was throwing herself into near-daily live performances from a Paris studio on Instagram. Other musicians have been livestreaming shows, too, such as Neil Young, Erykah Badu, Alicia Keys, Charli XCX and more. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization’s #TogetherAtHome concert series has featured John Legend and Chris Martin. A virtual Live Aid-style charity concert is surely in the offing.Online rendezvous: New York’s politan Opera House has been livestreaming an opera every night on its website.Vodafone #KeepingtheUKConnectedWhile we’re stuck indoors, it’s never been more important to keep connected with your friends and family.

Ingredient swaps – sugar, flour, yeast – took place on doorsteps. The camaraderie confirmed what Maria, who has lived on this street for 15 years, has always known. Her “charmed” corner of Stoke Newington, with its Turkish grocers and independent shops, is “a great place to live”.Staying inside the terraced house she shares with her three children and husband Matthew Morgan, a writer, was no hardship either. The Argentinian-born designer, who has a background in theatre, has a knack for expressive but practical interiors. Her Victorian home is a case in point. By knocking down walls and layering colour with pattern, texture and art, she’s turned the five-bedroom house into a place to work, relax and socialise.Downstairs in the open-plan reception rooms, deep shelving houses a well-stocked bar and there’s enough space for the children to make dens. French doors open on to a garden large enough for games. With the advent of lockdown, the home office became a home school strewn with textbooks and art paraphernalia. “We haven’t got round to making soda bread or pasta like everyone else on social media. But I’ve realised that we have almost everything we need under one roof.”Her previous home was a maisonette a few doors down. “When I moved in I was newly single and feeling sorry for myself. All my neighbours prophesied that I would get pregnant. ‘Everyone gets pregnant in that flat,’ they told me.” It was a local myth which proved to be true. Within months she met Matthew.“When I was expecting our first child we decided to move to a bigger home. We’d set our sights on this house, but it was too expensive.” Then came the crash of 2008. “We were walking past when the owner appeared. We asked if he was still selling. He said yes and invited us in. We fixed a price there and then.”The previous owner had altered the house, adding the extension at the back and converting the attic. “But most of the work had been badly done so we had lots to do,” she says. “Many design crimes had been committed.”Among these was the laminate flooring downstairs. It was ripped up to reveal original floorboards that were then stripped and limewashed. Upstairs, partition walls were removed to open up the poky bathroom, where cascading house plants and bright encaustic tiles remind Maria of her childhood in rural Argentina. Some original features, such as the stained glass and the marble fireplace were intact, but most of the plasterwork had been ripped out. Luckily, she was able to rescue sections of original mouldings from a neighbour who was refurbishing their own property. She used these to recast the 19th-century cornices and ceiling roses.Before landing her first job in interiors with London designer Kate Guinness, Maria worked as a theatrical costume designer at venues such as the Barbican. She also attended London’s influential Motley Theatre Design Course, whose alumni include Olivier-award-winning Es Devlin.“I draw on my theatrical training for homes. A costume has to express its wearer, and it’s the same for interiors. There’s no right or wrong taste it’s about finding the colours and objects which make you feel happy. It’s a form of therapy.”Working in theatre has also made her resourceful. She did most of the decorating herself, experimenting with colours – “like a teenager trying out new hair dyes” – that suit her optimistic disposition. “My clients’ homes have to be perfect, but I’m not afraid of trying out new colours here.”Although every room is different – fern green in the living room, a whisper of pink in the bedroom – the effect is the same. “I chose cheerful but calm colours. Muted or neutral tones don’t reassure me. Strong contrasts are where I feel comfortable.”The floors are strewn with colourful woollen frazada rugs from Argentina. Art by family and locals, like Rob Ryan, sit next to beachcombed shells and stones under glass domes. “Anything is a treasure in this house.”Most of the antiques – the Murano chandeliers, the 1960s resin side table – were found locally. For curtains and cushions, she used bold botanical prints by 20th-century Swedish designer Svenskt Tenn, who she’s admired since childhood when her mother gave her a fabric sample.Before lockdown, a neighbour popped over to use the kitchen as a colourful backdrop for a teaching video. The floral wallpaper (also by Svenskt Tenn) is a recent addition – “It makes us smile” – and matches the extendable antique French table that she painted blue. Maria loved the solid wood kitchen units (by deVOL) so much that she travelled to Leicester to buy them after spotting the designs in a magazine 10 years ago. They are freestanding and one day they will travel with the family to their next home.She’s not sure where that will be, but you suspect it won’t be far away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3d944dc9f663b3dc25dd518c91996b47c154b6d/0_173_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15c7c23ecb86029fb0727c678faf6fa2","title":"i have craved a slower pace of life and want to make it permanent mariella frostrup","story":"When lockdown has ended, we must continue to live simpler lives to benefit both us and the planet, says Mariella FrostrupThe dilemma I know we’re in the middle of a global pandemic with the economy knackered and the free world led by a man like Trump. I know our freedom has been temporarily taken away from us. But I’m dreading the end of lockdown.For years I’ve craved a slower pace of life. Lockdown has allowed me to spend time with my family – and not on the relentless promise of success in my career. It has allowed me to play and learn with my child, rather than rush to drop-off or pick-up at wraparound care. It has allowed me to walk in woodland rather than standing on a crowded commuter train. In many ways it has been idyllic.Yes, I know I’m lucky to be able to work from home instead of being furloughed. Yes, I miss friends and family and meals out, and theatre and cinema and sport. But I’m loving this pace of life and struggle to come to terms with going back to “normal”. Should I use this break as a chance to re-evaluate my way of life?Mariella replies The short answer? Yes! I’m sure that plenty of us will look back at this momentary pause in normal proceedings and share your sense of regret for its passing.Yes there is extreme hardship and a financial impact that few will escape but, for all that, these are definitely gentler days for many of us. Not just in terms of kindnesses and a reduction in the everyday frenzy of life, but beyond that, there is a slow dawning of appreciation of the things we’ve failed to value highly enough. The proximity of those we love the luxury of idling the value to our lives of friends not in our immediate reach the enriched quality of a kind of existence that is possible when we are not running our lives against a ticking clock. There is also the pleasure of supporting local enterprises that have proved so much more essential than the impersonal giants that, for all their market domination, just weren’t there when we needed them.For old socialists like me, the best of that ideology seems to be experiencing a reawakening as more and more people realise that the way of life we’ve been aspiring to pre-Covid hasn’t produced a bounty of wellbeing. It says a lot about our old lifestyle that the “wellness industry” was booming, making big bucks by commercialising the very things many of us are now enjoying under lockdown. Maybe that goal of “wellness”, but without the trademark, should now be top of our list of good things to retain from this traumatic time. Would it not be a fitting fate for this insidious virus that’s stolen so much from us, to rebrand it as a positive new “ism”, symbolising the moment our world paused and we reconstructed our dreams of what a good life should be? When we are forced to battle our way back into business, would it not be possible to make sure the same old rat race does not re-emerge? To try to maintain the central compassionate glow of this Covid spring?Making the most of the time left is starting to feel like an imperative and you are not alone in experiencing the tightening of a knot in your stomach at the prospect of the lockdown bubble bursting. The cooped-up chaos, endless rowing and inertia that most of us expected seems instead to have configured itself into a better sense of being. Kids, no matter how reluctantly, taking some responsibility for chores adults with time to talk to each other, to walk and read and listen and even play cards of an evening! Our world definitely seems to improve when we relinquish the expectations we have come to embrace as normal ambitions, sustained by endless and relentless consumerism.Now may well be the moment to take note of the beneficial impact that simpler lifestyles have had on us and our planet and insist that, when the time comes for re-entry, we won’t just step back on the treadmill. I know that with an economy in freefall and job losses at an all-time high it won’t be hard to tempt us into re-embracing our bad consumerist habits, but does a less frenetic pace have to be a bad economic choice? What I am certain of is that it would be an even greater tragedy than the one that has just befallen us to learn nothing from the whole experience except how to be better prepared for a pandemic.Would we be “living the dream” if, after losing so many of those we love, enduring terrible financial hardship and cataclysmic job losses, we turned around and went straight back to normal once the threat of the virus abated? If I believed in God, I’d consider Covid-19 a pretty strong message from him about the need for behavioural change. I’d like to join with you in exhorting readers to celebrate how different and better a world not based on “busyness” actually is – and could be. I’d be tempted to call this new awakening Covidism, as a mark of respect to those who have died and a way of reminding ourselves that their deaths should not be in vain. It’s given us pause for thought and if we’ve learned nothing from it, we really are a lost cause.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure discussion remains on topics raised by the writer.

For one thing, the public aren’t thinking of the statistics as dry and abstract: they understand how critical they are. People are learning about methodologies and bell curves and logarithmic scales because they’re no longer inclined to look away from the screen when they see those words. That means there are also huge opportunities to learn and for people to change their (usually negative!) relationship with numbers.I think we’ve always had the responsibility to inform without making people feel afraid, alone or sad. At first though, especially here in the US, it felt like not enough people were sufficiently scared. It was fear that was compelling me to stay at home – fear of making other people sick and fear of getting sick myself. So I was trying to create data visualisations that had that emotional resonance too. Illustrations that showed the numbers in a way that communicated the seriousness of this situation. I think that now the need has shifted a little where most people grasp the gravity of the situation. They need information about how to cope.Data is key in this crisis. It tells us the story of how the virus is spreading, who it affects most and, with political will, it could help pave the way out.I am fascinated by what is left out of datasets. What we collect and omit tells us something about what we value and overlook as a society. If you don’t have data you can’t understand a problem or begin to formulate effective public policy to address it. As a journalist the gaps in datasets also give you a sense of what is not understood and should be examined in greater depth. This line of thinking has informed much of our reporting to date.We have uncovered flaws in the government death toll, shown how the most deprived would be disproportionately affected if parks were closed, revealed BAME people are more at risk of dying from Covid-19, and explored why the poor are twice as likely to die of the virus as the rich.Work is incredibly demanding at the moment. Very often we’re trying to make sense of new information and patchy datasets in a rapidly evolving crisis. So far data has shown us that the virus is certainly not a social leveller, rather it has found the cracks in society and blown them wide open, making long-standing inequalities painfully clear. By inquiring beyond the headline numbers, data can help us understand who the virus is affecting the most so we can forge a fairer society once this has passed.Counting the human cost of the coronavirus has been one of the greatest challenges faced professionally by journalists since the onset of the pandemic: even the number of deaths is genuinely hard to provide. Part of the problem is that data collection and reporting by the responsible agencies in the UK and elsewhere has been slow to become uniform: ordinarily deaths are collected by statistical bodies with a delay. But deaths due to Covid-19 are of obvious public interest and so the figures need to be circulated. Therefore, for data journalists like myself, much of the past two months has been spent chasing data figuring out which deaths have and have not been included in various organisations’ figures finding out what we can and cannot compare. As a  journalist you are always focused on reporting the truth. Never has this been more pronounced than in this crisis, where you are hyper-aware that underreporting the figures could cause complacency whereas exaggerating them could cause panic. Some have criticised journalists for not being critical enough while others wrongly, and dangerously, suggest that the figures are exaggerated. But it isn’t those people we concern ourselves with: it is getting to the truth and pointing out what we know when we know it. This means that we aren’t just putting out a BIG FIGURE and leaving it at that. Instead we are explaining why we think the BIG FIGURE isn’t the whole picture. We have faith in our audience’s ability to recognise that we may not have all the answers right now but that we are working tirelessly to get them.Australia is now a success story in terms of its early response to Covid-19, with new cases now often below 20 a day, and far fewer deaths per million people than other countries. How this early success in flattening the curve transitions into an easing of restrictions and the prospect of a second wave remains to be seen.When the pandemic started worsening in Australia, there were significant challenges with reporting on basic aspects of the outbreak.Because of the difference in reporting times and methods, getting basic information correct such as the number of cases, deaths, and testing rates required staying on top of information released by nine governments.Inspired by other projects doing similar work we started tracking these figures internally, and then decided to release the data with a licence allowing reuse. This decision paid off – the data has been used by researchers, private companies and ordinary citizens to analyse and visualise the pandemic’s impact on Australia.Having the data openly accessible also means our figures are constantly being checked, ensuring they are as accurate as possible. This was especially helpful in the early days when significant time pressure would inevitably mean some mistakes – thankfully quickly corrected in response to reader emails.The response has been phenomenal. The summary page has been one of the most popular pieces we have produced during the pandemic, with 5.4m page views at the time of writing. The data also is used in all our liveblogs to give readers a quick summary of the current situation.We realised very early on that the story of the coronavirus crisis would benefit hugely from visually led coverage – we published our first visual explainer on the topic in early February, when the overwhelming majority of confirmed cases and deaths were still being reported in China.From this early stage, our audience was eager to understand the details of the story. We wanted to report on it in a way that was easy to understand and offered clear conclusions. Using maps and charts, we were able to analyse the quantity and speed with which the disease multiplied each day. Our visual trackers evolved as we were able to establish comparisons between countries, put the data into historical context and shed light on different scenarios playing out in different regions.Visual journalists around the world are coming up with ever more ingenious ways of explaining and contextualising the numbers, from case counts to reproduction numbers, to the tragic death toll of the virus.“Flatten the curve” is perhaps the best example of a visualisation so well designed and so memorable that it has become a universally understood metaphor for a concept that would require a much lengthier explanation if one tried to convey it through words alone.Our team is following the lively debate within the data visualisation community closely, and we’re constantly working to improve our own coronavirus trackers while experimenting with new formats to communicate the scale of the emergency. We have also experienced a growing interest from our readers in how we make our graphics, with a variety of questions reaching us each day via email and social networks.As the global pandemic continues, we’re using visuals to drive home the dramatic change that the virus has spurred in the way we live and work – from mapping how lockdown measures have slashed global air pollution to quantifying the disastrous impact on the economy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e2cc71f86fa6cb140161751710e6fc57e4467b2/0_252_4600_2759/master/4600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e15531ae6fcfedd2a1fe3a7fa482209f","title":"how to save in lockdown from buying chairs and laptops to car insurance","story":"We may be spending less by not travelling to work, but with an uncertain future it’s time to take stock of personal financesWith gyms shut, taps turned off in pubs and the prospect of a holiday a distant dream, many people are finding their outgoings have dropped since lockdown. But the shadow of a looming recession and concern about whether jobs will even exist when offices reopen, means many are looking at their finances even more closely.So what are the best ways to improve them amid extraordinary times and an uncertain future?Wholesale energy prices are decreasing, however, and this is being passed on to the consumer by some of the smaller providers. So it is worth shopping around.“There’s a huge gap of £404 between the cheapest deal on the market and the price cap on the standard variable tariff,” says uSwitch. “The gap hasn’t been this wide since last summer.” It is always worth seeing if you can reduce your bill. But be sure to look at the unit price to ensure you are comparing like with like.Companies are allowed to pay staff £6 a week tax free if they are obliged to work from home, so find out if that is an option.If setting up a home office has meant buying new equipment, you can claim income tax relief for employment expenses, including broadband and heat. Fill out a P87 form if the expenses are less than £2,500 for the year. For more than that, you will need to complete a self-assessment tax return. The relief is available if the expenses are “wholly, exclusively and necessarily” needed in performance of a job, so cannot be bought for personal use and claimed for later.Loss of income has led to over 1.6 million households applying to have mortgage payments and interest charges deferred for up to three months, but it is not a step to take lightly.While there have been assurances that taking a “payment holiday” will not affect an inidual’s credit rating, there have been warnings that some may be turned away from future borrowing as they are effectively declaring they are in financial difficulty.You must agree the “mortgage holiday” with your lender - otherwise payments which are stopped may be recorded as being late. Talk to your lender about extending the term, which will increase the overall sum paid but make it more manageable each month. And if you are not on a special deal, you can remortgage.If you are on a tracker mortgage or another type of variable rate deal, you should be seeing costs come down by about £40 a month for every £100,000 borrowed. With quieter roads, insurers are reaping the benefits of fewer claims. Some are passing some of this on: Admiral was the first to offer partial refunds to drivers stuck at home, promising £25 for each car and van it covered as of 20 April. LV has also said it will return money, but this will not happen automatically, or for everyone. Contact the company if you think you qualify.Drivers who are doing substantially fewer miles may be able to get a partial refund by contacting their insurer. This could also be an option if a named driver is not using the car.There is some early evidence that the impact of coronavirus may decrease premiums. “An unintended consequence has been fewer cars on the roads and fewer accidents, so it’s fair to assume that this could result in reduced prices,” says Dave Merrick from MoneySuperMarket. Drivers are advised to make sure their policy does not “auto renew” and they can get the benefit of shopping around.This year is the end of a lost decade for savers, and recent events will leave them with little confidence that there will be any improvement in the near future. At the height of this emergency, the Bank of England cut interest rates twice in the space of a week, bringing them to the lowest level in its history.This may not be the end of the cuts so people would be wise to look at the best rates available now and switch. “In the months to come consumers may well rely on simple savings accounts to store any disposable income from lockdown, cash taken out of the stock market, or even pension freedoms cash,” says Rachel Springall of Moneyfacts. “If this cash floods the savings market, providers could cut rates to deter investors - if they are awash with cash - or even pull accounts entirely to cope with demand. This means savers have to be quick off the mark to secure the best possible rates and keep a close eye on the changing market.”Some people may consider a fixed one-year bond to guarantee them a return over the coming year but due to the uncertainties surrounding the economy once the coronavirus problem subsides, some will be reluctant to lock their money away.

Some of the lyricism is a little clumsy (“We fuck and make-up like it’s Maybelline”), and the Megan Thee Stallion feature is an all-too-brief skit, but overall Kehlani sounds assured and impressive here, offering sensuality and intimacy in her candour."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ff969f20f624a89c5585d3811598674ac134743/0_12_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74704683d58599724162bdf64e619e5e","title":"reopening mississippi americas poorest state begins lifting lockdown podcast","story":"Despite rising coronavirus case numbers, the US state of Mississippi is moving out of lockdown and reopening parks, restaurants and other non-essential shops.

She didn’t expect to become the story.In her other life, the MP for Tooting is an A\u0026ampE doctor and intensive care specialist and has been working 12-hour hospital shifts throughout the pandemic. Allin-Khan reported that the government’s failures were contributing to a greater loss of life and she wanted answers on its testing strategy. The health secretary awkwardly responded by suggesting that Allin-Khan’s testimony was untrue and moreover, that she “might do well to take a leaf out of the shadow secretary of state’s book in terms of tone”.“Watch your tone!” Allin-Khan exhales, still in mild disbelief. “I have written to the government several times since March, asking why we haven’t followed WHO guidelines, asking for clearer messaging on social distancing, urging for more PPE. I’ve had no response. I was bringing messages from the frontline,” she says over the phone from her home in south London.The exchange went viral after she tweeted it, morphing into a meme online then as a talking point on Good Morning Britain, Sky News, BBC News, LBC and beyond. Being patronised by Hancock was one thing, but to be dismissed so audaciously on the day the UK reported the highest death toll in Europe galls her.“I was very courteous in my delivery. If Matt Hancock found it difficult, that’s on him. Addressing the fact that lives could have been saved and families’ hearts might not have been broken had we got on top of testing earlier? These are legitimate questions that people all across the country have. I was very polite. He didn’t like the content, so instead felt it easier to make a derogatory comment towards me.”Allin-Khan says she is used to confounding people. Her mother is Polish and her father is Pakistani and she grew up in a poor household in the constituency she now represents as “a proud British Muslim”. She describes her upbringing as “difficult … turbulent”.She won’t elaborate out of sensitivity towards her parents, except to say it meant “I failed my A-levels spectacularly”. Nonetheless, at 24, Allin-Khan ended up reading medicine at Cambridge and gained a masters in public health before working as a doctor in disaster zones across the world.“People are still confused by who I am or what I am,” she says, of the layers of ignorance she has navigated her whole life. “The biggest learning journey I have had as a politician is seeing how much I can be hated for being eastern European, for being Pakistani, for being Muslim. I never came from a political background. The vitriol shocked me.”At 42, alongside her constituency work, Allin-Khan serves as a shadow cabinet minister for mental health and is an amateur boxer, wife, and mother to two children under six. She stopped her campaign for Labour’s deputy leadership in March and then went to work treating Covid-19 patients at St George’s hospital in south London and at the newly opened Nightingale. The experience has been harrowing and frightening.“Families are begging me for a miracle I can’t give them. You’re unable to console them with a hug or a touch on the shoulder. You have to watch their hearts break, you’re the one delivering goodbye messages to their loved ones,” Allin-Khan takes a pause. “Messages like ‘please hold on, Dad’, ‘please hold on for the kids’ – it puts chills through your body but you have to hold it together and stay strong for these families. It is very hard to do.”At home, her children have been taught not to run to her until she has stripped her clothes into the washing machine and showered. She uses separate cutlery, crockery and towels from her family and has found herself in tears “wondering about how many of all those deaths could have been avoided”. She has found the clapping for key workers “a wonderful way for communities to feel they are supporting frontline staff. It’s an opportunity to say thank you”. But she is scornful that it is “a pointless exercise if government ministers clap, but don’t provide resources the NHS needs”. Allin-Khan became a Labour councillor during her first maternity leave in 2014, winning “in a local ward that had been Conservative for 24 years”. Two years later, just after the birth of her second child, Sadiq Khan left his Tooting seat to become mayor of London and Allin-Khan was encouraged to stand. Allin-Khan was elected the day MP Jo Cox was murdered in 2016. “It was horrific,” she says flatly, at the time unsure of what she had got herself into. Allin-Khan claims not to have any political heroes – “mine are more everyday heroes” – but says she became more interested in politics at university. “The Labour party did change my life and gave me opportunities that wouldn’t have happened under the status quo,” she says. “It wouldn’t have been possible for someone with a background like mine to have gone to medical school otherwise.”Witnessing the erosion of the health service firsthand has been a prime motivator for her political energy. “I am so grateful to be doing the work I always did, but now I have MP after my name and suddenly people are interested. I can use my platform to be a voice for the voiceless.”It is indisputable to Allin-Khan that coronavirus has escalated a system already in crisis. “Uncertainty breeds anxiety. Labour wants to support the government to get this right. Our priority is protecting public health, but we do need a consensus on what happens next.” Is there a sense that criticism has been tempered in the Commons chamber for the sake of fostering national unity?“Nobody likes political point-scoring, but it is a challenge not to be able to scrutinise decisions that affect the whole country. Things like Boris Johnson announcing a press conference on Sunday to decide the future of the country? That sort of announcement should be made in parliament where there can be due diligence and scrutiny.”The Public Health England review into why so many BAME people are dying disproportionately from Covid-19 fills her with similar frustration. “I have reservations about the review and how it will be conducted.” Referring to the controversial appointment to the review of Trevor Phillips, the former chair of the Equality and Human Rights Commission who has been suspended from the Labour party over allegations of Islamophobia, she says: “We need to have trust in this review. Our BAME communities deserve it.”Allin-Khan says she was underestimated at the beginning of her political career, but that it only fuelled her to keep going. “I’m an ordinary woman living an extraordinary life, and I am driven very much by what is right and what is wrong,” she says. “If I lose my seat tomorrow, I will have been grateful to have represented my community and saved as many lives as I could. That’s why when Matt Hancock said what he said, I just thought no. No, I won’t watch my tone – I’ve got something I need to say.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6685e0f376000c06b3abe50c13900514d8ea522a/0_345_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d1fe5a4a156fb6d813bb9115999197a","title":"covid 19 isolated and alone britain has become the sick man of europe","story":"The disasters of Trump, Brexit and coronavirus have been made all the worse by our weak and incompetent leadersBritain is in a lonely place right now. It resembles the scene of a bad traffic accident where shocked passers-by look away with pity and horror in their eyes. Alarmed by what they see, governments around the world practise their own form of social distancing. Once again, Britain is the sick man of Europe.Lethal mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic is not the sole reason for this un-splendid isolation. The disease’s sudden onslaught is the third national disaster in almost as many years. The first was the decision to walk away from Europe. The second was the advent of Donald Trump and his anarchic America First agenda.However the virus’s death toll is calculated, the perception is taking hold, abroad as at home, that the Johnson government’s performance is one of the world’s worst, second possibly only to the US. Sympathy for Britain’s plight has not forestalled scathing international criticism.Italians may surely be forgiven a sense of relief that their country is no longer Europe’s biggest blackspot. With this unwanted title came the unspoken inference that Italy was uniquely unprepared. Some in the UK certainly saw it that way. They thought they were immune. They were betting, as usual, on a bogus British exceptionalism.Britain “did not pay enough attention to what was happening here”, commented Beppe Severgnini in Corriere della Sera, referring to the two- to three-week period when Italy was ahead of the corona curve. The UK “lost the advantage that fate and Italy gave it... when it was obvious the virus was spreading”.The view of Britain as Europe’s “problem child” predates the pandemic but has been greatly reinforced by it. Foreign perceptions of the UK as a badly governed, disorderly, embittered and chronically ided country took deep root in the politically chaotic years that followed the 2016 Brexit referendum.It’s possible that outside observers who were surprised by the anger and passion aroused by Brexit simply did not understand Britain. But the stunning levels of incompetence, jingoism and arrogance displayed by the British side during the withdrawal talks dismayed many Europeans. It was genuinely unexpected.What is China, for example, to make of leaders who fail to clearly disassociate from Trump’s self-serving claims that Beijing deliberately spread what he calls the “Wuhan virus”? Huffing and puffing on the Tory right over Huawei hardly bolsters Britain’s claim to be a free-trade champion open for business.Yet Boris Johnson’s government, ever more desperate for investment, is easy prey. Beijing’s “wolf warrior” diplomats will see the lack of substance at the heart of a remarkably low-calibre cabinet, and spot a chance for knockdown bargains. The age of the unequal treaty is back – with Britain the loser this time.What is true of China is true in spades of Trump’s America. Talks about a free-trade deal, begun last week, promise to expose the harsh reality of an isolated Britain’s feeble leverage vis-à-vis a relentlessly self-interested superpower. Lowered food safety standards may be among many enforced compromises.Yet the Trump presidency’s negative impact on British interests and values far surpasses disputes about chlorinated chicken. Since 2017, Trump has blasted many holes in the foundations of UK security, defence and foreign policy. Britain long counted the US its foremost friend and vital ally. Now that bond is breaking.On the climate crisis, on Iran, on Nato, on Israel-Palestine, on the UN and boycotted agencies such as the Human Rights Council, on multilateralism in general, on the primacy of international law, on relations with Vladimir Putin’s Russia, and on limiting new nuclear weapons, Trump has mostly ignored Britain’s views.To this sorry list of spats, splits and schisms may be added Trump’s support for big cuts in foreign aid, crude Islamophobia, the militarisation of space, commercial exploitation of the Arctic and his worrying contempt for democracy, honesty and accountability, as revealed by the Mueller inquiry and his Senate impeachment.What Johnson and Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, dare not admit, for it would wholly explode their Brexit fantasies, is that Trump’s America has become an unreliable, problematic and in some respects, hostile entity, with a tendency to belittle Britain, not build it up. His re-election would extend and intensify the nightmare.Trump, the greatest of all coronavirus failures, is dangerous to know. And yet still they hug him close, risking infection, petitioning for a deal at almost any cost, mimicking his anti-Europe, populist posturing, rejecting pandemic cooperation with the EU and insisting, even now, that Brexit will be sewn up by December. A stitch-up is more likely. It will end in tears.One disaster has swiftly followed another. Rarely in modern times has Britain’s place in the world looked so precarious. Rarely has its global reputation for competence, pragmatism and good sense been so battered and disrespected. Rarely have its people and economy faced such challenges and such crippling levels of debt.Perhaps the last time the country stood alone like this, frightened, sickened, beleaguered, lacking funds and resources and separated from friends, was when it faced a deadly invasion of a different type, 80 years ago next month. As it remembers the victory in Europe that eventually followed in 1945, Britain needs another miracle, a fresh strategy – and much better leaders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/748d32d8b4ad511d58a090ecf6edcf6130ea98db/240_494_4537_2721/master/4537.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78e132c1acb93e4a60428b6dd1ee6605","title":"government loan points very different future rugby league coronavirus","story":"The £16m secured by the RFL appears modest but reflects the precarious nature of club finances when fans have to stay awayAt first glance, the numbers do not seem that terrifying. While other mainstream sports predict the financial cost of Covid-19 will run into the hundreds of millions, last week’s news that the Rugby Football League has secured a £16m loan from the government suggests it is in reasonable shape – in need of assistance rather than full-blown emergency intervention.But take even a modest journey through this sport, whose roots remain firmly embedded in northern, working-class towns and you learn this money was absolutely essential to protect it from going under. Indeed, that was outlined to clubs in a recent email from the RFL. “The sport faces a genuine threat to its future,” it read.Rugby league is not a house built on sand but economically it is heavily reliant on two things: its multimillion-pound broadcast arrangement with Sky Sports and ticketing and merchandise revenue from the local communities that it supports in return. Where it differs from other sports is that even the most prominent, high-profile clubs are facing financial uncertainty due to the spread of coronavirus. In Super League, the average salary is £75,000 and only a handful of marquee players attract an annual income anywhere near those that footballers in the Premier League receive each and every week.Without income from supporters and the realistic possibility of a reduced TV deal from Sky in 2022, even the most sustainable clubs are worried. Castleford are one such example. Around a fifth of the town’s 40,000 population regularly attend games and their director of rugby, Jon Wells, believes there are implications ahead that could last for years. “I fear there will be a significant levelling-down exercise in rugby league finances,” he says. “Is a £100,000 player now worth £80,000? Is someone on £80,000 now worth £72,000?“The whole sport takes a hit, not just the lower leagues. I can’t see a rugby league event with fans in this year and that’s going to have huge implications. As a sport, we rely on our communities just as much as they rely on us.”The numbers become even more sobering the further down the pyramid you go. Hunslet were once one of rugby league’s most successful clubs, winning two league championships and two Challenge Cups before the second world war. Nowadays they participate in the sport’s lowest professional tier, League 1: where the average player earns £10,000 on a part-time playing contract.“A loss of around £15,000 would be enough for a good portion of clubs outside Super League to encounter serious insolvency issues,” says Damian Irvine, a director at Hunslet. “Clubs at this level were already in danger from any serious revenue fluctuation prior to Covid-19. I’d wager there were around a dozen clubs that were seriously worrying about their future without this loan.”Was the RFL worried some established clubs would go under without government intervention? “In a word, yes,” says Tony Sutton, the governing body’s finance director. “There were Super League clubs in jeopardy and we went to the government with a whole-game approach. These numbers may not sound much to some sports, but just £10,000 could be life-changing for a club in our sport. It was a terrifying prospect, what the sport might look like without this loan.”Rugby league took a surprisingly prominent role in last year’s general election campaign when the term “Workington man” – a northern, middle-aged male who enjoys rugby league – was coined by the Conservatives and seen as a crucial demographic in helping break down Labour’s “red wall” in the north of England.Traditional Labour constituencies in rugby league hotbeds such as Leigh, Wakefield and – yes – Workington went blue for the first time in a generation. But irrespective of their political allegiances these communities have league at their heart and it certainly helps their cause as far as securing government funding is concerned that the House of Commons Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, is a staunch fan. “Rugby league is a community sport, and community matters right now,” he says. “In the long-term the game benefits professionals, amateurs and people with disabilities.”A group of MPs from league constituencies that regularly meet in parliament were also vital. Judith Cummins is MP for Bradford South and chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Rugby League Group. “For every pound spent on the game, it’s estimated it generates three or four times that in terms of social impact,” she says. “The social impact of rugby league on its communities is estimated to be around £185m.“The sport may not attract the biggest headlines but it is a force for good. Having Sir Lindsay as Speaker championing the game is absolutely vital. Losing any of our clubs would have a grave social and economical impact on northern towns.”No club is immune to the precarious economics engulfing the game. Warrington are owned and financed by the multimillionaire music promoter, Simon Moran, yet even they may have to apply for a portion of the £16m loan. “We, just like other clubs, are massively reliant on income streams from our supporters,” says Karl Fitzpatrick, Warrington’s chief executive.“We’re fortunate with the benefactors we have but even their businesses are being hit by this and it’s going to take a long time for the sport to recover. I envisage we may well apply for some funding ourselves.”The majority of professional players have agreed pay cuts until the end of June, by which time the sport hopes to have resumed playing behind closed doors. But that in itself provides challenges given how even the richest clubs cannot survive forever without supporter income. This, again, is where league’s economics are laid bare: playing without fans could cause irreversible damage, but it is a risk the sport may have to take due to its contract with Sky.“That’s where this government money must go,” Sutton says. “Any notion of salaries going straight back to the level they were before because we’ve got this money is wide of the mark. This is going to be a long-term thing for rugby league.”Many CEOs agree, with one comparing the current crisis to the one that hit the banks in 2008, saying it could take years for league to return to the financial position it was in just a few weeks ago. As one chief executive put it: “In a year’s time, will our working-class fans be able to afford season tickets or two home games a month?”The world finds itself in a fast-moving, unprecedented situation but there remains the belief that one day things will return to normal. For rugby league, normal may never return: the sport may instead have to change forever in order to have any sort of future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ca6c12479cef99e524a14206c76b9f6bfc70f961/0_44_2200_1320/master/2200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8099e4f13423939c0af2f08a2672cc9","title":"my favourite game argentina v iran 2014 world cup","story":"My dad and I went from despair and frustration to pandemonium after Lionel Messi struck in style at the deathThe Argentinian radio journalist Alejandro Fantino shouted “We are a disaster” in the 89th minute. He was right. The match that most had expected to be a rout was turning into a historic upset.Argentina were as bad as Iran were good. Gonzalo Higuaín, Sergio Agüero and Ángel Di María were not working as a front three while the Asian champions were performing especially well at the back. Carlos Queiroz, Iran’s manager, appeared to have perfected the defensive formula that had plagued Argentina during the qualifiers: a parked bus and Lionel Messi well under control.Through the 90-inch plasma TV, it was clear that the spectre of Argentinian expectations hung over Messi just as much as Diego Maradona’s presence did in the stands. Messi was quiet and I was too on that summer afternoon. He was lost in the Mineirão Stadium while I sat clutching a beer at a Persian rooftop party in Miami.My friend’s Iranian father had invited me to watch this Group F game over a barbecue at his new downtown penthouse. Still a teen, I brought my dad with me. He drove, I drank, and we were the only Argentinians in attendance. We rode the elevator in our Argentina jerseys, bursting with pride. But upstairs, interest in the match was casual. People ate burgers and chatted while we munched our nails and breathed through every second of the contest in front of us.Messi’s inability to carry us to success, allied to his demure manner, were a cocktail of weakness that made him in the eyes of many, if not most, a pecho frío. For some he was not even Argentinian. Every minute we didn’t score was an excruciating one as we watched the narrative of his and our greatness trickle away. The veil was lifting and for the generation who had seen Maradona conquer the world, and for another who had grown up on Diego’s legend, patience was wearing thin.As the game trudged on I buried the feelings of impending doom in a few more beers, and had VAR existed back then, or had the referee had “super-slow-mo cyborg vision”, as Barney Ronay put it in his match report for the , it could have been worse, for Iran were denied what was clearly a penalty for a foul on Ashkan Dejagah in the 55th minute. But history is written by the victors.The party had mostly turned away from the TV and I had already received a few consoling pats on the back from guests as the game entered injury time. But then Fantino, I and the rest of the country ate our words. From the same spot he had lingered looking toothless and ineffective, and following a pass from Ezequiel Lavezzi, Messi curled the ball over two Irani defenders – one nicknamed Gucci – and, finally, the goalkeeper. It was a wonderful finish and also meant Argentina had qualified for the knockout stages.“Thank you, Pulga! Thank you, Messi! Thank you, Argentina!” screamed Fantino at the top of his voice. Meanwhile my dad and I absolutely lost it. We hugged and jumped up from our bar stools, also screaming at the top of our voices. My beer and a few others flew, soaking burgers and clothing nearby. It was a pure release, for in that moment the pain of waiting for success expired. Past and present met and the feeling lasted all of two more weeks, until Mario Götze did what he did in the final.When the ecstasy passed on that afternoon, my dad apologised to the host for soaking everyone’s food and clothing. He understood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb1b39d03eba2fc75c87e1f09d017ceb70fa8b13/554_337_3368_2021/master/3368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a82131984d2a7c6ef8d41d275ad561c","title":"visual poetry taking physical languages beyond the deaf community","story":"HereNot Here, a new film by Bim Ajadi, is aiming to bring the visual vernacular art form in to the mainstreamAddressing the camera, Ryan Pendley’s arms swipe the air, his hands fly with ferocity and pent-up frustration, his fingers crawl up his neck and clasp over his mouth. The subtitle explains, “like struggling to breathe”, but you hardly need the translation. What we’re watching looks like sign language, mime and dance rolled into one. It’s actually visual vernacular, or VV, an art form little known beyond the Deaf community (Deaf, with a capital D, refers to a distinctive culture as opposed to a solely audiological condition). And it’s part of a new film HereNot Here by director Bim Ajadi, that finds connections between three seemingly disparate physical languages: krump dance, football and British Sign Language (BSL).Ajadi, who is profoundly deaf, brings together these three passions of his in a bigger story about three groups of young people who clash over the use of an abandoned warehouse space, with a script by hip-hop theatre pioneer Jonzi D. Ajadi explicitly wanted to bring VV in to the mainstream. He calls it a form of visual poetry but he could see the connection with dance and its potential appeal beyond signers. “It’s a way of expressing visual vignettes,” he says, through an interpreter over a video call. He describes how Deaf people growing up in the 70s and 80s, watching television with no subtitles, would take the shows in visually “and almost have their own version of the story. And when they would communicate back to other Deaf friends they would describe that using VV.” The gestures can work like a storyboard, with cinematic effects, zooming in or out or switching between characters in a scene.VV has been around for decades and is more widespread in Europe and the US, where there are festivals, showcases and the ASL (American Sign Language) Slam, the equivalent of an MC battle. “But it’s definitely starting to grow within the Deaf community in the UK,” Ajadi says, “we’ve seen a surge in interest.”VV has similarities to krump, the powerfully explosive street dance style that appears in the film (led by dancer Theo ‘Godson’ Oloyade, part of a cast mixing pro and amateur actors). Both have a basic grammar and use improvisation around that, often in a battle format. In the film, the spark that links the two forms and unites the rival groups comes via tutting, a dance that uses deft and complex movements of the fingers to make images, symbols and patterns.Described as a “hip-hop drama”, HereNot Here comes with a message about overcoming our differences to find common ground and packs a lot of issues into 30 minutes: primarily the question of space, and who has it – so pertinent now during lockdown, but originally spurred by the closure Ajadi has seen of Deaf clubs and centres. It addresses how quick we can be to judge others. “I think that’s a common experience, especially in terms of race and certainly for the Deaf community,” says Ajadi. The awkwardness of first communication between Deaf and hearing characters isn’t something you see often on screen. “That was really important to me,” he says, “just in terms of representing how that communication can be brokered quite easily, I think that’s missing in a lot of mainstream film.”Ajadi, 45, who worked as a TV and film editor in post-production before making the move into film-making, wants to think beyond what’s typically expected of a Deaf director.

At a time of increasing conformity and commercialised ideas of beauty, the girls she had in mind were free-spirited and wild-haired making dens and hanging out in woods, messing about in rivers, smoking in parking lots, lost in languid afternoons, careless not only of the male gaze but any onlookers at all.Kurland started out on her quest in New Haven’s semi-industrial hinterland before travelling further afield over the next five years on a mazy road trip if the girls were on the margins, then she would be too. She loosely choreographed the groups of teenagers that she found, but mostly invited the girls into a promising setting and let them do their thing. She took this photograph of four girls in an abandoned car in the millennium year, and called it Shipwrecked. The girls she chose invariably understood the idea of the pictures. “I can always spot people,” she has said. “It’s, like, really one of my superpowers. I can always tell which teenage girls would love living in the woods with their friends.”She sees her work – collected in a book, Girl Pictures – in the tradition of American landscape photography of the 19th century, which put young frontiersmen into natural settings as a way of propagandising the idea of the west, and a vision of liberty. Her utopian scenes recreated that idealised political fantasy, and recast it for 21st-century women: courageous and vivid and sisterly. In a monograph for an exhibition of the pictures, she wrote how she tried to channel the raw energy of riot grrrl bands of that time into her portraits. “All the power chords we would ever need lay within reach, latent, coiled in wait…”Girl Pictures by Justine Kurland, with previously unpublished photographs, is out later this month (Aperture, £40)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b35880711966c841fe254d206f2438aae655ac0/75_761_3157_1892/master/3157.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44351be00f4e1f8126c59929739b4e4e","title":"anton chekhov russia travel greatest work of journalism 19th century","story":"The playwright’s arduous journey to a Pacific island in Russia’s far east resulted in a non-fiction masterpiecePassport details Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, playwright, one of the greatest short-story writers in history and once-in-a-lifetime adventurer to Russia’s remote far east.Place and date of birthTaganrog, southern Russia, January 29, 1860.Claim to fameDespite being best-known in the west as the author of plays in which members of the Russian gentry sit around waiting for the samovar to boil, Chekhov clearly had an intrepid streak. In 1890, despite having been diagnosed with tuberculosis, he undertook an extraordinary overland journey by train, carriage and riverboat to Russia’s far east. It took him two-and-a-half months to reach his destination: the North Pacific island of Sakhalin, north of Japan, and the penal colony there, which he described as hell.Supporting documentationChekhov spent three months on Sakhalin, carrying out a census and writing reports about the place that were published in a work of non-fiction that the New Yorker, no less, called the greatest work of journalism of the 19th century. He interviewed thousands of prisoners and settlers on the island in order to raise awareness of their predicament. The painstaking, courageous social activist that emerges from his writings about the trip is a corrective to the way we tend to see Chekhov outside Russia: as a writer preoccupied with all the flavours of middle-class misery. Journey to Sakhalin deserves to be better known and more widely read, but let’s face it, tales of a Russian prison colony at the other end of the world are always going to be a tough sell.Other adventuresChekhov’s expedition to Sakhalin was a bolt from the blue – a quixotic, uncharacteristic explosion of adventurousness similar to the impulse that propelled Bruce Chatwin from a comfortable job in Sotheby’s to Patagonia. Unlike Chatwin, Chekhov never repeated it. He did, however, enjoy the voyage home from Sakhalin, via Hong Kong, Singapore and Sri Lanka, where he unwisely acquired three mongooses that he ended up giving to a zoo. Distinguishing marksDapper, dandyish, a qualified doctor and proud of his work ethic, Chekhov comes across as charismatic and deeply likable. Of all Russia’s great writers, he’s the one you’d be best stuck on a long train journey with. Although, when you think about the alternatives (domineering Tolstoy, gambling addict Dostoevsky and Gogol, with his messianic theories about Russia), that’s faint praise.Last sightedChekhov’s health declined in the years after his return from Sakhalin. He finally succumbed to tuberculosis at a spa in Germany, where he’d gone in hope of a cure. Gorky records that his body was brought back to Moscow in a refrigerated carriage marked “for oysters”.Intrepidness ratingAlways with the numbers! Chekhov’s trip was tough, but not unprecedented. He undertook it because of his concern for the prisoners and what he felt the failures of the penal system said about his country. It was a noble aim, but perhaps not superlative in terms of pure exploration. I’m giving him a 610."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c446f0e1f0a2ce21341429c711bf1d1de98348f9/0_175_5257_3155/master/5257.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e448efb74131336581814cabe2f60ef","title":"ahmaud arbery father marcus georgia running","story":"Marcus Arbery Sr says Ahmaud’s death at the hands of two white men, while he was out for a run, was an act of racismMarcus Arbery Sr says his son was just like him, fit and athletic.Nearly everyone who talks about his youngest son, Ahmaud Arbery, remembers him running. Neighbors saw him jogging nearly every day. Ahmaud’s route would take him along the flat, curved road outside the home he shared with his mother, then into the unincorporated community of Satilla Shores on the Georgia coast just outside of Brunswick. Ahmaud would wave to the regulars on his route.“He just loved to work out and he just loved people,” his father told the .When the 25-year-old left for a run on a sunny February afternoon, he passed, for the last time, neighbors whose Ring alerts would go off as he raced by their homes. He would eventually meet Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son, Travis, 34. Shortly afterwards, Ahmaud was shot at least twice.For more than two months, Marcus Sr – along with his son’s siblings and mother – demanded answers. But as the case went through three district attorneys after the first two had to recuse themselves due to ties with Gregory McMichael, no one was charged in his son’s death.“We can’t have two different justice systems in America: one for black America and one for white America,” Ben Crump, the lawyer representing Marcus Sr, told the .That day in February, the McMichaels told police that Ahmaud matched the description of someone caught on a security camera committing a burglary in the neighborhood. This week, a leaked video appeared to contradict the elder McMichael’s statement to police insisting Ahmaud violently attacked his son.Gregory McMichael’s story also contradicts Marcus Sr’s memories of his son. “He was just a lovable young man and he would give you the shirt off of his back,” he said of the youngest of his three children, who would have turned 26 on Friday.“We’re talking about doing a celebration for him during the weekend,” Marcus Sr says. Thousands of people in Glynn county and across America also celebrated Ahmaud on Friday by doing something he loved: running. Near his mother’s house, people took the same route Ahmaud would run, walking or jogging 2.23 miles, representing the last day of Arbery’s young life.“We’re going to keep running for you, bro, until justice is served,” one of his friends posted on Facebook while jogging.Within two days of the release of the video of his death, after 10 weeks of local law enforcement failing to investigate, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation made arrests and promised to continue the investigation. The McMichaels were charged with murder and aggravated assault on Thursday, the day before Ahmaud would have turned 26.His father calls the shooting an act of racism by the McMichaels, who are white. The Arbery family is black. “I’ve dealt with racism my whole life here,” Marcus Sr says of the community. “Everybody’s supposed to be equal.”Though he doesn’t think that’s the way justice works in Glynn county, he hopes the shooting of his youngest child may be the catastrophic event that changes how this corner of Georgia operates.Even if that change does come, he says, it will be in exchange for his son’s life.“I got to live without my son and they lynched him. It’s just hard,” he said. “He didn’t deserve that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5eb407b5e1801cdd9274d064131f2fd5b0a362d/0_38_1962_1177/master/1962.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53c508cd839993af399218eb5fef729d","title":"move 1985 bombing reconciliation philadelphia","story":"Eleven people, including five children, died and a Philadelphia neighborhood burned down in the airstrike against a black liberation group. Now an effort at reconciliation is under wayFrank Powell, a Philadelphia police officer who in 1985 was chief of the city’s bomb disposal squad, remembers vividly the moment he was given his instructions. “Wow,” he recalls thinking. “You want me to do that?”On 13 May 1985 Powell was handed an army-style green satchel containing a bomb made of C-4 plastic explosives of the sort widely deployed in Vietnam. He boarded a state police helicopter, and took up his position balanced precariously on the skids of the aircraft.“I can’t remember being scared,” he told the , “though I must have been.”At 5.27pm as the helicopter rose into a crystal-clear blue sky he carried out his orders. Flying over a largely African American residential neighborhood of west Philadelphia, he lined up his sights, lit the 45-second fuse with a military igniter and followed his orders.“I reached out and I dropped it. Perfect. It was going right where it was supposed to go.”His target was the roof of 6221 Osage Avenue, a row house which at the time had 13 American citizens inside. They were all members of Move, a group which combined the black liberation struggle with back-to-nature environmentalism.Each Move member took the last name Africa to signal their commitment to race equality as well as to each other as a family. For years they had been in a running battle with the Philadelphia authorities culminating that May in arrest warrants, for a range of offenses including “terroristic threats”, “riot” and “disorderly conduct”, being served and a standoff ensuing that ended with the dropping of Powell’s bomb on to their house.It led to one of the great, largely forgotten, outrages of modern America.After the bomb struck, a fire told hold and began to spread. The police commissioner, Gregore Sambor, critically and fatally decided “to let the fire burn”.By the following morning 61 homes had been razed to ashes, leaving 250 Philadelphians destitute and homeless.Only two of the 13 residents of the Move house got out alive.The remaining 11, including five children aged seven to 13, were similarly reduced to ashes.As the 35th anniversary of the bombing approaches, efforts are under way to increase public awareness of the atrocity. It was only the second time in US history that American civilians were attacked on domestic soil by aerial bombing, after the dropping of dynamite on to African American homes in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the bloody race riots of 1921.Pressure is also mounting ahead of the anniversary for an apology to be issued by Philadelphia. Wilson Goode, the first black mayor of the city, who approved the 1985 attack though he claims to have been ignorant of key aspects of it, has said sorry on several occasions.But there has never been a formal apology from the city. No one involved in conceiving and carrying out the assault has ever been prosecuted.In an opinion article in the , Goode argues that it is now time for Philadelphia to follow his example and issue an official apology. Repeating his “deep and sincere” regrets, he calls on other former and current officials to join him in saying sorry for “indefensible” acts that led to a “horrific outcome”.“After 35 years it would be helpful for the healing of all involved, especially the victims of this terrible event, if there was a formal apology by the city of Philadelphia. Many in the city still feel the pain of that day – I know I will always feel the pain.”Goode’s  article is part of a wider two-year effort to bring opposing parties in the Osage Avenue bombing together in a process of “reconciliation”. The discussions, reported here for the first time, began in September 2018 and are ongoing.The negotiations involve both Move members and city dignitaries. On the city side, they include Goode and Ed Rendell, who was Philadelphia’s district attorney in 1985 and who served the arrest warrants that led to the bombing (he later went on to become governor of Pennsylvania).Rendell did not respond to  requests for comment. But he has approved a draft resolution of a city apology “for the decisions leading to the devastation that occurred on May 13th, 1985”.On the Move side, discussions have been led by Mike Africa Jr. He holds a special place in the Move family because he was born in a prison cell – his mother Debbie gave birth to him soon after she was arrested along with his father Mike Africa Sr in a previous police raid on a Move house in 1978.His parents both served 40 years in prison for the shooting death of a police officer, James Ramp, during the raid, although they along with all of their fellow incarcerated Move members always protested their innocence.Mike Africa Jr said that his many face-to-face meetings with Goode during the secret talks were “the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do”. His great uncle John Africa, the founder of Move, and his cousin Frank Africa both died in the 1985 fire.“Wilson Goode for me has always been the boogeyman,” Mike Africa Jr said. “After some meetings with him I came out literally vomiting. He’s the face of the bomb that killed my family, the man who said after the bomb was dropped that if he had to, he would do it again. So to sit in a room with him, even decades later, was gut-wrenching.”Mike Africa Jr said he disliked the phrase “reconciliation”, preferring “restorative justice”. The initial demand from Move was to have all the remaining seven members of the Move 9 who had been incarcerated after the 1978 siege released – an ambition fulfilled in February.Now Mike Africa wants to see the release of an associate of Move, the former Black Panther member Mumia Abu-Jamal who has been incarcerated since 1981 for the murder of a Philadelphia police officer. Africa also wants to see some form of reprimand for those who ordered and participated in the 1985 bombing.Other Move members are skeptical about the value of the talks. One of the doubters is Ramona Africa, who was the only adult to escape the Move house in May 1985 after Powell dropped the bomb.She told the  how she and 12 others cowered in the basement of Osage Avenue as the house came under blistering attack. Water cannons were unleashed, teargas pumped in, the front of the house blown off with explosives. Then more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition were fired from police submachine guns.And that was before the bomb was even dropped.“We were deluged with water and gas,” Ramona Africa told the . “When that didn’t work to bring us out of the house, they dropped the bomb. The whole house shook.”Ramona was able to flee through a basement exit along with just one child, Birdie Africa. The other 11 adults and children tried to follow them out but were forced back under a hail of police gunfire, she said, though that account has been disputed over the years by Philadelphia police.Ramona was badly burned in the fire. For her pains, she was arrested, charged with riot and conspiracy, and spent the next seven years behind bars – the only person ever to be convicted of crimes arising from the attack.Given her devastating experiences, she is dubious about the prospects of reconciliation. “We don’t want no apology,” she said. “They can’t make up for what they did, they can’t bring our people back who they murdered.”Janine Africa, one of the Move 9 imprisoned after the 1978 siege, lost her 12-year-old son Little Phil in the bombing. She described the boy to the  as “a very outgoing kid, very adventurous, a little comic”.Janine bitterly remembers how she learned that her child had diedwhile she was being held in solitary confinement (she was released almost exactly a year ago after 41 years in prison).She recalled: “The guard opened my cell door and said: ‘Your son is dead,’ then shut the door. That was it. No explanation. Nothing.”Janine Africa is also unconvinced by the push for an apology. “It’s really insulting to say you’re sorry now, after all these years,” she said.Despite such reservations, Ulysses Slaughter, a reconciliation strategist who has mediated the talks, is certain the process is needed to heal the wounds that are still open for so many Philadelphians. “The events of 1985 continue to silently traumatize people,” he said.“People need to ask themselves, what have we become as human beings when we allow our neighborhoods to become war zones.”Several of the more than 500 police officers who took part on the siege on 13 May 1985, as well as firefighters, have also been involved in the reconciliation talks.Jim Berghaier was on police duty in Osage Avenue that day and helped Birdie Africa escape the conflagration. He told the  that he is haunted by the image of the boy walking through a wall of fire.“Five kids died, and the neighbors lost everything. We failed, and it bothers me. Nobody ever seemed to care.”Berghaier said he only found out later that children had been present in the house. “Even to this day I carry a lot of guilt because of those five kids. I was only a wall away from them. People say to me, ‘But you didn’t know,’ but you can’t help thinking about it. They died a horrible death.”Linn Washington, who reported the events for the Philadelphia Daily News, believes it is long overdue for a formal recognition by the city of the grievous wrong done that day. “You can’t effectively move on until you find that kind of reconciliation. They killed five kids. The police commissioner called them ‘combatants’ – they were kids!”Jamie Gauthier, the city council member who represents the area of Osage Avenue today, is one of several current elected officials backing an apology. She told the : “To this day this represents one of the most heinous acts done by a city government against its own people – not just in Philadelphia, but in the entire country.”Paradoxically, the only person who the  talked to who said they have not had to wrestle with trauma over the past 35 years is the man who dropped the bomb.Frank Powell is convinced the fire that killed 11 people and devastated the area was not caused by the explosives in his satchel, but by the Move residents who, in his narrative, set fire to their own home in a deluded desire for suicidal martyrdom.“What we did that day has never bothered me,” he said. “I went up in that helicopter with the truest intentions of getting those people out unharmed. It didn’t happen that way, but it wasn’t our fault. I can live with that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdf617f07717788ea401e3bd0943c67e8a091ed9/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=b0524bb4c4970322267b7df89b12fe6a","title":"do you believe you were infected by coronavirus at a big event in march","story":"We’d like to hear from those who attended events between the end of February and early March such as Wolves v Eyol and Cheltenham FestivalWe’d like you to help us document the spread of coronavirus due to some of the mega-events that went ahead between the end of February and the first couple of weeks in March.

Hassan Nasrallah had traditionally focused on affairs closer to home but now found himself thrust to the vanguard of Iran’s interests in the region with a casting vote on who would best represent them.Last week, Kadhimi secured a government, thanks partly to Nasrallah’s endorsement. Yet throughout the horse-trading that eventually secured his cabinet line-up, the gaping hole exposed by Suleimani’s death was evident. “The Iranians and Iraqis are adrift,” said a source with close ties to Iraqi and Hezbollah officials. “The vacuum is as huge as it was when Hajj Qassem was buried.”Such was the void caused by the death of Suleimani – dubbed Hajj Qassem by friend and foe – that nearly all the regional projects that had been under way in his name at the time have faltered. Sources in Iraq, Syria and Yemen in particular suggest that Iran’s Revolutionary Guards, and the Quds Force that projects its core interests, are struggling to maintain momentum.Interviews with Iraqi and Lebanese officials show his replacement, Esmail Ghaani, struggling to assert his authority, even after doing the rounds of Iraq’s power base and the proxy networks that Suleimani had assembled over the 17 years of chaos that followed the US invasion.“He doesn’t speak the language, doesn’t have the history in the region, and – to be fair to him – has been given a mandate that he can’t deliver on,” said an Iraqi official with ties to the country’s national security apparatus. “He was in Afghanistan for 12 years and can’t be expected to know the ways of the Iraqi tribes, or how things have been done here since the Saddam years.”An image of Ghaani getting his beard trimmed during the Iran-Iraq war appeared on Iranian social media earlier this month, in an apparent attempt to make the new Quds Force leader more recognisable. On the same day, perhaps coincidentally, an Iranian publisher announced that Suleimani’s memoirs from the Iran-Iraq war, titled Our Blessed Comrade, would soon be released. Even as Ghaani’s backers tried to personalise him, his slain predecessor was eclipsing him from the grave.In Iran, Suleimani’s role – as intelligence chief, special forces commander and presidential envoy to supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei – has effectively been broken down. No one is likely to win such broad authority again. Without the weight of Suleimani, the Iranian-backed militia networks established over the past 17 years are proving difficult to manage.As Kadhimi edged closer to the top job, supported also by the US and Saudi Arabia, both of whom saw him as a leader outside of Iran’s grip on Iraq, he ran foul of one of Iraq’s most powerful militias, Kata’ib Hezbollah, which has accused him of facilitating the US operation that killed Suleimani, and their leader, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, on a Baghdad road in the early hours of 3 January.In a statement issued in early this month, the group said: “During the sensitive times we are going through, the brothers in politics who brought Mustafa al-Kadhimi to be prime minister-designate should know before it’s too late that the man is not up to the responsibility that has been given to him and is still accused of a crime of which he hasn’t been acquitted.”Weeks earlier, Kadhimi had sought a meeting with Keta’ib Hezbollah’s leadership under the auspices of Iraq’s president, where he tried to assure them that he had played no role in the deaths, but left open the possibility that an official in the Iraqi National Intelligence Service might have had contact with US spies.“The informal agreement was that they would not stop him from getting the job, but would continue to talk out against him,” said an official familiar with the conversation.“Kadhimi is facing so much pressure,” said an official connected to the Iraqi presidency. “There are rows between the Shia parties, who don’t see eye-to-eye on a lot. As for the Iranians, of course the loss of Muhandis and Qassem was a major blow they’re rearranging their structures now. But have they lost control? Not at all, the proof is their meddling in the formation.”With Kadhimi now Iraq’s premier decision-maker, US and Saudi officials are privately hailing a new era of Iraqi sovereignty. Washington pushed its allies in the country’s Kurdish north and Sunni centre to endorse him. “They think they’ve got their man,” a regional official said. “They’re celebrating. When will they ever understand Iraq?”Additional reporting by Mohammed Rasool"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5c2484a10c784ea3f599ab99f9885a4f9f4ebf6/0_130_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25191cdb46b2acba8e2337450018ea84","title":"pms plan to ease uk lockdown likely to be in line with wales","story":"Modest changes expected to include relaxing exercise rules and reopening garden centresBoris Johnson’s plans to ease the UK lockdown are likely to be in line with Wales, which would result in only modest changes such as the reopening of garden centres and libraries, and a relaxation of exercise rules, the Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said on Saturday.Drakeford said the prime minister’s announcement for England would be in line with the very smallest easing granted in Wales.The first minister said the transmission rate allowed only a very modest easing to permit more than one form of exercise per day, and for garden centres and libraries to reopen. “My view is we’ll be very much in line with one another,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.“Our new regime won’t come in until Monday, so we’ll move in a timely way together across the UK and I still think that is very much a preferable route.”Schools in Wales will not reopen to the majority of pupils until June, he added.Johnson is expected to take a cautious approach on Sunday, with official figures putting the UK death toll at more than 36,000. Plans to quarantine people entering the UK for 14 days and a move to building extra cycle lanes have also been leaked.Johnson is expected to say garden centres can reopen from Wednesday as long as social distancing measures can be enforced.The move will be welcomed by an industry devastated by the economic shutdown during its prime trading season. Retailers are preparing for a surge in plant and flower sales, which could help salvage a catastrophic year.Research for the Horticultural Trades Association last month found that, even with help in form of financial aid packages, a third of businesses are likely to be insolvent by the end of the year.Store owners will be responsible for ensuring social distancing rules are adhered to by shoppers, who will have to keep a distance of two metres from others. It is likely that shoppers will only be allowed to enter centres in controlled numbers, a policy already in place in supermarkets.Cleaning stations for baskets and trolleys, outdoor queuing systems and one-way aisles could limit contact between customers and staff. Perspex screens installed at staffed tills and self-checkouts could also help garden centres implement the required distancing restrictions.Cafes or playgrounds that are part of the stores will not be able to reopen.Although many of Britain’s 23 million gardeners will be delighted by the news, others have questioned whether garden centres should be given priority while many other parts of life remain under lockdown.A senior government source told PA Media: “Garden centres typically open large open-air spaces where the risk of transmission of coronavirus is lower. With strict social distancing measures in place we believe they can open safely from next week.”While allowing garden centres to reopen is part of measures that aim to gradually revive the economy, the environment secretary, George Eustice, said at the daily briefing on Friday expectations about a wholesale lifting of lockdown restrictions were misplaced. He stated that there “isn’t going to be any dramatic overnight change”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51dfa6720406600216efbc2fb33d0b8d559744c8/28_0_1247_748/master/1247.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66da3c54a3ded7598997fd5a3d45298c","title":"victory day belarus swaggers on parade as russians leave red square deserted","story":"In a tale of two cities, Moscow keeps its distance while in Minsk, thousands turn out for the traditional military spectacularBut on Saturday, the images of Soviet veterans and their families floated past on Russian television, a public vigil adapted for the era of social isolation.The coronavirus outbreak transformed Russia’s 9 May Victory Day celebrations, a holiday usually marked by family gatherings, memorials and an elaborate military parade on Red Square.Things looked very different in neighbouring Belarus, where elderly veterans and thousands more viewers packed on to bleachers for the usual military parade. Few were wearing masks.“This year, let the military parade in Minsk be the only one in the post-Soviet space,” boasted Alexander Lukashenko, the country’s president, who has publicly downplayed the dangers from the pandemic. The country has more than 22,000 cases of the disease and has recorded 126 deaths.He appeared to relish upstaging Moscow’s celebrations.“In this insane, disoriented world, there will be people who condemn us for the time and place of this sacred act,” he said defiantly. “Don’t rush to conclusions or condemn us, descendants of the victory of Belarusians. We couldn’t have acted differently. We had no other choice. And even if we had one, we would have done the same.”In Russia, however, where the tally of coronavirus infections on Saturday approached 200,000, and the capital’s climbed past 100,000, they chose to do it differently.City authorities in Moscow were desperate for people to stay at home, with police detaining several activists with flags marking the holiday at Pushkin Square.Vladimir Putin appeared in an overcast Moscow for the first time in more than a month to lay a bouquet of red roses at the Eternal Flame and vow to hold the parade as soon as possible. “We will, as usual, celebrate the anniversary widely and solemnly, and we will do it with dignity, as is our duty to those who suffered and achieved this victory,” he said. He was accompanied by a guard of honour and observed an airforce flypast, the only element of the military parade preserved this year.Elsewhere some of the most committed got creative. Volunteers in Novosibirsk climbed cherry-pickers to sing war ballads to veterans on their balconies. News programmes urged families to mount images of veterans on their windows and take part in a national moment of silence at 7pm, followed by a rendition of the song Victory Day from their balconies. The authorities hope an array of online concerts, digital museum tours and popular war films on TV will keep Russians occupied and off the streets.When all else fails, there are always reruns. A sports channels played repeats of Russia’s victories at a recent hockey tournament. And as soon as Putin finished his short visit to the Eternal Flame, the state television channel flipped over to footage of troops, tanks and other military hardware rolling across Red Square to mark the holiday in years past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b99420d45e0de91f80fde44f63432d9fa8feea3e/0_177_5295_3177/master/5295.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e3dcc147b498b508ecde66962aaf5ba","title":"belgium experiments with corona bubbles to ease social restrictions","story":"UK government also looking at scheme, but experts question whether it will workIt’s been called the four-person puzzle. If you could only have the same four family members or friends to dinner for a few weeks of coronavirus lockdown, who would you choose? That is the dilemma the Belgian government has handed its citizens as it moves to the next phase in easing restrictions on everyday life.From Sunday, every household in Belgium can invite up to four guests to their home. Two sets of four people make a “corona bubble”, who can visit each other’s homes. No one else is allowed into the domestic social circle. The concept, also being discussed by the British government, opens up the biggest social minefield of the coronavirus lockdown.Belgium’s prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, announced the plan last week, after being accused of prioritising the economy over people’s wishes to be reunited with friends and family. Allowing social bubbles to start on Sunday, Mother’s Day in Belgium and much of continental Europe, is no accident.“The physical separation from those whom we love has in some cases become unbearable,” Wilmès said, but visitors are told not to hug or exchange the typical three-kiss greeting. The government expects guests to stay 1.5 metres apart and suggests people meet in gardens or on terraces where possible. Authorities say it impossible to police the policy, so they are relying on people’s sense of civic duty.She lives in Brussels with her husband and two teenage daughters. “Do we elect a full family of four of whom they are our sole contact and we are their sole contact? That means I can’t allow any of my kids’ friends to visit them.”Her priority is to see her teenage son, who lives with his father and has asthma, meaning he has been isolated from the rest of the family. But she doesn’t want to cut her two daughters off from their friends. “I don’t intend to keep a flipchart of who is seeing who,” she said. “I think it is more important to get into the spirit of it than the letter.”There has been a lot of confusion about the letter of the policy. “The problem is that the way the idea was communicated was not very clear from the start,” said Karen Phalet, a professor in psychology at the Catholic University of Leuven. Many people did not realise that all four guests were meant to come from the same household.Epidemiologists advising the government chose the number four because it matches current capacity to do contact tracing if someone falls ill. Pairing two households also reduces the risk-multiplier effect that would come from allowing more varied mixing, but epidemiological models do not square with how people socialise in real life.“If one family can have contacts with one family for Mother’s Day, we have to make a choice, either the mother or the mother-in-law,” Phalet said. “It’s a hard choice for some families. Is it children’s friends? Is it parents or is it grandparents who have the priority?”She says the idea to connect just two households is not the way people normally socialise, and that raises questions about whether the policy can work: “If the distance between what people normally do and the restriction is too large I think it’s a bit risky.”Belgium’s “corona bubble” is similar to the German approach, where people from two separate households are allowed to meet from this weekend under the new relaxation of the country’s lockdown.Only one person per household was previously able to meet a person from another household.In theory, two families or two couples may now meet, providing they observe the 1.5-metre physical distancing rule and face coverings are worn if they meet outside.It has not been specified whether a family can meet up with one family on one day and another family the next. The assumption is that that is the case but it is yet to be clarified. These new rules will be in place until 5 June, by which time they will have been reviewed.In Spain, which has been under one of the strictest lockdowns in Europe, the government has said that groups of up to 10 people will be able to gather in private homes or outdoors from Monday, but only in areas of the country that have been given permission to move to the second phase of the lockdown de-escalation plan.On Mother’s Day, Phalet and her siblings will meet their 81-year old mother via Zoom.For now, the Belgian government’s main message is that people should stay at home as much as possible. “I am hoping that when contract tracing is in place we can get some social life back pretty soon in a way that is responsible,” Phalet said. “But we are not there yet.”Additional reporting by Kate Connolly in Berlin and Sam Jones in Madrid"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bcdb80765202015cdcd8f0af1a4bc41e08504af1/0_77_2910_1745/master/2910.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eccef75d31b920fa4b1490e2e0e34f61","title":"coronavirus america meat food system farming","story":"Supply chain problems and workplace infection risks mean experts are urging US producers to focus on sustainabilityAmericans are nearing a future where the nation’s beloved steak dinners, cheeseburgers and barbecue are under threat, if the world’s second largest meat processor is to be believed.Tyson Foods warned “the food supply chain is breaking” last week and said meat shortages were on the way to the US because the coronavirus pandemic was forcing it and other big companies to close several meat processing plants as their workforces became infected.But for some critical observers, the crisis in America’s huge industrial meat production sector came as no real surprise. Will Harris, a cattleman at White Oak Pastures in southern Georgia, said he always knew a “trainwreck” would hit the factory farming industry.Harris knows intimately how fragile factory farms and their supply chains can be, because for two decades, he raised cattle for the industrial beef production system. “For the past 70 years, big multinational corporations have moved our food system further and further down the road of focusing only on efficiency, only on taking costs out of production,” Harris said. “And in doing that they created a very fragile food system where a lot of things can go wrong.”But Harris said there is an alternative: his style of farming.Harris moved towards sustainability in the 1990s because of concerns about the environment and animal welfare. White Oak Pastures, which has $20m in annual sales to Tyson’s $42bn, has not sent panicked missives warning about meat shortages and is not being forced to kill its animals, as farmers who rely on corporate processing plants are.Instead, online sales have jumped fivefold it has hired 16 more full-time employees and any slowdown in processing will simply mean cows have more time to munch and meander in the grass.“We’re not bulletproof. I could have a lot of people get this sickness and have to close the plant. I hope not, but it could happen,” Harris said. “But we are doing all we can to prevent it, not just because of the economics of closing the plant but because we don’t want our people sick.”In a country where people consume on average more meat each day than the government recommends, the Covid-19 outbreak is far from catalysing a meat-free America.Instead, it’s exposing how fragile big meat’s supply chain is and making a case for smaller, more resilient models.“This virus is a warning shot, and it provides us with an opportunity to change our food system in ways that are less susceptible to disruption,” said Bob Martin, food system policy director at the Johns Hopkins Center for a Livable Future.Issues with factory farming are well-documented. Slaughterhouses are one of the most dangerous workplaces in the country employers often exploit a mostly immigrant workforce increasing line speeds threaten food and worker safety and meat consumption is a huge drain on the environment.The alternatives, meanwhile, appear to be thriving in the wake of the outbreak.White Oak is among the independent farms and butchers seeing a growth in business because of the outbreak. At Marksbury Farm in Kentucky, iniduals and grocery stores were seeking more of its grass-fed, antibiotic beef. Restaurants have been selling their supply direct to consumers, and other small farmers have turned to social media to do keep up with demand.The problem Tyson warned of is not actually a meat shortage, but a shortage of slaughter capacity.Workers at industrial slaughterhouses, who are overwhelmingly immigrants and people of color, are among the most vulnerable to Covid-19 because of their working conditions. At least 20 workers have died and more than 5,000 have been infected, forcing some slaughterhouses to shut.For operations like Tyson’s – which had capacity to process 45.6 million heads of beef, pork and poultry a week in 2019 – one plant closure can cause a glut of millions of chickens or thousands of hogs at one farm. Industrial farms don’t have the space or resources to keep these animals alive, and millions are expected to be euthanized in the coming weeks.Industrialization forced US farmers to be more dependent on slaughterhouses belonging to just four multinational corporations. In 1967, there were 10,000 state and federal inspected slaughter facilities across the country. Today, there are 2,700.A lobby which represents cattle farmers and ranchers, R-Calf USA, wrote to the White House urging it to consider restructuring the beef industry so there are more plants owned by more people. “This high level of physical and geographical concentration of America’s vital beef supply chain is intuitively and inherently contrary to America’s food security interests, as now unequivocally demonstrated by Covid-19,” the letter said.Despite Tyson’s warnings about meat shortages, executives painted a much rosier picture of their financial situation in an earnings call this week.The value of Tyson shares has fallen, but executives said the export business remains strong and they were recovering from a drop in sales to food service with a sharp increase in retail sales.Tyson’s chief executive, Noel White, said on the call: “We’re well-positioned to operate during this period and to take advantage of increasing demand during the recovery.”These statements are meant to assure investors, but they also highlight that the burden is falling on workers and the farmers they purchase from, not the people in the corner office.Experts said for a radical shift to take place, grassroots activists have to unite to overcome the immense economic and political power of the meat industry.The same day Tyson ran a full-page ad warning of a possible meat shortage, the Trump administration put the power to close or open a plant in the hands of the federal government, not local authorities. In an executive order, the administration also shielded companies from lawsuits by employees who contract Covid-19 .Although Republicans and Democrats are susceptible to meat industry lobbying, breaking up big meat became a popular position in the Democratic presidential race.Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren promised to strengthen laws to limit monopoly power in agriculture. Joe Biden has pledged to expand labor protections for agricultural workers and to reinstate safety protections rolled back by Trump.“This is an opportunity for meat-eaters to join together with sustainable producers of meat, and with meat and dairy industry workers, to all unite together and say we want a better system,” said Nina Ichikawa, executive director for the Berkeley Food Institute, which seeks to expand access to healthy, affordable food.Ichikawa said: “Covid-19 is making this more possible because we all have this collective fear of Covid-19, and we have collective vulnerability, so all our eyes are turning to meatpacking.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/39a62aa6bb20a0bb708e1ae146956a2a41dd8344/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=53effc07cc36de3c7c5724ffb801ef24","title":"coronavirus latest at a glance may 10","story":"A summary of the biggest developments in the global coronavirus outbreakKey developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:Global coronavirus cases stand at 4,024,973, according to the Johns Hopkins tracker, with global deaths at 279,321.

At 7pm BST on Sunday, British prime minister Boris Johnson is expected to announce a gradual easing of lockdown restrictions, but some scientists are worried about a second wave of the virus. According to the report the PM has been warned of having “very little room to manoeuvre” by his top scientific advisors and told Britain could suffer more than 100,000 deaths by the end of the year if ministers relax the lockdown too far and too fast, the paper reports a scientific adviser telling the government last night.New coronavirus infections are accelerating again in Germany just days after its leaders loosened social restrictions, raising concerns that the pandemic could once again slip out of control.

But their population was devastated by decades of starvation and diseases, and when she died in 1829, Shanawdithit was believed to be the last of her line.New research from Memorial University, however, has found Beothuk DNA probably still exists in people alive today – a discovery that would rewrite the history of the Newfoundland’s early inhabitants, even as it confirms the accuracy of local First Nations oral tradition.“We’ve got good evidence that we have genetic continuity from the Beothic into modern persons,” said biologist Dr Steve Carr.But while the finding would trigger a rethink for historians, the notion is not surprising to local Indigenous groups.Mi’kmaq oral history has long asserted a shared ancestry with the original inhabitants of Newfoundland, and local First Nations have worked closely with Carr to help lend genetic evidence to their own traditions.“There were always connections or friendly relations going back more than 200 years ago and when you mingle that way, periodically, things would happen,” said Chief Mi’sel Joe of the Miawpukek Mi’kamawey Mawi’omi, a Mi’kmaq First Nation in Newfoundland.Historians believe the Beothuk are descended from a group that braved the ocean to cross from Labrador to Newfoundland thousands of years ago and whose distinct culture emerged around 1500 CE. At one point, as many as 2,000 Beothuk lived in communities scattered around Newfoundland.For generations, they largely resisted and avoided relations with European settlers the few interactions between the two were defined by violent encounters.Early European settlements on the coast cut off Beothuk access to critical salmon and seals – forcing them to move further inland where they sustained themselves on caribou before finally succumbing to starvation and disease.But Carr’s research suggests it was only a “cultural extinction” their genetic legacy lives on.In his study, Carr used DNA samples from Shanawdithit’s aunt and uncle – Demasduit and Nonosbawsut – whose skulls were taken to the Royal Museum in Scotland in 1828. After a long campaign by Chief Joe’s community, the remains were repatriated to Newfoundland in March.After running samples through a genetics database, Carr was able to find his “smoking gun” – a man in Tennessee who was genetically similar to Nonosbawsut, but had no known Indigenous ancestry.With is only a small amount of data to work with, Carr hopes more samples will further demonstrate a connection.“It’s easy to obtain the DNA sequence from somebody and you can count the number of similarities. That’s a very easy thing to do. But to reconstruct the patterns of a relationship is a very challenging problem,” said Carr, adding that further research into the known movement and connections between the Beothuk and Mi’maq was still required.The findings also illustrate the way in which genetic uniqueness – in this case the distinct sequence of Beothuk mitochondrial genomes – can persist intact for generations. While humans share an immense amount of DNA that traces back millennia, said Carr, the intent of his research lay in teasing out the subtle and distinguishing differences between known groups.For years, academia has ignored the oral histories of Indigenous peoples, said Chief Joe.“Academics are hard people to convince. They often have this mindset that ‘this the way it was’ – no matter what information we give them to the contrary,” he said.He described a frustrating experience in a land claims court, where the adjudicator suggested the Mi’kmaq first arrived in Newfoundland in the 1700s.“But we have an oral history of British sailors meeting our people and asking for directions. We drew them a map on birch bark. If this is the first time we had ever been on the land, how could we draw a map?” said Joe.“It’s convenient for government, for everyone, to ignore people who had no written history”The community is excited to keep working with Carr on further testing, said Joe, to further strengthen the evidence of shared ancestry.“This is a big thing for us,” he said. “But it all comes from something we already knew.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abcf3a9063d02699320bf3278ffdd25d5d3539de/0_351_5294_3178/master/5294.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a971f9327069548307d3e7c7f0f2a6bf","title":"it isnt over south korea records 34 new cases the highest in a month","story":"Twenty-six of the new coronavirus cases were domestically transmitted, including 14 in SeoulSouth Korea has reported 34 new coronavirus cases, the highest daily number in a month, after a small outbreak emerged around a slew of nightclubs that a confirmed patient had visited.Of the new cases announced on Sunday, 26 were domestically transmitted infections and eight were imported cases, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.The total was the highest since 9 April. After battling the first major epidemic outside China, South Korea posted zero or very few domestic cases over the past 10 days, with the daily tally hovering around 10 or less in recent weeks.The resurgence followed a small but growing coronavirus outbreak centred around a handful of Seoul nightclubs, which a man in his late 20s had visited before testing positive for the virus.At least 15 people were traced to that man as of Friday, and 14 of the 26 cases were reported from Seoul on Sunday, although the KCDC did not specify how many were linked.The outbreak prompted Seoul city to impose an immediate temporary shutdown of all nightly entertainment facilities on Saturday. The city said it is tracking down about 1,500 people who have gone to the clubs, and has asked anyone who was there last weekend to self-isolate for 14 days and be tested.The outbreak came just as South Korea has eased some social distancing restrictions and is seeking to fully reopen schools and businesses in line with a transition from an intensive social distancing campaign to what it calls “distancing in daily life”.President Moon Jae-in warned of a second wave of the epidemic later this year, saying the recent cluster underscored the risks that the virus which causes Covid-19 can spread widely again at any time.“It’s not over until it’s over. While keeping enhanced alertness until the end, we must never lower our guard regarding epidemic prevention,” he said in a televised speech marking the third anniversary of his inauguration.“We are in a prolonged war. I ask everyone to comply with safety precautions and rules until the situation is over even after resuming daily lives.”Widespread testing, intensive contact tracing and tracking apps have helped Asia’s fourth largest economy largely contain the epidemic without extensive lockdowns seen elsewhere.As part of a long-term battle on Covid-19, the KCDC will be given greater power and renamed the Disease Control and Prevention Administration, Moon said. Local governments will set up their own epidemic response systems with more experts.“We will also push to establish hospitals specialised in treating infectious diseases and a national infectious disease research centre,” Moon said.“These tasks are very urgent if we are to prepare for the second epidemic wave that experts predict will hit this fall or winter.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3933abb4af5414dab701afadbcb86dd053db3cc/0_78_2300_1380/master/2300.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fac1ee30c81680c7d3b64172904525ea","title":"nicola sturgeon leads criticism of uks new stay alert coronavirus lockdown advice","story":"Ahead of Boris Johnson address, Labour says latest messaging risks making people think lockdown is overNo 10 has clarified its new “stay alert” advice will still ask people to stay at home as much as possible and keep 2 metres apart in public, after Nicola Sturgeon led criticism of the slogan for being unclear about whether the lockdown is over.Downing Street faced a chorus of disapproval after replacing its advice to stay at home with the new “stay alert” instruction, with the leaders of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all saying they wanted to stick with the original message.Ahead of an address to the nation at 7pm on Sunday, Boris Johnson confirmed the advice would change, but tweeted out a clarification of what “stay alert” would mean, after critics said it was meaningless and vague.The government said the new principles of “stay alert” were:More specific details are to be set out by the prime minister on Sunday evening, but the first steps of loosening the lockdown are likely to be allowing unlimited outdoor exercising within household groups and the reopening of garden centres this week.The government briefed the latest “stay alert” messaging to the media overnight, ahead of Johnson’s speech about easing the lockdown. But in a sign the UK’s “four nations” approach is fracturing, Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, said she had been given no advance sight of the slogan. “The Sunday papers is the first I’ve seen of the PM’s new slogan. It is of course for him to decide what’s most appropriate for England, but given the critical point we are at in tackling the virus, #StayHomeSaveLives remains my clear message to Scotland at this stage,” she said.Vaughan Gething, the Welsh health minister, said there had been no agreement from the devolved administrations and stressed the message for Wales “has not changed: stay at home and if you do go out observe the social distancing rules”.Arlene Foster, the first minister of Northern Ireland, also said it was right to the stay with the original slogan. She told the BBC: “On the whole, the message is to stay at home. We will say we are not deviating from the message at this time.”Labour said the “stay alert” messaging risked people thinking the lockdown was over, with people already having flocked to parks, beaches and street parties over the warm bank holiday weekend.Speaking to Sky News, Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary, defended the slogan, saying the time was right for the UK to start gradually getting back to work as normal as the coronavirus epidemic is past its peak.Jenrick acknowledged the virus “continues to be prevalent, too many people are still dying of this and we’re going to have to live with it for a long time”.But he told the Ridge on Sunday programme it was right to “update and broaden” the message to the public.“I think that’s what the public want and that they will be able to understand this message, which is that we should be staying home as much as possible but when we do go to work and go about our business we need to remain vigilant, we need to stay alert,” he continued.“And that means things like respecting others, remaining 2 metres apart, washing your hands, following the social distancing guidelines because the virus continues to be prevalent, too many people are still dying of this and we’re going to have to live with it for a long time.”Jenrick said the message had to be changed to encourage people to resume their roles at work while staying safe. It follows concerns in the Treasury about the huge numbers of people who have been furloughed at a cost of £8bn by 3 May.“We’re not going to take risks with the public. I understand people are anxious about the future but we want now to have a message which encourages people to go to work,” he said.“Staying home will still be an important part of the message but you will be able to go to work and you will in time be able to do some other activities that you’re not able to do today.”Pressed if there was a danger the message was too woolly, Jenrick said: “Well, I hope not. We need to have a broader message because we want to slowly and cautiously restart the economy and the country.”The difficulties of conveying the message were underlined when Jenrick was pressed on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show about what it meant. He said: “Stay alert by staying home as much as possible, but stay alert when you do go out by maintaining social distancing, washing your hands, respecting others at work.”Opposition politicians and some scientists said the slogan was too unspecific and would leave people thinking they no longer need to stay at home.Ashworth also told Sky the country needed clarity from the government on how they were meant to act as there was “no room for nuance” when dealing with a life-threatening virus.“The problem with the slogan is that people will be looking at it slightly puzzled,” he said.Ian Blackford, the SNP leader in Westminster, said: “What kind of buffoon thinks of this kind of nonsense? It is an invisible threat. Staying alert is not the answer.”Prof Simon Wessely, regius professor of psychiatry at King’s College London and director of the health protection research unit in emergency preparedness and response, said it was difficult to know what “stay alert” meant, adding: “Research in similar situations shows that what the public most want is specific guidance on what to do and what not to do. I am not sure how this answers that.”Prof Til Wykes, vice-dean of the institute of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience at King’s College London, agreed. He said: “It will just be confusing, be open to misinterpretation and likely to increase risky behaviour – that means taking risks that will affect everyone and increase infections,” she said.However, the government’s move to start reopening the economy won praise from some Conservative backbenchers who have been pressing for an end to the lockdown. David Davis, the former Brexit secretary, said he believed the government should allow “people to rely more on common sense than blanket rules”.Jenrick also explained the government would adopt a new “five-level” threat system to describe the risk the UK faces from coronavirus.“At the moment we believe the country is at four on a scale of five, with five being the most concerning and our aspiration is to bring that down as swiftly as we can to three,” he said.“And at each stage, at each of those milestones, we will be in a position to open up and restart more aspects of the economy and of our lives.”The decision over when and how to lift the lockdown has been the subject of a huge battle within the cabinet and the wider Tory party.Johnson has been on the cautious side of the argument, along with the health secretary, Matt Hancock, with cabinet ministers Michael Gove, Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss, as well as many other Tory MPs, among those pushing for more thought to be given to the economic consequences.With tensions running high, the Mail on Sunday reported a row between Johnson and Hancock, who is said to have asked the prime minister to “give me a break” over the pressure he was feeling about the crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a3bd21cf003cd3e6fbcb49cf53f626fe6a71757/0_164_4902_2942/master/4902.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63e5b44088a49b4ea3f8ae7ff0b29292","title":"people feel a bit nervous france braces for end of lockdown paris","story":"As schools and businesses get set to reopen some citizens urge caution, wary of a spike in infectionsFrance is set to end eight weeks of strict lockdown as the government urged people to behave responsibly to avoid a sudden spike in coronavirus cases.Hours before the national déconfinement there were reports of two new Covid-19 clusters in départments designated green – areas where the virus has largely stopped circulating and where most restrictions are being lifted.Many of the country’s primary and nursery schools are gearing up to restart classes this week, while people will be able to leave home without having to carry sworn attestations.Business are being encouraged to open but staggering working hours to avoid crowding on public transport and in offices.The Paris region – which remains designated red because of the continuing threat from the virus – will remain under stricter regulation and workers are being encouraged to continue working from home where possible.Anyone using public transport will be required to wear a mask and peak-hour metros, buses and trams are reserved for essential workers.While many were happy to see the end of the “stay home” rule others were more cautious. France has had more than 139,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, resulting in at least 26,300 deaths, according to official figures.On the busy rue des Martyrs in Paris’s central 9th arrondissement, shoppers welcomed the end of the lockdown but urged caution.“I think the difference is going to be mainly psychological,” said Noémi Bélanger, 44, an insurance company employee who will continue working from home. She is still waiting to learn if her children will return to school this week.“It will be nice to be able to leave the house without justifying why, stay out longer than an hour and start seeing friends again,” she said. “But it’s not like life will be normal again. I don’t think we’ll all suddenly start inviting each other round again. Cafes and restaurants are still shut, parks are closed. It’ll all take time. People feel a little bit nervous.”Anthony Gaubert, 34, who runs a web marketing company, said: ”The virus is still very active in the Paris region. We should all be careful, or we’ll be going straight back into lockdown.”Annie Poquelin, 71, said: ”Of course everything has to start up again … but look, the masks, the hand gel, shop assistants behind screens. It’s not like before, is it?”The French government has insisted the return to normal will be “progressive” and ministers have repeatedly urged the population to maintain social distancing and barrier measures. Last week, the prime minister, Édouard Philippe, called on the population to abide by the “spirit” of new regulations, which ban anyone travelling more than 100km outside their départment without a “compelling reason”.However, in Pont-L’Éveque in Normandy, where many city-dwellers have second homes, locals complained Parisians were already breaking the travel rules.“The areas around Pont-L’Éveque have suddenly become inundated with Parisian number plates. Second homes that were closed up are now all opened and the village is teeming,” one local said.“Previously we have seen gendarmes at tolls issue fines, turning people around and sending them back … now frienda are seeing Parisians wandering around all over the place.”He added: “With the new clusters breaking out and the insufferable arrogance of many Parisians, I fear we will shortly be changing colour (from green to red).”The person, who did not want to be named, said an elderly couple contracted Covid-19 after a family from Paris “nipped down for an illegal weekend” and asked the local woman to do some cleaning.After two new clusters emerged in the Dordogne and the Vienne départments, officials insisted the country must not lower its guard against the virus.One outbreak in the Dordogne was traced back to the funeral of a 51-year-old man in the small village of L’Eglise-Neuve-de-Vergt – population 500 – south of Périgueux. While only 20 people were invited, dozens more turned turned up to the cemetery and wake, some from Switzerland and Portugal from where the dead man originated.After one person present complained of Covid-19 symptoms, the regional health agency identified, traced and tested a total of 127 people so far nine have tested positive. The results of 63 tests are still not known.Local prefect Frédéric Périssat said the cluster was an “illustration of what we are hoping not to live through in the next few weeks”.“There’s a slackening off, people gather in a group of 20 or 30 and one person contaminates others,” Périssat said at a press conference.A second cluster was reported at a secondary school in Vienne in south-west France, where four people tested positive after a staff meeting to prepare for the reopening of classes on 18 May. The school is delaying reopening until 27 May.The French lockdown began at noon on 17 March."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee2d74041945ddeb7fcb08963ca7966b0c4e3ea1/0_249_4536_2719/master/4536.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23c2ed5fc8e1f54d90d71125eb7e8413","title":"theyre making it up as they go along confusion dilutes lockdown message","story":"With picnics tolerated and even a pub doing takeaway drinks, it seems few in Hackney are obeying the stay-at-home ruleAs the mounted police approached, the group leapt up from their picnic, clearly fearing the worst. They were wrong. Grinning, the officer encouraged them to enjoy the sun and suggested that if the park became too crowded they should consider leaving.For people sunning themselves in London Fields, Hackney, the incident signified another unheralded shift in the UK’s coronavirus lockdown strategy. “Two days ago, police were confiscating beer from drinkers’ hands,” said media consultant Gavin Jamieson, 34. “Weeks before that, they were turning up in vans and telling people to leave the park.”It was obvious, added his friend Adrian Wilson, 37, that the politan police had finally abandoned the government’s emergency lockdown measures as unenforceable. “There’s a clear disconnect between the police and the government,” said Wilson. “Boris Johnson has completely muddied the water on what we’re all meant to be doing.”Further south on Hackney’s Broadway Market, further confusion reigned – just 17 hours before Johnson was scheduled to outline his “roadmap” for ending coronavirus restrictions. Aurelie Legrand, 22, a physiotherapist from France, said: “There are so many competing messages that people have decided for themselves that the lockdown has ended.” Gesturing to the passing throng, she said: “Look around you!”On the pavement, red lines outside shops attempted to enforce social distancing for those queueing. By 10am, at least 15 couples were in a carefully spaced line outside a butchers.An hour later, the temperature had nudged into the 20s. The crowd grew. Garfield Bascombe surveyed the scene with a wan smile. The 55-year-old is Broadway Market’s inaugural social distancing inspector. It is his duty to ensure lockdown measures are obeyed in one of the busiest streets in a London borough with the third-highest coronavirus death rate in England and Wales.Yet Bascombe estimated he only had to intervene a handful of times each day, despite the thousands moving through the thoroughfare.“So far so good. Most people are listening to the advice of the government. People have got the message: keep your distance!”Some, though, admitted they had no clue what the message was. Government sources last week raised the prospect of picnics with pals and sunbathing in the park ahead of the hot bank holiday weekend. The briefings induced newspaper headlines declaring “Lockdown freedom” – and equally rapid counter-briefings that the easing of restrictions would be minimal.“I just hope the new messaging is a lot clearer: their approach does undermine my confidence,” said lecturer and artist Alex Hanna, 56. His graphic designer wife, Elaine, 52, was more abrupt. “It feels like they are making it up as they go along,” she said.Nearby, clutching a takeaway coffee, Georgina Davies, 26, an interior designer from Byron Bay in Australia, wondered at the furtiveness surrounding public health guidance. “They are a bit tight-lipped on what exactly people should be doing.”The ambiguity was articulated by the rarity of face masks among the visitors to London Fields. Johnson has admitted that scientists think masks might help stop the spread of coronavirus, but there has been no change to government advice that they are not required outside medical and care settings.One frequent wearer was 30-year-old care worker Gevon Beckford, who said that although his peers were complying with the lockdown, restlessness was building. “Some are getting a bit frustrated. There’s a lot of uncertainty.” Beckford has made 15 home visits a day for six days a week since the start of the pandemic and appreciates that his job carries danger. When told that official figures last week revealed that black people were four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than white people, he exhaled sharply: “Whoa, I didn’t know that.” Elsewhere, others sensed that the government’s messaging has been too weak, given what they should know about human nature. “People have a need to be extrovert, to be sexy, to socialise, and these are taking precedence over safety,” said Martin Adams from Essex.Away from Hackney, evidence of lockdown fatigue has emerged across the UK. The Coastguard reported the highest number of call-outs since lockdown began, evidence that people had started to ignore the stay-at-home message.In Manchester, tensions were running high after dozens of people were pictured sitting together soaking up the sun outside a bar. At Heaton Park in the north of the city, officials were pictured trying to stop visitors having picnics and barbecues.In Cornwall and Devon, where traffic has been steadily building, police “encouraged” residents and visitors who have concerns about gatherings to immediately contact them.Back on Broadway Market, as the afternoon temperature climbed on Britain’s seventh lockdown weekend, the Dove pub began serving takeaway alcoholic drinks in an initiative that Hackney’s mayor has branded “unacceptable”.Jamieson disagreed. “People need to congregate, to express themselves. Sometimes they need to live for today.”The government’s rules for protection against Covid-19 are based on a series of assumptions about the virus that causes the disease. In the few months that this virus has been known to science, these are the rules that have been devised, writes Robin McKie. Keeping two metres apart: This distance is based on the fact that droplets coughed out by a human being will travel no more than two metres before falling to the ground. It is assumed that virus-laden droplets are a key method of the airborne transmission of the disease. However, smaller aerosols may be responsible for spreading some virus particles, though it is not yet clear if they carry enough to trigger an infection in another person. Tests to find out are now under way in laboratories.Face masks: The non-specialist face masks on sale in the UK are generally not designed to protect the person wearing them but to protect others. “They are designed to catch what you breathe out, not what you breathe in,” says Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. “The worry is that people will wear them thinking they cannot be infected, and will not feel they have to take other precautions.”It is safer outside: “Imagine setting fire to a newspaper inside your flat,” says Finn. “The smoke will hang around for hours. Do it in the open air and the smoke will be wafted high into the air in minutes. And so it will be for virus-carrying droplets hanging in the air. They will dissipate very quickly outdoors and very slowly indoors.”The 15-minute rule: According to Public Health England, a quarter of an hour is the maximum time you should spend in conversation with someone you’re not sharing lockdown with. This is based on observations of the behaviour of other airborne microbes. These indicate that 15 minutes is the average time you can spend in safe conversation without breathing in virus-laden droplets.Washing your hands: The evidence is very clear. The virus that causes Covid-19 has a coat covered with chemicals called lipids, and these are rapidly made inactive by soap and water. “By washing your hands carefully as often as possible, you can halt the spread of the virus which you can pick up when touching infected surfaces. It is as simple as that,” says Finn."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4241807.1588238327!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"does it matter whether my plants listen to mozart or bach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSwinging back the polytunnel door, I wish its leafy occupants a cheery good morning and ask them how they’re doing. Illustration: Michael VineyMy painting below shows the polytunnel, with attendant gardener, in another good summer years ago. I’m still down there soon after breakfast, carrying the radio for Lyric, to tend a rather less ambitious vegetable array.As always, swinging back the tunnel door, I wish its leafy occupants a cheery good morning and ask them how they’re doing. On further inspection, I may murmur some encouragement to a row of climbing beans, praise the mangetout vines for their first purple flowers and the Russian tomatoes for their yellow ones.The streak of animism that tempers my appetite for science allows an amiable connection with plants I have raised from seeds. This lent some fellow feeling with Prince Charles when, years ago, he confided that he always talked to plants in his greenhouses, adding that it was “very important – they respond”.His incautious remarks came in the wake of an American book, The Secret Life of Plants (1973), which offered “the physical, emotional and spiritual relations between plants and man”. Mixing legitimate science on plant senses and behaviour with subjective experiment and spiritual folklore, it achieved a heady readability that earned much media praise and a considerable nod from public culture.Scientists seeking acceptance of the new view of plants met much sceptical reaction that jeopardised funding for their work. With the book’s authors now dead (neither of them were scientists), the popular case for plant senses and intelligence now has impeccable champions.From Israel, for example, plant geneticist Daniel Chamovitz offered What a Plant Knows: A Field Guide to the Senses of Your Garden and Beyond (2012), of which a generous list is online as a PDF. It persuaded me that whether Lyric plays Mozart or Bach to my polytunnel plants, they are probably deaf to either. Even talking to them just offers a fleeting, if benevolent, breath of CO2.At Chamovitz’s Tel Aviv University, on the other hand, new experiments described by Itzhak Keit show that tomato and tobacco plants stressed by drought or being cut emit ultrasonic airborne sounds detectable several metres away. If the pinching out of shoots from the oxters of my tomatoes elicits squeals of protest, I am mercifully unable to hear them.Plant intelligence rests in the demonstrable awareness and responses by which they solve their problems. Rooted they may be, but hardly static, as the many online time-lapse films of growth – the ballet of seedling beans, the thrust of elongating briars – make enchantingly clear.If they show no special taste in music, they may indeed recoil from its vibrations. They hear approaching insects and react to the munching of caterpillars by flooding leaves with deterrent chemicals. They smell such signals of alarm released by their neighbours.This is now established in plant science, much of it easily accessible online. It readily bows to the early work of Charles Darwin among the pots of plants in his study: runner beans, cucumbers, nasturtiums, hops anything that climbed and moved.Darwin worked with son Francis to study the cellular search-and-curl movement (they called it “circumnutation”) of climbers twirling up poles. As Francis told a science assembly in Dublin: “We must believe that in plants there exists a faint copy of what we know as consciousness in ourselves.” This has developed into today’s “plant neurobiology”, a term disparaged by those scientists who save anything “neuro” for the human brain and its neurons.It was the Darwins, in their book The Power of Movement in Plants, who proposed that the tiny tip of the embryo root, first to emerge from the seed, “acts like the brain of one of the lower animals”. Its sensitivity, multiplied at the tips of branching roots, serves as a network of perception and command that guides their navigation through the soil.Richard Karban in the US and Anthony Trewavas in Scotland are two more of today’s notable scientists absorbed with plant intelligence. But the most vigorous and prolific proponent of the “root-brain hypothesis” is Italy’s Prof Stefano Mancuso at Florence University. Of his lectures on YouTube, “The roots of plant intelligence” in the Ted series is a specially engaging.Along with scientific enlightenment comes Mancuso’s challenge to human habits in viewing the life of the planet. Some 99 per cent of Earth’s biomass, as he argues, is that of plants, yet humans have ignored their intricate networks of consciousness, granting active intelligence only to an animal brain.In a corner of the polytunnel, a chair is propped in a bank of fading wallflowers, next to the early potatoes. I rest there, circled by bumblebees, to ponder such reproaches to human history. Our tight co-evolution and reliance on plants, Mancuso observed recently, “might raise the question of who actually domesticated whom”."},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

You could try and enforce it but you would never get very far, they would just down tools and say ‘you can’t force me’.”Marking and grading work is also important to keep children motivated, the headteacher said, adding: “I don’t really understand what the unions have against that.  If you are not marking the work, children won’t see the point of doing it.  “At the end of the day, children should be at the forefront of our thinking. This is not a one off, it’s a national emergency, you would think the unions would be a bit more understanding of that.”The NEU has issued two sets of guidelines for distance teaching and learning during the coronavirus pandemic, one for primary teachers and another for secondary teachers.“Teachers should not live-stream lessons from their homes, nor engage in any video-calling unless in exceptional circumstances, with the parent,” the primary school guidelines said.“Online lessons are not desirable for primary children as the teacher-pupil interaction is not easily replicated.”  Meanwhile, the secondary school advice document states: “If schools have systems set up for online lessons, these should be kept to a minimum as the interaction needed between teacher and pupils in school is high and cannot be easily replicated for a young audience, even at KS4 level.“Any school which carries out online lessons must have protocols in place to protect staff and safeguard pupils, and no teacher should be expected to carry out any online teaching with which they feel uncomfortable or in the absence of agreed protocols.”  One parent, who complained to her child’s school about the lack of work, said that she found the answer that teachers were refusing to set work online “infuriating”.  “Parents are desperately trying to struggle with working from home,” she said. “I found the fact that its unions blocking it to be really shocking.  Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, defended the guidelines and said that his members are working “flat out” to support students.The guidelines are aimed at managing the workload and stress of children, parents and teachers, he said, adding that they are “not about preventing learning”.  Mr Courtney said: “Arrangements for online learning must also protect teachers\u0027 and childrens\u0027 privacy and ensure children are kept safe while online. The NEU is supporting teachers and families to do the best they can with the resources available to them.  “We are suggesting ways of providing creative packs for younger pupils, and access to real books and printed resources - because online learning simply is not accessible for many pupils, too many have limited access to laptops or quiet space in which to view lessons at set times of day.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"us uk intelligence agencies examining report mobile phone data","story":"US and British intelligence agencies are reportedly examining mobile phone data suggesting there could have been an emergency shutdown in October at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.According to a report, obtained by NBC News, there was no mobile phone activity in a high-security part of the Chinese laboratory complex from Oct 7 to Oct 24. Previously, there had been consistent use of mobile phones.The report, carried out by private experts, suggested there may have been a hazardous event, specifically at the institute\u0027s National Biosafety Laboratory, between Oct 6 and Oct 11.Analysis of mobile phone data from the area surrounding the institute also suggested roadblocks were in place between Oct 14 and Oct 19.Experts urged caution over the report, suggesting it may be based on only limited commercially available mobile phone data, and that there could be other reasons for varying levels of phone usage.However, the document could be what Donald Trump was referring to when the president recently said he had seen evidence giving him a high degree of confidence the pandemic began accidentally at the Wuhan laboratory.The prevailing theory is that the virus originated in bats and crossed over to humans at a market in Wuhan.But US intelligence agencies continue to investigate the Wuhan laboratory and Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has said there is a significant amount of evidence.It was unclear which private organisation carried out the leaked analysis of the mobile phone location data.But the 24-page report suggested it supports the release of Covid-19 at the Wuhan Institute of Virology and that the pandemic began earlier than previously thought.

Of those, 21 died in traffic accidents, 11 were trapped with snares, 10 were shot, three were poisoned, two were strangled and one died from an infection.“This is a breed that has been used in the region for centuries,” Deli Saavedra, a regional manager for Rewilding Europe, told The .“The wolf population in the region is small and scattered at the moment but when it grows there will be the potential for conflict. The dogs are big animals and they are capable of protecting the sheep.”The conservationists are also trying to boost the number of roe deer in the region, to provide the wolves with a source of wild prey rather than livestock. “If wolves have a choice, they always go for wild animals rather than domestic animals,” said the ecologist.The first Estrela mountain dog puppy to undergo training is called Leão, meaning lion in Portuguese.He is just a few months old now but once fully-grown, at 18 months, he will spend his days and nights protecting sheep from wolves.“The target is to eventually embed 100 dogs with flocks and herds in the project area,” said Sara Aliácar, from Rewilding Portugal.“A shepherd with Serra da Estrela dogs can guard against wolf predation far more effectively than one without.”With large tracts of the region in north-eastern Portugal abandoned by farmers over the years, Rewilding Europe wants to return hundreds of thousands of hectares to their natural state.That would encourage the return not just of the wolf but other signature species such as the Iberian lynx, black vulture and imperial eagle.The organisation is promoting rewilding projects across Europe, from Italy’s central Apennines to the Rhodope Mountains of Bulgaria and the Southern Carpathians in Romania.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/30/TELEMMGLPICT000230441100_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqIkUhv7k5mil0w0oeVCztIhVrDwi3LvLa62XQyE1Z5U4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"consider possibility coronavirus isnt actually anyones fault","story":"Our political culture fails to acknowledge that governments working with incomplete information will, inevitably, make mistakesWe know more about the coronavirus than we did two months ago. We have a clearer idea of how people get infected and of who is most at risk. It is starting to look, for example, as though outdoor transmissions are rare. It is also starting to look as though certain groups of people are unlikely to suffer severe symptoms. Women seem to be less susceptible than men, thin people than overweight people, young people than old people and so on. Had we known at the start of March what we know now, we would doubtless have done things differently.There would have been more emphasis on the shielding of hospitals and care homes, less on preventing casual outdoor meetings. There would, I suspect, also have been less pressure to close schools: each new study adds to the evidence that children are neither at risk themselves nor likely to infect others.Governments working with incomplete information will, inevitably, make mistakes. But our entire political culture is based around denying this obvious truth.Everything is seen through the prism of imagined culpability. Each day, at the briefing, broadcast journalists pass up the chance to ask interesting questions about the spread of the disease, possible mutations or levels of immunity. Instead they line up to accuse ministers of changing their tune, failing to foresee some development, or saying the wrong thing.Behind such questions is the implicit assumption that the number of fatalities is primarily determined by government policy. But how likely is this? Might not other factors, such as population density, demographics or climate, matter more?We don’t like to admit it, of course. All human beings place themselves at the centre of the universe and, by extension, we overestimate the impact of all human behaviour.How coronavirus affects young and oldOur remote ancestors could not believe that plagues simply happened. Something as awful as a pestilence had to be someone’s fault. Perhaps the population at large had committed a sin, or perhaps it was all the fault of a religious minority or some other unpopular group.We like to imagine that we have outgrown such superstitions, but have we? Is our determination to apportion blame any more rational than our reluctance to buy Corona beer?Our leaders are well aware of our anthropocentrism: they know that they, rather than climate or geography, will get whatever praise or blame is going. So, understandably, they overreact. Politically, it is better to squander billions than to be accused of inaction.The longer the lockdowns endure, the more they take on a momentum of their own.We might not have closed schools knowing what we now know. But that is not the same thing as being able to reopen them once the status quo has shifted.Commentators talk about “a new normal” after the lockdown, but the horrible truth is that we have already normalised the restrictions. See how easily we accepted the formulation of five tests for the closures to end, rather than five tests for the closures to continue.Seven weeks ago, I wrote that the restrictions would be easier to impose than to lift. Though there may not be much correlation between the strictness of a lockdown and the spread of the disease, many of us are now primed to blame ministers for every fatality. It is not just the virus that is keeping the country locked down. It’s us.When allegations of rule-breaking were first levelled against Vote Leave, they were given wall-to-wall coverage. The BBC and Sky News considered them an immense scandal. The Observer gave Carole Cadwalladr a whole page to air her conspiracy theories. Channel 4 News actually devoted an entire hour-long programme to them. The dropping of the last of the cases this week, by contrast, received little attention.Obviously, there are a lot of other things going on at the moment. Even so, had the police decided to press charges, I suspect those media would have found space for it.What happened was terrifying. Two honest citizens, Alan Halsall, a likeable entrepreneur from Lancashire, and Darren Grimes, a young man from a council estate in County Durham, had their lives turned upside down by false accusations. For four years – think about that, four years – they were pursued by the Electoral Commission. They had to spend more in legal fees than they would have been fined had they actually been guilty. They lost months of productive time.And all for what? No one was suggesting that they had rigged the vote, let alone made any personal gain. Both were volunteers. At worst, they had filled in a bit of paperwork incorrectly.No action, of course, will be taken against their accusers. Their case will stand as a warning to anyone else who challenges the Establishment: this is what we can do to you. If you were still wondering why we need to overhaul our quango state, here is your answer.Coronavirus latest news: Boris Johnson doubles down on stay alert slogan as Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland reject itNHS waiting lists could double by autumn, amid fears service will be overwhelmedFrance urges vigilance in easing lockdown after clusters detected in low-infection \u0026#39green\u0026#39 areasCurfew introduced as coronavirus stalks the Navajo nation Coronavirus timeline: From a few cases in China to a global pandemicSocial distancing: What are the rules and how might they change?Revealed: Boris Johnson\u0026#39s roadmap to ease lockdown and reopen schools and shopsEnd of lockdown timetable: When shops, offices, and public transport will reopen Boris Johnson\u0026#39s lockdown speech: what time is it, what will he say, and how can I watch it?US Mother\u0026#39s Day 2020: how the campaign was won – and why the woman behind it turned against her workWhen will the UK lockdown end?

After weeks of being confined to their homes and unable to work, study or simply enjoy themselves as normal, lockdowns are being lifted around the world.But while welcome, these moments are also fraught with danger, risking the potential of a second surge in coronavirus cases and more people succumbing to a disease which has already claimed more than 265,000 lives.Now, as Britain waits to hear from the Prime Minister how and when our lockdown will be lifted, all eyes are on those countries where social restrictions have been eased over the past few weeks.As infection rates have fallen schools have reopened in places like Denmark, shops allowed to trade in Austria and Germany and people have begun going back to work, even in Spain and Italy, two of the hardest hit countries.But it is not simply a case of returning to the kind of world we remember. Lifting lockdowns means retaining or adopting a complex set of social distancing measures to prevent an upsurge in infections, such as sitting apart from your classmates, face masks on public transport or distancing poles in museums.These measures will be closely monitored in Britain as it looks to those nations attempting the tightrope act of lifting the lockdown for pointers on how to end its own endurance test.Here The  looks at how restrictions are being eased as the virus recedes.Denmark became the first nation to ease restrictions when it reopened daycare centres, primary schools, small businesses and hairdressers on April 20th.More recently Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen announced that the spread of the virus had been brought under control, allowing the country to re-open by May 10.The decision to open primary schools meant a new set of rules for children: class sizes were cut by half and they have to wash their hands frequently, play in small groups and sit at desks at least two-metres apart.At the same time they are not allowed to bring toys from home and the school’s own toys and equipment has to be disinfected twice a day.Denmark’s R rate (the average number of infections caused by one infected person) did rise after easing the lockdown, but is still below the safe limit of 1.0 and there is as yet no sign of a second wave. Christian Wejse, of the department of infectious diseases at Aarhus University, said: “There are no signs whatsoever that the partial reopening has caused a bigger spread of infection. We are by no means home safe, but we have a really good starting point now to get the number of infected further down.”Austria was one of the first countries in Europe to ease restrictions when it allowed shops to reopen. More than three weeks on, there is still no sign of a second wave of infections according to the Austrian authorities.Restaurants and bars are to be allowed to reopen from the end of next week, along with religious services.As schools begin to go back this week classes are being ided in two to limit numbers, with one group taught from Monday to Wednesday, and a second on Thursday and Friday. The two groups will swap over each week.In Vienna, a socially distanced park has been built in the form of a maze. Each path is gated at entrance and exit and is 240cm away from other paths, allowing people to walk and exercise freely while being safely socially distanced.Germany took significant steps towards ending its lockdown this week, announcing that restaurants, pubs and hotels will be allowed to reopen.The Bundesliga football league is to resume from May 16, open air sport is once more permitted for the general public and Germans are allowed to entertain family and friends from up to two households.Classes are gradually resuming, with those facing exams given priority.Museums and zoos have already reopened, many with inventive new layouts to keep visitors apart. At the Brandenburg State Museum for Modern Art in Cottbus, southeast of Berlin, visitors in pairs can each take one end of a pole or ribbons exactly 1.5m long to keep their distance.The measures come with no sign of a second wave of infections more than two weeks after Germany began lifting its lockdown with the reopening of shops.With one of the highest death rates in the world - in part because of the way it counts fatalities - Belgium’s staggered reopening from this week is being closely watchedEmphasis is being placed on face masks. Shoppers are being advised to wear one and they are obligatory on public transport, where eating and drinking has been banned so people are not tempted to remove them.Masks are being sold from vending machines in train stations and anyone not wearing one faces a 250 euro fine. Local mayors have introduced rules demanding face masks are worn on certain streets which are too narrow or busy to ensure the 1.5 metre rule is respected. Masks are also mandatory if you are within 15 metres of a school at certain times. To meet demand, fabric shops have been given dispensation to open earlier than other shops, which must wait until May 11. Workers in Antwerp port have begun wearing smart wristbands that will tell them when they get too close to a colleague. Italy began easing its two-month lockdown on Monday, when the government allowed factories and construction sites to open up again after one of the strictest social distancing regimes in Europe.In a significant boost for morale people can go to the beach, but only to swim or run –not sunbathe. The same applies to parks, where Italians can walk or run but cannot stop for picnics.Shops are due to reopen on May 18, bars, restaurants and hairdressers on June 1, but schools will not open until September.In Alpine towns snow cannons have been used to spray disinfectant as a way of removing coronavirus from surfaces.From June 1, Phase Two of the reopening, train travellers must wear a mask and gloves, have a valid motive for travel and stay one metre from the other passengers. There is also disinfectant gel sanitizer available on the trains. These rules appear to be visibly posted in the larger urban train stations, but less so in the smaller cities. Buses are enforcing one way entry and exit rules, with face masks obligatory for passengers.In public places such as post offices and banks, every other chair in the waiting room has a sign saying don\u0027t sit here to keep people distanced. There are also taped lines on the floor suggesting people stand far back back from the counters.   After enduring a strict lockdown in which people were only recently allowed out for brief exercise almost all areas in Spain will enter the first of a three-phase exit plan on MondaySmall shops will be able to open and outdoor terrace bars can put out half the usual number of tables, though Madrid is offering to allow them to occupy more space where possible.Subway trains and buses in Spanish cities, including Madrid, have marked alternate seats as out of bounds to prevent people making contact with the person next to them, with standing room limited to two people per square metre.In phase two, indoor bars and restaurants will open with strict limits on numbers, as well as shopping centres, museums, cinemas and theatres, at one-third capacity.Hunting and fishing can resume in phase two, but bullfights are off limits until phase three, sometime in June, though promoters say it will not be worthwhile since each spectator must sit alone in a space of nine square metres.Also in phase three, beaches are due to reopen. Currently swimming and surfing are allowed, but not spending time on the sand. Portugal - which has had vastly lower infection and death rates than its neighbour after being quick off the mark to impose tough lockdown measures - is now into the first of a three-phase exit strategy, with small businesses having opened for customers on Monday, along with libraries, public offices and parks. Face masks are obligatory in covered public spaces, with gloves also encouraged. Phase two, from May 18, will see restaurants and cafés open at half capacity, as well as large stores, museums, galleries and monuments. Schools will reopen for pupils who have exams, with masks to be worn at all times. Crèches will also open for parents who need to use them.On June 1, all leisure options will be allowed to open, including gyms, hotels, malls, bars and nightclubs.A “good practices” guide for beachgoers is planned. Some beaches remain sealed off and out of bounds, while in other places people are being allowed to swim as an “inidual sport” now permitted along with fishing, golf and others.China - where Covid-19 first emerged - has been cautiously reopening its schools, with pupils across the country facing temperature checks at the gates and social distancing measures in the classroom.This week around 57,000 high school students with upcoming university entrance exams returned to class in Wuhan, the initial epicentre of the pandemic, where schools were closed in January.Arrival times were staggered and pupils wearing masks walked in single file to their desks, which were kept at least one metre apart.In Hangzhou, children at one elementary school have spent time decorating their own bespoke “social-distancing” hats which have metre-long wings to help them avoid getting too close to each other.Restaurants are also now open, although they are not as crowded as before the pandemic. Customers must have their temperature checked before entering and must have a green health code on an app which calculates their risk for Covid-19.On Friday China\u0027s top decision-making body gave the green light for cinemas, entertainment venues and sports facilities nationwide to shortly reopen after several months of closures.France will gradually start lifting restrictions on travel from May 11 as part of lockdown easing measures which rely on massive testing of suspected cases and their contacts.People will be able to travel up to 100km (62 miles) from home - up from just one kilometre currently - but only those with imperious family or professional reasons will be able to travel further.French borders will remain closed until 15 June at the earliest except for trans-border EU workers or European, including British, nationals with essential family or economic reasons, such as seasonal agriculture work.Masks will be compulsory in public transport on pain of a €135 fine. In Paris, only those with a form justifying professional or other essential reasons can travel during rush hour to avoid overcrowding.Some 100 million masks will be distributed to those who are sick, health staff and the vulnerable. Around a million pupils will return to classes next week in up to 85 percent of establishments, with priority given to health workers\u0027 children and those with special needs and difficulties.Secondary schools will remain shut in ‘red’ higher infection areas and only gradually opened elsewhere starting from May 18. Lycees. Lycees will remain shut nationwide until June at the earliest.Some 400,000 businesses will open but cafes, bars and restaurants will stay closed until at least June. Beaches will remain closed except if mayors and local officials agree otherwise. Dutch primary schools and childcare providers will reopen from May 11, with children allowed to play sports together as long as they remain 1.5 metres apart.Adults will also be allowed to to take part in sports as long as the game is outside and social distancing can be respected. But competitive matches are not allowed and neither is the use of shared changing rooms. Secondary schools will reopen from June 1. Vocational training schools will reopen for exams and practical training from June 15. People in contact based professions, such as driving instructors, alternative medicine practitioners and hairdressers can return to work but must stay 1.5 metres away from their clients.People on public transport are advised to use a face mask, which will become obligatory from June 1. Cafes and restaurants can reopen their outdoor seating provided the terrace is big enough to keep customers 1.5 metres apart and some establishments are trialling glass booths to keep diners safe.But cannabis cafes, sex clubs and brothels will stay closed until at least September 1 and will only reopen if coronavirus remains under control. New Zealand followed an \u0027eradication strategy\u0027 of shutting the country down early and keeping restrictions in place until it is sure community transmission has come to an end. The Level Four lock down announced when it hit 102 cases imposed significant restrictions on trade and movement and shut down schools and all domestic flights.People were instructed to stay at home in their “bubble” other than for essential personal movement.In less than two months the country is on a phased path to reopening, with May 4 marking its first day without any infection since it went into lockdown in March. It currently has two Covid-19 cases in hospital, none in ICU. They have lost 21 people to the virus.New Zealand has now moved to Level 3. This means people are still instructed to stay home in their bubble other than for essential personal movement, including to go to work, school if they have to, or for local recreation.Physical distancing of two metres outside home including on public transport, or one metre in controlled environments like schools and workplaces.People can reconnect with close family or bring in caregivers, or support isolated people as part of an extended bubble.Schools between years 1 to 10 and Early Childhood Education centres can open but will have limited capacity and children should learn at home if possible.People must work from home if possible. Businesses can open premises, but cannot physically interact with customers.Low-risk local recreation activities are allowed, but public venues are closed.New Zealand will move to the more relaxed Level 2 on Monday if “the disease is contained”, even if the risk of community transmission remains and “single or isolated cluster outbreaks” remain a possibility.In America, decisions about reopening are being taken by governors in each of the 50 states, creating a patchwork of differing rules across the country. Around half of the states are now partially reopening, mainly in the centre and south of the country. That includes ones run by both Republican and Democratic governors. States on the West coast, such as California and Washington which were hit early by coronavirus, and in the North East like New York and New Jersey still have lockdowns or restrictions in place.  Donald Trump has been the most prominent cheerleader for reopenings, repeatedly arguing that our country wasn\u0027t built to be shut down and warning of the economic consequences of prolonged lockdowns, while also urging safety.His administration published detailed guidance in mid-April that advised three phases for reopening which a state can progress through as the coronavirus outbreak fades away. However some states have ignored a key part of that advice - that they should only start loosening the rules once a downward trajectory of Covid-19 cases has been seen for 14 days. Many other states in the US are watching Georgia, which has forged ahead.It has already reopened for gyms, bowling alleys, cinemas, nail salons and massage therapists.Restaurants can open as long as there are only 10 diners per 500 square feet of floor space, and disposable menus are used.Shopping malls have reopened in some states including Georgia, Florida and Texas. They are limited to 25 per cent capacity and have seen few customers.South Korea is set to reopen schools next week for the first time in two months, starting with senior high school pupils preparing for university entrance exams. Schools will be required to carry out regular disinfection and temperature checks and to rearrange seating to help students keep their distance.South Korea has never been fully locked down. The resumption of education follows a steady easing of social distancing rules that has seen people return to shopping malls, golf courses and parks and employees swap work from home for office life again.But the slow return to normalcy has not been without risk. Alarm bells began ringing once again on Friday after it emerged that an infected 29-year-old man visited five night clubs and bars in the capital, Seoul. At least 14 more cases have now been linked to the same patient.The government has now requested bars and clubs to voluntarily suspend business for a month and to make sure that entry logs for visitors to public places are properly filled out for tracking purposes.Life in Israel has almost returned to normal, with prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu celebrating a self-declared victory over Covid-19.Hairdressers, hardware and electrical shops and restaurants have reopened, although the latter are takeaway-only. Mr Netanyahu has credited Israel\u0027s early decision to close its borders for its comparatively low mortality and infection rates compared to the rest of the Middle East. The country’s aviation chiefs are exploring the possibility of a medical passport system where citizens are allowed to travel abroad after undergoing a 45-minute coronavirus test. And Israeli scientists believe that analysing excrement in sewers will allow them to detect coronavirus hotspots and prevent a second wave.Additional reporting by Nick Squires, Justin Huggler, James Crisp, James Badcock, Nicola Smith, Giovanni Torre, Henry Samuel, James Rothwell, Marcus Parekh, Nick Allen and Lya CaiMore from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"end lockdown timetable when shops pubs transport offices reopen","story":"Boris Johnson is planning to address the nation again today at 7pm, when he will set out an exit plan for how Britain will gradually leave lockdown.While details of phase two of Britain\u0027s response to the coronavirus pandemic will only be made public at the end of this weekend, there are already some indications of how different elements of society are set to reopen.Guidance is expected to be issued by the Government on how shops can reopen safely, which would include physical distancing measures and could also extend to separate exits and entrances.All stores deemed non-essential were ordered to close when lockdown measures came into effect on March 23. These included clothing shops, bookstores, hairdressers, bed and breakfasts, and indoor and outdoor markets.Shops that have been exempt from the Government\u0027s ban are food retailers, pharmacies, hardware stores, corner shops, petrol stations, shops in hospitals, post offices, banks, newsagents, launderettes, and pet shops.Garden centres are to open this week, the Prime Minister is expected to announce. The centres will be allowed to open their doors on Wednesday while still abiding by social distancing rules.The hardware business B\u0026ampQ, which was deemed an essential retailer, last month reopened 75 of its stores after plans were agreed to safeguard customers and staff.The measures adopted by B\u0026ampQ offer some indication on the guidelines that will be issued across the sector, including strict limits of the numbers of customers in a store at any given time, designated queuing areas, and two-metre markers in order to remind customers of the need for social distancing.The British Retail Consortium has compiled a set of suggested rules which include having extra barriers, encouraging customers to shop alone, keeping changing rooms closed, and the use of protective screens at the tills.Brands are also considering introducing sanitation stations and even portable sinks, so  that people can wash their hands when they enter a store. Alex Baldock, the Dixons Carphone boss, has devised zero-contact stores, which will have drive-through-style pickup points for goods. The British Retail Consortium has submitted a report to Government recommending that if non-essential shops reopen, changing rooms should stay closed and in-store seating and services – such as advice, personal shopping or nail bars – should be limited.Retailers and unions have put aside long-standing differences to join forces, with the intention of restarting the retail sector as soon as possible without threats of industrial action.John Lewis, the department store chain, is due to open some of its stores from mid-May, while Associated British Foods - the boss of Primark’s owner - said notice of between two and four weeks will be required to help the industry get up and running again.Retailers that are currently trading have taken measures outside and inside stores, introducing plexiglass screens at tills and limiting numbers both in store and in socially-distanced warehousing operations.A glimpse of the new normal for working in offices is given by seven separate government documents obtained by this newspaper which give draft guidelines for opening shopping centres, hotels, factories, and offices.Recommendations for offices include plexiglass screens being installed between desks and the requirement for workers to sit back-to-back or side-to-side, rather than face-to-face. The Prime Minister is also set to announce that companies will be asked to provide face coverings for staff who are required back at work.The documents also stipulate that lifts should be half-empty, hot-desking is to be abolished for the foreseeable future, and the sharing of equipment such as pens and staplers will be banned.Employees will still be encouraged to work from home if this is possible, with employers expected to have regular communication with workers about their mental and physical wellbeing. In fact, Britons could be given a legal right to work from home to ensure that they are not forced to go back to workplaces after the lockdown under plans being considered in Whitehall.For those who do come into the workplace, the nine-to-five work day will end for the foreseeable future, as employers stagger arrival and departure times to reduce crowding.Office spaces are set to be reconfigured to enable adequate social distancing, with screens and floor markings used to ensure that staff stay two metres apart from one another.The document urges employers to continue to carry out meetings remotely where possible, as well as providing additional entry points, plus extra parking and bike-raking facilities to discourage the use of public transport.New rules as Italians have gone back to work have sparked confusion and frustration, which bosses will be keen to avoid as Britain gradually reopens for business.Public transport capacity and usage has been severely reduced throughout the lockdown. The London Underground has been operating a reduced service, with 40 Underground stations closing which do not sit on the intersections of Tube lines, and the Night Tube service was suspended on March 19 before the full lockdown came into place.“London will get through these extraordinarily challenging times and ensuring the capital’s critical workers can move around the city will be crucial,” said Mayor of London Sadiq Khan.Mr Johnson is expected to issue more guidance on face coverings after a survey by the rail and road watchdog, Transport Focus, found that more than half of commuters (51 per cent) would not be happy using trains and buses again unless the Government mandated the wearing of face masks.In a poll of 2,000 passengers, carried out earlier this month, 83 per cent of passengers said they also wanted hand sanitiser made available on vehicles as well as train stations and bus stops, and 62 per cent said they would not venture back onto public transport unless effective social-distancing measures are in place.The Transport Secretary Grant Shapps on May 9 announced a £2 billion package to increase cycling and walking capacity across the United Kingdom, a response to the new difficulties that commuters will face getting to work during the pandemic.The programme will be published early next month and aims to double the amount of people cycling by 2025, while also encouraging more people walking to work.Measures announced include pop-up bike lines, wider pavements, and streets that will exclusively be for the use of bicycles and buses.“Whilst it’s crucial that we stay at home, when the country does get back to work we need to ask those people to carry on cycling or walking and for them to be joined by many others as well,” Mr Shapps said.Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said that masks are currently being stockpiled for use by the public, and that face coverings on public transport could be encouraged in order to reassure the public that it is safe to go back to work. Masks and distancing measures are two of the measures that could be made compulsory on public transport.British Transport Police may need to maintain a presence at station entrances to ensure crowd control and social distancing at the busiest times, while companies are likely to have to stagger their working days to avoid a single rush hour.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has suggested that the use of public transport during peak time should be discouraged, in order to reduce congestion and lessen the risk of infection spreading.Examples would be to increase the relative price of commuting at peak times on the London tube and bus network, or to suspend the London congestion charge for drivers, it said.As things stand, pubs and restaurants - with the exception of restaurants which are currently operating solely in a takeaway capacity - will be among the last spaces to reopen.It is not currently possible when this will be, but industry estimates range from July through to winter or even early 2021.Restrictive measures on reopening are likely to include fewer tables, limits on customer numbers, shortened opening hours, more local produce, and restricted menus.Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), said: Currently there is no clear indication as to when pubs will be able to open again. As it stands, the Government guidance is clear and pubs will continue to adhere to that.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2020/04/09/TELEMMGLPICT000229335354_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"public health bureaucrats must face reckoning catastrophic coronavirus","story":"In the UK, there was no discussion about testing and tracing – the key failure of PHE that allowed the virus to spread unbeknownstThe responses of different governments to coronavirus have been largely characteristic. China censored whistle-blowers and allowed the virus to spread across the globe before soldering apartment doors shut. Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and Hong Kong introduced border measures and tested, traced, and isolated. They avoided mass outbreaks. President Trump shut the border to China but did little else. Australia also shut its border, but went further with testing.Britain’s Sir Humphries are supposed to be well-educated and competent. This crisis, however, has proven otherwise. The bureaucracy failed to prevent an infectious disease outbreak and tens of thousands have died. The “best and brightest” bungled the biggest threat since the Second World War.This was not for a lack of resources. We spend billions on public health – but infectious diseases get half as much money as obesity. It was not a failure of imagination, either. A pandemic has been the UK’s number one official threat for years. Nor was there a lack of planning. On paper, the UK ranked among the top countries in the world for pandemic preparedness.So what went wrong?The Cygnus Exercise report leaked last week is revealing. Cygnus was a three-day simulated influenza pandemic led by Public Health England (PHE) in 2016. It involved hundreds of people across local authorities, departments and the NHS.What is most insightful about the exercise’s findings is not what it discovered but the omissions. These supposed top public health officials had almost no foresight about the challenges we would face in 2020.There was no discussion about testing and tracing – the key failure of PHE that allowed the virus to spread unbeknownst. This slowed our response and likely cost lives. PPE was mentioned just once, in a discussion about distribution points, not huge supply chain issues. Border measures to prevent a virus entering the country were not considered.Impact of behavioural and social interventionsThe generals were fighting the last war: an influenza outbreak like the H1N1 virus of 2009, rather than a novel coronavirus like Covid-19. This is despite relatively recent outbreaks of coronaviruses including Sars and Mers. So although enough antiviral cold and flu tablets for half the population were stockpiled, they have proven useless.Operation Cygnus did show some foresight, but the operation’s stark warnings about the ability of the care sector to deal with a pandemic were never passed on. So when Covid-19 hit, the NHS activated its pandemic rapid discharge protocols in March like clockwork, discharging thousands out of hospitals into care homes. Few were tested, bringing the virus into contact with the most vulnerable.We cannot make the same mistakes again. Parts of the media have blandly focused on personalities: who was at what meeting?

No problem, just download the program.“Grimes explains how to pronounce baby name X Æ A-12Elon Musk explains why he’s selling all his possessionsElon Musk says video calls will ‘definitely’ be coming to Tesla carsAsked how long it would take for his firm to develop technology advanced enough to do it, Musk said between five and 10 years, “if the development continues to accelerate”.Musks extraordinary prediction came at the end of an eventful couple of weeks for the technology entrepreneur.Earlier this week, his pop star girlfriend Grimes gave birth to their first child, before leaving many fans confused over the boy’s name.It came just days after a tweet from Musk about Tesla’s share price saw the company value temporarily plummet $14bn (£11.2bn).“Tesla stock price too high imo,” Musk said, kicking off a bizarre series of tweets in which he claimed he was planning to sell “almost all” of his physical possessions.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Together they are expected to help contribute towards observations from telescopes like Hubble and data from the Juno spacecraft to better understand our still mysterious, huge neighbour.NASA images of Jupiter turned into beautiful abstract artworksThe Gemini data were critical because they allowed us to probe deeply into Jupiter\u0027s clouds on a regular schedule, said Michael Wong of UC Berkeley.The scientists used a technique called lucky imaging, Wong said, which sees scientists take a vast number of very short exposure images, but filters them so that only the sharpest images taken when Earth\u0027s atmosphere is stable are used. That allowed the scientists to create images that rival the view from space, Wong said.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There has since been no update on this guidance.Immigration lawyers accused the department of leaving people in a “stressful and precarious” situation by maintaining that the visa extensions would only last\u0026nbspuntil the end of this month, and called on ministers to urgently\u0026nbspextend the date to September.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesVisa holders who did not qualify for the extension but whose visas are due to expire soon after 31 May are also worried because lockdown has meant they are unable to apply to extend their leave due to the closure of English\u0026nbsplanguage test centres and the inability to make\u0026nbspapplications that need to be submitted from outside\u0026nbspthe UK.Ben Hicks, 36, said his family had been left in limbo because they have been unable to get clarity on\u0026nbspwhether his Chinese wife, Tingting Zhang, 36, who flew from\u0026nbspWuhan on an evacuation flight in February to be with him\u0026nbspand their five-year-old daughter Sufei, would be able to stay in Britain.Ms Zhang, who was granted a six-month visa\u0026nbspon arriving in the UK, had been planning to submit a spouse application before the pandemic started so that she could live with her husband and daughter permanently, but because it is an out-of-country\u0026nbspapplication ⁠–\u0026nbspmeaning it has to be submitted from outside the UK ⁠–\u0026nbspshe is now not able to do so.The Home Office has said that people whose visas expire before the end of May can apply for out-of-country visas\u0026nbspfrom inside Britain, but Ms Zhang’s\u0026nbspvisit visa ends in August so she does not qualify.Mr Hicks, who met his wife 12 years ago while they were both working on a cruise ship, said he was being “sent round in circles” when he tried to phone the Home Office to clarify what they should do, and that the situation was putting the family’s life on hold for even longer.Home Office criticised over ‘lack of clarity’ on NHS visa extensionsMigrants told to rely on ‘investments and savings’ during lockdownHome Office urged to grant NHS visa extensions to care workers The couple already faced a setback in starting a life together when the Home Office refused Ms Zhang’s fiancee visa in 2014 on the basis that Mr Hicks was not working in the UK, due to working on a cruise ship. Since then, they have spent long periods apart while he has looked for a new job\u0026nbspin order to meet the minimum income requirement for a spouse visa.“I’ve been working hard for nine months to get this sorted. We just want to get on with it so we can finally start a life together as a family. If it wasn’t for the pandemic we would have applied by now and she would probably be here long-term. But at this point, unless the Home Office revises the guidance, she will have to leave again\u0026nbspin August,” he said.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They’ve had to say something because it would look bad if they said nothing, but that’s as far as this has gone.”Families are also concerned because\u0026nbspmany\u0026nbspvisas, including spouse visas, require a valid English language test in order to make an application, and currently test centres are set to be closed until at least June.Immigration lawyer Harjap Bhangal said: “Many people have had deadlines which have passed or are approaching in the immediate future. The Home Office has failed to provide a concession or any sort of clear guidance for people in this situation.“If they apply without a test they run the risk of refusal or even having their route changed from five years to 10 years. If refused, they potentially face a financial loss of around £2,000 to £3,000, the risk of becoming overstayers and hence ‘illegal’ and will no doubt lose their jobs and possibly also face removal action and hence be potentially split up from their families.”Mr Bhangal warned that a Windrush-style issue could emerge, adding: “The Home Office tends to wait for a problem or scandal to occur and then try to solve it as opposed to try and prevent foreseeable problems in the first place.“We have seen this with the recent Windrush scandal, which could have been prevented if the Home Office had been proactive and more willing to just talk to the victims before issuing removal and deportation notices. We could potentially face a similar situation here where people begin to get refused or become fearful to apply due to the Home Office’s failure to foresee this problem.”Sonia\u0026nbspLenegan, legal director at the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association (ILPA), said: “In just over three weeks the current extension of leave is due to end. The Home Office cannot realistically expect all of those people to get on a plane between now and then.“It is not right to leave people in such a stressful and precarious position. Another, lengthy, extension must be confirmed as a matter of urgency. In March,\u0026nbspILPA\u0026nbsprecommended an extension until September, and that remains our position.”A Home Office spokesperson said:\u0026nbsp“We have extended visas to 31 May 2020 for all foreign nationals who are lawfully in the UK and unable to return home and expanded in-country switching provisions.“This is being kept under regular review, but no one will be penalised for circumstances outside of their control.”UK Visas and Immigration\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The need to maintain social distancing means that our public transport system cannot go back to where it left off.Created with Sketch.How coronavirus lockdowns changed the world\u0027s most polluted cities Show all 6Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.“Here is a very stark fact: even with public transport reverting to a full service, once you take into account the two-metre social distancing rule, there will only be effective capacity for one in 10\u0026nbsppassengers in many parts of the network. Just a tenth of the old capacity.”Speaking at the No 10 daily press conference, he also said £2bn of a £5bn fund announced earlier this year\u0026nbspwill be used to “put cycling and walking at the heart of our transport policy”, with a national cycling plan to be published in early June.Of this money, £250m\u0026nbspwill be used for “swift, emergency” measures to make cycling and walking safer, with pop-up bike lanes, wider pavements and cycle and bus-only streets created in England.Mr Shapps, however, said the changes represented a “health opportunity”, adding that millions of people had taken up cycling and walking during the lockdown, with some areas experiencing a 70 per cent rise in the number of people on bikes for exercise or travel.“For employees who want to start to cycle to work\u0026nbspbut don’t have a bike right now, the popular cycle-to-work scheme already allows workers to save between 25 and 39 per cent on the cost of a new bike, or indeed electric bike,” he added.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

E-scooter trials will also be fast-tracked by ministers – from next year to next month.Mr Shapps said: “This £2bn announcement represents the most significant package of cycling, walking and green travel by any British government.”The announcement comes as campaigners called for a fundamental redesign of the transport system to help prevent a bounce-back in air pollution once the lockdown is eventually lifted by the government.In a letter to Mr Shapps and the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, nine organisations, including Greenpeace UK and Transport Action Network, said it would be “completely absurd\u0026nbspif, after the unprecedented efforts and sacrifices made to save thousands of lives from Covid-19, we allowed thousands more to be cut short by the devastating impacts of toxic pollution”.A YouGov poll commissioned by Greenpeace also found that 71 per cent of the public were concerned about the possibility of air pollution returning to pre-lockdown levels once the stringent restrictions are lifted.The survey also suggested\u0026nbsp58 per cent backed the introduction of cycle lanes on urban main roads, along with increased government funding for walking and cycling infrastructure.Department for Transport\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It’s far too early to put a date on it.“Schools will be out for a little longer yet but they’re definitely a top priority.”But the Government is facing resistance from unions who insist they will not consider auntil a “test and trace” scheme for Covid- is in place for schools.No date has been confirmed for schools to reopen as Education Secretary Gavin Williamson previously refused to provide clarity on the matter.But he did say that he is considering kids of all ages ing on a rota basis so they can catch up on classes they missed out on during Covid- lockdown.Headteachers said in April that schools should not reopen before June .Schools have been closed since March  - three days before Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown.A source said: Ministers are determined to give every child the chance to get back into the classroom in some form before schools break up for summer.Mr Williamson said he is giving a lot of consideration to reopening schools in stages and has requested assistance from the nations top scientic group, Sage, to plot how to get children back to school safely.He told MPs: When we bring schools back - and I think everyone wants to see schools ing - they will be ed in a phased manner. He told the Education Select Committee that the date that schools reopen could depend on the advice he gets from Sage, but stressed that schools would get as much notice as possible.All schools ing on day one with a full complement of pupils will not be realistic, he told MPs.He made it clear that children and teachers would not be working through their six week summer holiday.Teachers are due holidays and many have carried on working for vulnerable and key worker children or preparing home-school lessons.Schools for younger children are expected tosooner than those in secondary school due to them needing their parents to remain at home to look after them.The Government is concerned that the continued lockdown will have huge economic implications.As a result, officials are eager for adults toto work as soon as possible.However, -year-olds moving from primary school could be a priority in the phased .Little ones in reception and early years could be the last toin this potentially phased re-opening.GCSE and A-level students could be heading back to classrooms sooner than other years.There is still no currentdate, but Mr Williamson stressed he will give schools as much notice as possible.Teachers are conducting distance learning with pupils and a lot of online tutoring companies have been offering free assistance.Exams have been cancelled, leaving hard-working teenagers in a dficult, stressful and frustrating place around their futures.The exam regulator, Ofqual, and exam boards will work with teachers to provide grades to students whose exams have been cancelled this summer. Exam boards will not be issuing any papers or tests at all.The government is using a mix of student performance criteria that include teacher assessments, mock exam grades and overviews of a pupils general work.According to the government website, all students who were due to sit an A level, AS level or GCSE exams this summer will receive a calculated grade based on mock exams results and non-exam assessments.The Department for Education has stressed that students will not be issued predicted grades as this would not be fair.The calculated grades will be formal grades, however, and will be given the same status as grades awarded in any other year, so will be accepted by colleges and universities.For more information visit the government website here.The government guidelines say: The calculated grades awarded will be formal grades, with the same status as grades awarded in any other year.University representatives expect universities to be flexible and do all they can to support students and ensure they can progress to higher education.There is a lot of worry over how that will play out in practice, particularly for underprivileged students or kids who just didnt take the mock exams as seriously as the real deal.If a student does not believe the correct process has been followed in their case they will be able to appeal on that basis.In addition,they do not feel their calculated grade reflects their performance, they will have the opportunity to sit an exam, as soon as is reasonably possible after schools and colleges open again.Students will also have the option to sit their exams in summer .Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more.There are plenty of online learning s for homeschooled children, with YouTube videos being popular.The BBC has also released Bitesize Daily.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am , so when I joined the workforce we were in the midst of a financial crisis that plunged the economy into paralysis.I have endured years of political to-ing and fro-ing over spending, infrastructure projects and — whether you voted for it or not — Westminster’s tortuous Brexit chicanery that has slowed down economic growth.The price  Real wages, measured alongside inflation, only got back above their  levels this year.House prices shot up to unaffordable levels, with governments promising to build the houses we need but failing miserably to take on the vested interests that stand in the way.Young people could already only dream of owning a home before the world shut down.Just this week, a friend sent round a story on WhatsApp about the possibility of house prices collapsing.We all just laughed and agreed we still could not get anywhere near a deposit, and not because we have been enjoying too much avocado toast.And just as we looked forward to a British bounce once Brexit was in the rear-view mirror, now a global pandemic has made  look like nothing more than a trailer for the main event in which this young generation, yet again, gets a starring role.It is not just about getting money moving and business booming, either.The temporary schemes introduced by the Government to get people through the worst of this crisis will leave a borrowing pile that not even Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell could have dreamed up.Most likely, that means higher taxes and lower spending for decades. In short, Britain’s under-s are being condemned to years of an economy going backwards.So it is time for them to be allowed back to work and start the recovery.

But a fellow young soldier was running to catch up, so they pulled him in and he sat opposite my grandpa, who askedhe was OK.He replied “yes”, only for his stomach and guts to fall out all over the floor. He was dead within minutes.Because my grandpa was a professional soldier, he wasn’t demobilised and sent home after the war, but was billeted with the family of a German soldier of equal rank as he became part of the occupation forces in the British-run sector of what would become West Germany.Just imagine how hard that must have been: Living with someone who a few weeks earlier you were trying to kill.But my grandpa said: “They were just like us, fighting for their country.”Without wanting to disparage the generations that have followed — mine included — it’s hard to imagine a member of Generation X or a millennial turning such trauma into a positive way of living.But,  years on, there’s very good reason why our leaders today have regularly invoked the unsurpassed generation who came of age during World War Two throughout the current coronavirus crisis.It’s no coincidence this group of fine folk includes the Queen, Sir David Attenborough and Captain Tom Moore, who have all provided the nation with so much inspiration at a time when celebrities, experts and politicians have often looked so deeply inadequate.That gives me some hope that out of our current trauma will come a new great generation of young leaders to shepherd us through the next  years.Maybe I’m naive, but I think the current pain and uncertainty surrounding lockdown could strengthen the character of young people, who have been mollycoddled by teachers and parents for so long.This is the only time since the last world war where the entire globe is engaged in a conflict that has upended le as we know it.We are again surrounded by tragedy, uncertainty and genuine fear.Adults can no longer provide easy assurances or answers to children about when they will be able toto normal le, be it visiting grandparents, going on holiday, shopping for clothes or attending school.While this is a situation no one would ever have wished for, I have a growing optimism that we are never going to take any of those seemingly everyday pursuits for granted again.What’s so striking about the generation who lived through World War Two is their total rejection of unnecessary consumerism. The Queen is a great example of this.She has all the money and privilege in the world, but feels no need to replace her rotary-dial telephone from  at Windsor Castle or wallpaper that dates back to Queen Victoria at Balmoral.I guess anyone who worried about surviving the London Blitz or lived in terror over whether relatives and friends wouldfrom the front line understands that hyper- consumerism is largely unimportant.Grandpa Bill’s future we, Catherine Taylor, my beloved grandma, was  years old and living in South Shields, Tyne and Wear, when World War Two broke out.My great-grandfather, a World War One veteran and coal miner, had resolved to send her to Canada on the SS Athenia.Thank God he changed his mind at the last minute it was the first British ship lost after war was declared.She was instead evacuated to Cockermouth in the Lake District to live with another family, but ed home just as German bombers started targeting the Tyneside shipyards and suburbs of Newcastle.My proud Geordie grandma Rua, as I called her, spent night after night in a not-at-all-sturdy brick shelter in their back garden, listening to the bombs drop nearby, on one occasion on her actual street.It was no le for a teenager. She carried her gas mask everywhere, knitted for airmen, joined bucket lines to put out fires and grieved for the  people of Newcastle lost in the bombings.Then there was the daily fear of the “telegram boy” arriving with messages of relatives killed in combat.But determined to help the war effort further, she dropped out of school and in  joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service — the women’s branch of the British Army during the war.This week I listened back to an oral history I recorded with my late grandma in the Nineties where she recounted her experiences of the time in her typically stoic and understated manner.I noticed that any time I tried to guide her towards talking about the emotional cost of her teenage years being overtaken by tragedy, she batted it away.“We didn’t talk much about nasty things,” she said softly. “I hated the bombing and I was terried. Looking back, I think we got through it with lots of prayers.“The war taught you about tragedy in people’s lives but you just battled on regardless.”In fact, grandma said the positives included being “united as a nation” and “people caring for one another”.Was she ever depressed “Le was entirely dferent then. We did sort of lose our teenage years in a way because they weren’t happy go lucky.“Teenagers in England now have the chance to go on the Continent and travel around at a very small cost.We couldn’t do anything like that. You just carried on. You had to.”There is very little comparison to what we are going through at the moment with the six years of death and destruction in World War Two.But it’s impossible to deny that the travel, socialising and happy-go- lucky approach to le we had become accustomed to has been stolen from us, for now at least.Youngsters previously so obsessed with how many people watched their latest dance video on TikTok are starting to think twice about what really matters.They’re volunteering. They’re cooking for family members. They’re talking on Zoom to isolated elderly relatives.Millennials who had become turned off and disillusioned with public le during the partisan Brexit wars are starting to re-engage with politics, aware of the real-le impact of decisions made by our leaders.Ridiculous snowflake battles around identity politics and social issues now feel meaningless.I hope and pray that when we look back in many decades’ time, we will be talking about how the historic coronavirus pandemic of  helped create a new greatest generation in the same way the end of World War Two did  years earlier.But tomorrow my thoughts will be entirely with all four of my grandparents — Bill, Cath, RAF airman John George Wheeler and London Blitz survivor Sylvia Jean Cook — who put their coming of age aside for the good of the country.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was no implication that the wicked Tories were plotting to murder us all in our beds. There was no attempt to score cheap party-political points against a PM who is freshly back from death’s door.Yet Starmer’s concern was real. And it is a concern we all share.Why DO we have the worst death toll in Europe There will be time enough for a full-scale inquiry after we have won this war. But we would not be humanwe did not ask the question now ­— is the UK really the sick man of Europe  Are we truly doing so much worse than every other country Much is made of our death toll exceeding that of Italy.It sometimes feels aswe are locked in some grotesque Champions League of human misery.Yet the statistics can be misleading. Spain, for example, does not count deaths in care homes — we do. Germany only counts care home fatalities when Covid- has been diagnosed before death. And China — officially with fewer than , deaths — lies through its teeth, and has lied from the very start.There are factors that no British Government could do anything about. According to Wednesday’s data from the Office for National Statistics, ,, of us are jammed into this overpopulated little island ­— six million more than Italy.The UK is a crowded country and our capital is a global city — the perfect petri dish for a global pandemic.Thirteen million Brits are clinically obese and this virus is particularly murderous among the overweight. There are .million Brits over the age of  and the virus is pitiless among the elderly.Yet it is painfully obvious that massive cock-ups have been made.Because our politicians are always terried of looking racist, British airports were left open for far too long. Around million people were let into the UK between January  and March , even as the virus rampaged across the world.Yet just  travellers arriving from Wuhan were made to self-isolate.We have relied on the likes of China and Turkey to make kit for our health carers, when so much of what they produce is shoddy trash that can’t even be used, including the , gowns from Turkey currently impounded at a Heathrow warehouse after inspectors found the gear was “useless”.London’s Labour Mayor Sadiq Khan cut Tube trains, ensuring NHS staff travelled to work on dangerously packed carriages.So don’t just blame the Tories.Testing has been — still is — pathetically slow, choked by paperwork.But perhaps the biggest mistake of all is that this Government has been far too eager to defer to the “experts” — even when those very same “experts” have got it spectacularly wrong in the past.Professor Neil Ferguson, the key scientic adviser who was the brains behind this national lockdown, was caught this week taking his daily exercise by mounting his married mistress, thereby breaking the strict rules he designed for the rest of us. The bonking boffin’s rank hypocrisy is bad enough.But what should worry us more is Ferguson’s defective crystal ball. Was it made in China  Neil Ferguson’s team produced the we-are-all-doomed research that predicted more than , would die without nationwide house arrest.Yet Professor McPantsdown’s previous predictions are so inaccurate they make Paul The Octopus look like Nostradamus.The preachy prof told us in  that , of us could die from mad cow disease.

Mistakes have certainly been made — just as they were made in the war that we have remembered over the past few days.But the British people have reacted to this historic challenge with patience, resilience and quiet courage.

Even a slowly phasedto normal gets little support, with just four per cent in favour of a gradual lting of the lockdown starting this week.The results of our poll will be studied closely in  Downing Street as officials put the finishing touches to their blueprint for a slow and safe end to the lockdown today. Ex-Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith believes the health warnings have been too stark and the stay-at-home payments too generous.And he warned Mr Johnson it will be a massive undertaking to convince the nation it is safe to venture outside again.Mr Duncan Smith said: “The government’s rhetoric on the dangers of the virus has been so frightening nearly everyone has bought into it.“Strangely, the general public has grasped the idea that the economy is in deep trouble but many are happy to accept the huge furlough payments they are receiving to stay at home and do nothing.“They’ve been feather-bedded by the Chancellor and it seems to have generated a feeling that it can go on for ever and it’s risk-free.“The government has to change its message fast to win the same volume of support for ending the lockdown as it has for imposing it.”Our poll reveals public approval of the way the PM has handled the crisis — with  per cent saying he is doing a good job of leading Britain through the pandemic.But there are concerns about infection rates in care homes and lack of personal protective equipment for NHS staff.Six out of ten people believe the PM’s personal experience of Covid- makes him better placed to deal with the crisis.And two-thirds think it will make him more cautious about lting the restrictions too quickly.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab gets a positive response for his performance as stand-in leader, as do Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Chancellor Rishi Sunak.The poll also confirms the pandemic will make us more fearful. One in four are unlikely to take a holiday this year because of the risk of travelling.Deltapoll director Martin Boon said: “So far, Britain’s workers are happy to stay locked up so long as money keeps flowing their way, even though many fear for the country’s economic future.“There is a real fear that the economy is going down the tubes but the public still puts handling of the virus and lives lost ahead of economic consequences.“Whatever happens, for now the government smells of roses. The Chinese are getting the blame for the virus, while only  per cent point a finger at the British government for moving too slowly, many of whom just happen to have voted Labour at the last election.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He gets in his car and tries to document that.The lawyer told reporters his client drove behind the McMichaels car because he didnt recognize Arbery after a supposed increase in burglaries in the locality but he knew their vehicle.Glynn County Police Detective Lt. Cheri Bashlor said there were no reported break ins for seven weeks leading up to the shooting, however. Bryan maintains he handed over the footage to cops on the scene, he has since lost his job, and his family have been threatened.So far, two district attorneys - including Barnhill - have been recused from from the case due to conflicts.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And in those four minutes she summed up the sacrice of the generation who fought the Second World War, she spoke of the pain of our own time and she explained what it all meant.I will never forget her speech.Because the Queen understands this country, and she understands our people, like nobody  ever will again.Her Majesty does not merely lt our spirits — she defines them.This is her second address to the nation in little over a month.“We will meet again,” she said in her April broadcast on coronavirus, and million people knew that things would get better, evenwe don’t know where, and don’t know when.Aged , after  years on the throne, she embodies the living history of our country like nobody has before and nobody ever will again.When she speaks of the war that still defines this country, she does so with a unique authority.She was there in , standing on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her family and Winston Churchill, a -year-old proudly wearing her khaki Auxiliary Territorial Service unorm, soon to slip off into the euphoric crowds with her kid sister.Like my parents, the Queen lost her teenage years to the war — a child when the conflict began, she was a woman when it ended, celebrating her th birthday in , when the conflict was still raging.For her VE Day speech she wore the two diamond brooches her father gave her to mark that birthday.The Queen is a veteran of that terrible conflict too.It was not simply what she said. The Queen does a video backdrop better than any Zoom-savvy teenager.As she spoke for those unforgettable four minutes, your eyes drted to the photograph of her father, King George VIand her service cap and a picture of her family on the balcony on Buckingham Palace on VE Day.We talk a lot in this country about that generation, and have wondered oftenwe could do what they did.It is the Queen who has told us, more than once, that we are still the same people who freed the world  years ago.And you thought of the selfless NHS workers — and also the drivers of bus and Tube, the care home workers, the delivery guys, the bin men, the supermarket workers, all those unsung heroes who risk their lives so that others are safe — and her words rang so true that it broke your heart.“They risked all so our families and neighbourhoods could be safe,” said the Queen of the greatest generation. “We should and will remember them.”I have been privileged to know many veterans of the Second World War. They are all gone now.But yesterday their spirits were with me again because of the Queen’s speech.I felt their presence, I understood their sacrice and I was grateful once more for all the freedoms they bought with their blood.Those of us who were lucky enough to be born after the war come to take our freedoms for granted. The generation who we saluted on Friday know better.“At the start the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain,” the Queen said. “But we kept faith.”The Queen was speaking of the war but her words resonated through our own struggle fighting an enemy we can’t see.“Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish,” she said.“Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps. But the streets are not empty. They are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other.”This -year-old Queen is grandmother to the nation now.In her we glimpse mothers and nans and great-grandmothers long gone, and in her we see the wisdom and the love and the grit of our people.“Never give up, never despair — that was the message of VE Day.”Plain words, spoken from the heart, and inspirational.Because she understands that behind those jubilant VE Day crowds were families that had been shattered, mourning wives and sweethearts and mothers and orphaned children, and an army of angels in khaki and light and dark blue who never came home.And she acknowledged that on VE Day men were still men fighting and dying on the other side of the world.This Queen misses nothing. Indeed, she gets it so right that it takes your breath away.“When I look at our nation today,” she said, “and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire.”When the nation’s grandmother tells you that the greatest generation would be proud of us, she convinces in a way that no politician — nor indeed any other member of the Royal Family — ever could.We are so very lucky to have her.But, my God — what will we ever do without her To follow us on Facebook, simply Like our Coronavirus page.Get Britains best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day - find out more. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s one of the best things I’ve ever done.“I see extraordinary kindness every day, from the staff helping people to those wanting to give something back to them.”Andrew began volunteering for the hospital last month after being furloughed from his job as a chef at the Stop the World café in Leigh.He says: “The hospital had put an ad out for volunteers. I applied straight away. I wasn’t scared at all about working in a hospital during the crisis. I was just keen to help.”As well as manning the “kindness table” Andrew has also been driving to collect donations. Hardworking NHS staff are able to choose items, like cakes and chocolate, during their much-needed breaks.He says: “It’s the small things that brighten up their day and I’m glad I’m able to be part of this.”This is not Andrew’s first time volunteering.

And the gin was very enjoyable too!Fay HowardI DON’T know how we’d manage without my daughter SHARON FOTHERGILL, my son CHRISTOPHER TANDY and granddaughter AMY TRICKETT for keeping us supplied with our shopping and cooked meals. And our great pals NEIL AND MOLLY FOX for keeping us supplied with reading material and chocolate!David Tandy, , and we Barbara, , of WakefieldI’D like to say thanks to LEEDS IRISH CENTRE. It should have been enjoying massive celebrations for its th anniversary this summer, with a book out and a number of events and parties. Instead, twice a week, the staff make over  sandwiches which are then shared via the city charity, Simon On The Streets, to local homeless people. The centre has a long record for helping those in need and continues its kindness during this crisis. They are unsung heroes.Julie Moore, LeedsTHANKS to EMMA ETHERINGTON, a registered general nurse who has had extra training to work in ICU.

She is  per cent in the right job!Paige Louise BakerAbigail Oleck-Hewett, , whose clients include Lady Gaga and Holly Willoughby, had to close her skin business BeauSkin London and tanning firm Beaubronz when the lockdown hit.So she signed up to five volunteer organisations and donated all the PPE from her salons to hospitals.Abi, of Dorking, Surrey, says: “There is no way I was going to sit at home and do nothing – I want to help my community. It’s a full-time job. I’m so busy that I need a diary to schedule it all in.“But I realised early on there was an urgent need to support the most vulnerable. My mum Vivienne is  and my grandmother Margaret is  and they live on the same street – and I was taking deliveries from Surrey to Kent to them.“I knew there were thousands of others out there who also need support and help. With my training in infection-control, I was confident I could not only deliver what they need, but also do it with the minimum risk to them.”Abi, who is also a guest presenter on QVC and Ideal World, adds: “It may be dferent from my day job, but it is no less rewarding.“What really brought home the seriousness is that we do a weekly delivery of  food bags in a tiny village of just , people.“I was shocked so many people were self-isolating or shielding – but this is the effect of Covid-.”I’D like to thank my daughter SAMANTHA ELLIS. She’s helping on the call centre for Covid-, helping and directing people for testing. She works for Hays Travel and was put on furlough.

Last week they delivered , bags of donated food.Clare said: “We set up a community fridge to make unwanted food available for anyone that would like it, at no cost. When we opened, we literally had one fridge.“Since Covid-, demand has gone through the roof. My volunteers have been working -hour days, seven days a week.“We had to close the community fridges for safety reasons but quickly adapted to become a delivery service. At Christmas we had  volunteers. It’s now . A lot of these people have been furloughed, laid off or work part-time and want to do help. Every one of them is incredible.“Before Covid, we were processing kg of donated food a week. Last week it was ,kg. It’s the double low-income families and those on zero-hour contracts who need most help.”Clare fears the next six months will be even tougher for people as the full financial sting is felt.She added: “We’re just at the beginning of this. People from all walks of le will need our help.”PHOTOGRAPHER GILES DULEY is a triple amputee after stepping on an IED while working in Afghanistan.

It is unlikely they watched the movie alone and without a massage.Literary agent John Brockman has previously claimed he witnessed the Duke of York receiving a foot massage from two Russian women at Epsteins mansion.Epstein, who killed himself in August while awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors, had only months before the  visit completed a -month stint in jail following a conviction for procuring an underage girl for prostitution.Andrew has always maintained he made the trip only to cut ties with Epstein.The prince has previously been accused of having sex with Epstein victim Virginia Roberts when she was , though has always denied wrongdoing.Discussing the  visit in a widely-criticised BBC interview in November, Andrew said: Now, I went there with the sole purpose of saying to him that because he had been convicted, it was inappropriate for us to be seen together.But the account given by the anonymous insider contradicts that claim.I think that it was Epstein who invited Andrew to NYC, the source said.The girls were going to Epstein’s house specically to meet Andrew, not just Epstein.The source identies one of the three women as model Lana Zakocela, who had worked for Victoria Secret, which is owned by Epsteins financial client, Les Wexner.The source also told the Mail on Sunday that Epstein used the prince to improve his image following his release from jail.I think Andrew was incredibly useful for him as a promotion tool, she said.He had just left jail, and to show a guest of such a level was perfect for his social capital.He was telling everyone that the prince was in the city.Epstein also reportedly spoke about watching  Oscar winner The Kings Speech, whose central character is George VI, Andrews grandfather, with Andrew prior its release in the UK.The insider says that Andrew might have received a foot massage from a woman during the screening.Representatives of Prince Andrew have been approached for comment.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

continues in the UK.Buckingham Palace will be closed to the public this summer for what is thought to be the first time in almost  years.The Sunday Times reports that her diary of engagements into the autumn is also on hold.She had plans for a state visit to South Africa in October, but it is not yet knownthis will go ahead.Events including Trooping the Colour, the Order of the Garter service and her summer garden parties have already been cancelled, while Royal Ascot - which she attends annually - will only take place behind closed doors,at all.The Queen has recently given two public addresses to the nation.In the first, on April , she echoed WWII forces sweetheart Dame Vera Lynn as she promised those coping with forced separation from loved ones we will meet again.Some million people watched the speech.And on VE Day, she urged Brits: Never give up - never despair.The monarch usually s from Windsor to Buckingham Palace in May before taking her annual summer break at Balmoral in July.However, royal aides say she has no engagements and will not leave Windsor until the threat from coronavirus clears.Her last public engagement was the Commonwealth Service at Westminster Abbey on March .She has been isolating at Windsor with the Duke of Edinburgh since March .Despite that, she has been in regular contact with the prime minister and other world leaders.The news comes on the day Boris Johnson prepares to outline his road map out of lockdown.Yesterday, coronavirus deaths rose to , after  more people lost their lives to the deadly disease.A royal source told The Times: “The Queen won’t do anything which goes against the advice of people in her [age] category and she’s going to take all the appropriate advice.There are discussions about what we could and couldn’t do come October.We haven’t cancelled a load of engagements, but nothing is going into Her Majesty’s diary at the moment.“If there is advice in the coming months that it’s fine for her to come back to London, she may do that, but until that time, she’d want to be seen to be being responsible in her actions for the nation.”"},{"url":null,"title":"different areas lockdown levels","story":"DIFFERENT parts of Britain could have tougher lockdown levels to handle the crisis, a minister has warned.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick today revealed the Government could soon start cracking down on the parts of the nation most affected by the coronavirus pandemic.Appearing on Sky News, Mr Jenrick explained contact tracing could help isolate where people were most at risk.He said: “There will be a centre for biosecurity that will bring this data together, monitor the progress against the virus in all parts of the country and inform our response.If we see there are particular outbreaks in particular neighbourhoods, schools, towns, we may be able to take particular measures in those places.“If there are outbreaks in one particular place we will have the opportunity to increase measures again.The senior minister also backed the new colour-coded alert scheme, ranging from green to red, which will be used to highlight increased risk from the virus.He said: It will be very transparent, people will be able to see at what point we are in controlling the virus.At the moment we believe the country is at four on a scale of five, with five being the most concerning.Our aspiration is to bring that down as swtly as we can to three.Mr Jenrick also defended the Governments new slogan advising Brits to stay alert.He said: We need to have a broader message because we want to slowly and cautiously restart the economy and the country.I understand people are anxious about the future but we want now to have a message which encourages people to go to work.It comes as the Prime Minister is set to warn the UK later today that the country is entering the most dangerous phase of the outbreak.The PM will urge “maximum caution” as he unveils his road map out of lockdown.Mr Johnson told The Sun on Sunday: “This is the dangerous bit.“We’re past the peak now but we’ll have to work even harder to get every step right.On Thursday, the Government met for their obligated three-week review, with Dominic Raab announcing in the daily press briefing that the lockdown has been extended for another three weeks.The Foreign Secretary says there is no change yet as the virus is still deadly and infectious, but some minor tweaks are expected.The PM is expected to make an address to the nation detailing a menu of options on how the nation will exit lockdown restrictions and re-energise the economy while still suppressing the spread of the virus.Some of the measures included will be to encourage those who are able toto work under strict guidelines on social distancing and hygiene.Mr Johnson is also expected to announce plans to re-open more public spaces, as long as members of the public stick to the social distancing guidelines. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:www.thesun wp-content

The Prime Minister will outline his road map to a new normality in his address to the nation at pm. Britainaposs route out of coronavirus lockdown is a five-stage plan staggered over the next six months. The Prime Minister has said the first steps will happen the next day “ we possibly can”. Ahead of the speech the PM tweeted out six updated coronavirus rules.The Prime Minister included the governmentaposs new slogan aposstay alert, control the virus, save livesapos in his tweet despite widespread criticism about its ambiguity from politicians and the public today.The previous stay home slogan has been dropped ahead of the unveiling of the governmentaposs plans to gradually ease the lockdown over the next few months.   Brits will be able to enjoy unlimited exercise from next week according to a draft -page plan to take the country out of lockdown. Since March  exercise outside the confines of the home has been limited to just one hour a day, though it is expected to be one of the first restrictions lted by Boris Johnson. The Prime Minister is also expected to allow Brits to sunbathe in their local parks - as long as they are apart from other people.Playing sports with their own household will be allowed and driving somewhere for a walk or run will also be ok under the new guidelines.For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  Garden centres    One of the only things we do know ahead of the speech is that garden centres in England will be allowed to reopen with distancing measures in place from next week, according to a senior government source. Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford has said garden centres in Wales will be able to reopen next week. Mr Drakeford said on Saturday this is very much in line with Mr Johnsonaposs plans - so expect to hear something similar from the PM. It has been made clear that one of the most likely restrictions to be eased first is to do with outdoor activities, as there is less risk of transmission here than indoors. At the moment youaposre allowed to go for a run, walk or cycle ride once a day. As with outdoor exercise, outdoor working will have less chance of transmission that indoors. Building sites were never told to close under lockdown guidance - as long as two metres could be kept between workers - so the government is expected to make a renewed push for people toto work there. But there will be more guidance on how employers can protect staff amid concern from the unions that their members could be put in danger.  More guidance on the use of outdoor spacesThis will include open-air markets, high streets and cemeteries. Experts believe the virus does not spread as quickly in the open air so the government want to begin to look at other spaces which the public could access safely. Churches and other places of worship The Government could allow places of worship, including churches and mosques, to open for private prayer but not for gatherings of groups. The Muslim Council of Britain, the UKaposs largest Muslim umbrella organisation, is consulting its members before issuing guidance this weekend for mosques that are considering reopening. The majority of the mosques that we have consulted are of the view that they do not wish to open during Ramadan, an MCB spokesman said. We do not want to be the ones who cause harm to others. The Rt Rev Sarah Mullally, the Bishop of London, is leading the Church of Englandaposs planning for reopening its buildings. She said there would have to be signicant changes to key aspects of Christian worship for some time to come. I donapost envisage, even up to the end of the year, we will be back to our normal services. Weaposll have some churches doing things dferently. And of course, this approach will depend on the part of the country you are in. Being in Devon is very dferent to being in the centre of London. So we need to approach this based on our local circumstances, she said. There are some very challenging questions that weaposll have to face, not least about singing and about the receiving of Holy Communion. So the future will look dferent. But we want to continue to support people in their spiritual journey with their faith, she told the BBC. When we open our church buildings, we will still have to ensure physical distancing.

More than six million people are currently receiving furlough payment due to the coronavirus pandemic. It is said to have cost our economy around £ billion. Business secretary Alok Sharma and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak have spoken to industry leaders and trade unions. It is now believed the government will announce a scaling down of the scheme which could come as soon as Tuesday. Craig Beaumont, director of external affairs at the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “We really hope to see progress made on a part-time furlough because smaller businesses in particular benefit from being able to quote for new work, keep in touch with employees and pay their invoices.” The Financial Times says Mr Sharma had positive signals around flexibility of the scheme in the discussions. But the original plan was to use furlough until the end of June. It currently subsidises  per cent of furloughed employeesapos wages, up to £, every month. The employees asked topart-time will only work in sectors deemed vital to protect kept on the furlough scheme, The Sun says. So, those at pubs, restaurants, hotels and the tourism industry will likely remain furloughed for the time being. Businesses in these industries may be able to apply for an extension.

After parts of the plans were briefed to newspapers people expressed their concerns over how people will interpret the change in slogan. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the Government’s new “stay alert” slogan risks ambiguity. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic,here He added: We need absolute clarity from Boris Johnson. Thereaposs no room for nuance in this. This virus exploits ambivalence, it thrives on ambiguity and I think the problem with the slogan that has been briefed to the newspapers is people will be looking slightly puzzled, questioning aposWhat does it mean to stay alert  What are the Government saying with that apos So I hope that Boris Johnson will offer us that crystal-clear clarity tonight that is desperately needed. Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hit out at the government over seemingly not briefing her on the new slogan before the papers and said she will not be using it. She wrote on Twitter : The Sunday papers is the first I’ve seen of the PM’s new slogan. It is of course for him to decide what’s most appropriate for England, but given the critical point we are at in tackling the virus, #StayHomeSaveLives remains my clear message to Scotland at this stage.MS Minister for Health and Social Services Vaughan Gething also said that Wales would not be adopting the new slogan, writing on Twitter: I’ve seen the media briefings and changed message for England.There has not been a  nations agreement or discussion on this. The @WelshGovernment message has not changed. Stay at home andyou do go out observe the social distancing rules. #StayHomeSaveLives.Top-selling Harry Potter author JK Rowling also hit out at the new messaging on Twitter.She wrote: Is Coronavirus sneaking around in a fake moustache and glasses  If we drop our guard, will it slip us a Micky Finn  What the hell is aposstay alertapos supposed to mean  Andy Burnham, the Labour Mayor of Greater Manchester, also tweeted that it feels to me like a mistake to me to drop the clear stay at home message.Dave Ward, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, said: The messaging from this Government throughout this crisis has been a total joke, but their new slogan takes it to a new level. He wondered: Stay alert  Itaposs a deadly virus not a zebra crossing. Writer and comedian Adam Kay added that it would be dficult to stay alert to something thataposs . millimetres in diameter. This pandemic is going to have as many spikes as a coronavirus. However, ministers have defended the message today, saying that the stay-home message had not gone away and that it was the right move to update and broaden it.Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick told Skyaposs Sophy Ridge that staying at home will still be a very important part of the governments message to the public - despite ditching the slogan. Mr Jenrick said it was right now to update and broaden the message to the public as the Government tries to restart the economy. I think thataposs what the public want and that they will be able to understand this message, which is that we should be staying home as much as possible but when we do go to work and go about our business we need to remain vigilant, we need to stay alert, he continued. And that means things like respecting others, remaining two metres apart, washing your hands, following the social distancing guidelines because the virus continues to be prevalent, too many people are still dying of this and weaposre going to have to live with it for a long time. Pressedthere is a danger the message is too woolly, Mr Jenrick said: Well I hope not.  We need to have a broader message because we want to slowly and cautiously restart the economy and the country. No  was also forced to defend the slogan change by putting out a statement.A spokesman said: We can control the virus by keeping the rate of infectionand the number of infections down. This is how we can continue to save lives and livelihoods as we start to recover from coronavirus. Everyone has a role to play in keeping the rate of infectiondown by staying alert and following the rules."},{"url":null,"title":"mark steel british governments clear","story":"NewsopinionMark Steel: British governments clear advice on lockdown is clearly confusingWe shouldnt be surprisednext there is a live TV game show where celebs guess new lockdown rules while taking part in an obstacle course, hosted by Davina McCallShareCommentsByMark Steel:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsopinionDavina McCall, potential host of a live TV show where celebs guess new lockdown rules \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

But that’s boring. We’re lucky, because our government is much more fun. First they told us: “Changes will be introduced from Monday.” So one Conservative newspaper announced: “Hurrah! Lockdown freedom beckons.” Then they changed their mind and said nothing can change, then that there would be some change but they wouldn’t let on what it was. Next week they’ll make it a fun game where we have to guess the change.We could try going to the beach, thenwe get tear-gassed by armed police, we’ll know it isn’t that. Or there could be a  game live on BBC in which a group of ­celebrities tries to guess the new rules by asking a series of questions while clambering round an obstacle course. Eventually Davina McCall will ask “are we allowed to drink cider with our mates at a bus shelter ”, while ­clambering up a slippery ladder, then Matt Hancock will ring a bell and we’ll know that’s the new rule. With a similar spirit, when Boris Johnson was asked whether we should wear face masks, he said they “might help”. That’s the sort of clear decisive instruction we expect from a leader in a crisis. His hero Churchill was the same, when the Germans tried to invade he said: “I suppose sending some Spitfires up against them might help. I’m not sure really, it’s up to you.” At one point there was a report that schools could be reopened on May , or maybe not. This is ideal, because le is dull when you go somewhere and know for certain itaposs open. This way, parents can take their kids to school and have the excitement of not knowing whether they’ll take them in for lessons, or all get arrested for being outside at a school gate.

We’ve been mates for  years and she knows me better than anyone. So to know she’s had the worst week of her le and I can’t be there for her is heartbreaking. And now I’m angry too. Jo’s dad was poorly. He collapsed at home and an ­ambulance came. He spent two weeks in hospital, on his own, with Jo taking him clean clothes, which she had to give to a nurse. The family knew they had to stick to the rules to protect others. Then I got the news from Jo. “Dad’s gone to sleep for good.” Hearing my soulmate go through the most painful experience of her le, I felt helpless and frustrated. I wanted to hug her, make her a cup of tea and look after things while she came to terms with a le without her hero in it. But I knew I couldn’t jump in my car and see her. Just like she had sacriced those precious final moments with her dad and couldn’t say goodbye. But you have to think of others and be a good citizen. Only, hang on, it’s okay to get your lover around for a quick bonk. Professor Neil Ferguson, the guy who instigated the lockdown and lectured the nation on social distancing, happily stuck two fingers up to his own rules. Inviting his married lover around was an “error of judgment” he said.  We’ve all been falling in line with this top scientist. When he says jump, most of us say how high – and with or without a face mask, Prof  We trusted his expertise. He was the smartest we had. So what a slap in the face to we ordinary folk when he decides it’s one rule for him and another for us. It’s a daily fear for many of us with elderly friends and relatives – them being taken to hospital, out of reach and left alone. For elderly people too, the thought of being left to die alone is too much to bear. And then the added trauma of funerals, when you can’t even say goodbye to loved ones properly.

As well as that, his strong work ethic and keen sense of order was greatly at odds with the rest of his chaotic family. Feeling like such an outsider made Joey miserable throughout his le. But when he began digging around for answers about his identity, little did he anticipate the scale of the genetic – and ethical – minefield he was about to step into. While he was growing up in Rotterdam, Holland, Joey’s parents never hid the fact they had needed help conceiving him. His dad – who already had two kids from a previous marriage – had gone through a vasectomy reversal for Joey’s mum. ‘They told me they went to a doctor because of my father,’ explains Joey, . ‘They undid the procedure because my mum really wanted to have children of their own.’ Joey’s parents insisted the fertility treatment they’d received had been straightforward – his mother had been articially inseminated with his father’s sperm. But Joey was unconvinced by this explanation: ‘I was just so dferent from my brother and sister.’ While Joey’s father drank, argued, and was constantly in debt selling the kids’ belongings for cash, Joey by contrast was sensible, calm and early on began saving for a better le. Eventually, sick of feeling so isolated, at just  Joey met his first boyfriend, moved in with him, and left his family home – for ever. ‘It was the best decision I ever made,’ he admits.  By the time Joey was , he was a successful gym owner and in a stable, loving relationship. But even though he’d been able to escape the chaos of his family home, he was dogged with unease about his identity. It nagged away at him until his father died in  and – believing he’d never get to the bottom of it – Joey’s mental health spiralled. ‘Close friends saw it was really bothering me. It became a depression when my father passed away. I thought it was grief, but it never stopped. I felt, “Maybe I’m never going to know what happened ” aposAfter three or four years, I was still in a state of depression and I didn’t want to get out of bed. It was the worst feeling I’d ever had.’  When Joey considered suicide, his psychiatrist urged him to confront his mother. So, in March , after making her a coffee and sitting her in the garden, Joey begged her for answers. ‘“Is my father my biological father  Did something happen to you  Or am I from a neighbour or somebody  ” Mum was quite upset when I asked her that. She couldn’t believe I thought she might have been with another man. It distressed her, me thinking she had been unfaithful, but I just said, “Mum, please. I have to know for sure.”’ Joey asked her to take him through exactly how he was conceived, and she said she’d seen the vials of sperm labelled with the name of Joey’s father.  When pressed on the name of the clinic and doctor, his mum’s patchy recollections led Joey to do an online search, which brought up a suburban clinic near where he grew up and the doctor Jan Karbaat. Joey was shocked to see many complaints about missing paperwork and lost vials, suspicions that women had been given the wrong sperm, and also a court case. The government had shut the clinic in . It was a horror story. Joey’s mother was so upset by these findings, she threw her son out of the house there and then. Continuing to Google Jan Karbaat sitting in his car, Joey spotted a photo of the fertility doctor behind the scandal, and got goosebumps, certain he was looking at his biological father. ‘It was like an electric shock. I couldn’t see his face, only myself. I had the same smile, the same eyes. I sent the picture to friends, they said, “Is that you, Joey ”’ Desperate for answers, Joey tracked down Karbaat, who was living locally. But when he knocked on his door, he was told the doctor, then , was too sick for visitors. A week later, he died. Robbed of the opportunity to confront him, Joey searched for answers where. He discovered a Facebook group whose members suspected they were all Karbaat’s children. Joey quickly built a rapport with Moniek Wassenaar, and noticed her Amsterdam home was strikingly similar in taste to his own. ‘We decided to seewe were really related and did a test – we were indeed half-siblings. That was the first match. It was very emotional.’  Then, in June , Joey put his results on a genealogy site that matches DNA results with others around the world. It paired him with Inge Herlaar, , who he rang, saying, ‘I think I’m your half-brother.’ Then came a match with Marsha Elvers, , another half-sister. At the time of Karbaat’s death in , he was thought to have had  recognised children from several marriages, and was suspected of secretly fathering  more with his patients – without their permission. In early  a court decision was ruled allowing Karbaat’s DNA to be released for testing. Receiving the confirmation he was Karbaat’s son was momentous for Joey. ‘When I saw it written down, I broke,’ he admits. ‘It was almost too much to process.’ Joey has at least  known siblings and the family keeps growing. With dark humour they’ve called themselves the ‘Karbastards’. ‘Now, I’m no longer angry – but I am curious,’ says Joey. ‘I have the puzzle in my head, but I can’t put the pieces together. ‘Maybe he did it because of the money, maybe he had a God complex. That’s what everyone says. But I think, at the start, he just wanted to help mothers have children.’ Last month, Joey visited Karbaat’s grave in Rotterdam. ‘It was the closest I could get to him. That was the most important thing so I could have peace of mind. I’m not responsible for his wrongdoings and his actions, but I need to forgive him to move on. I deserve that.’ Three more fertility doc outrages Shockingly, Jan Karbaat is not the only doctor to have committed fertility fraud – but no fertility doctor has ever been put behind bars for using their own sperm.  Donald Cline In May  it emerged that physician Donald Cline, who’d featured in People magazine, had used his own sperm in the s and s while treating women in Indianapolis. Cline was exposed after one of the people conceived at his clinic took a andMe DNA test, only to discover several unexpected half-siblings, whose mothers had all been Cline’s patients. Norman Barwin A pillar of the Jewish community in Ottawa, Barwin was head of the Canadian Fertility Society and had received the Queen’s Golden Jubilee Medal. Like Karbaat, he was first accused of chaotic record keeping, which led to women being given the wrong sperm. But in  it emerged he’d been using his own sperm. He’s currently being sued by a group of his biological children, and their legal mothers and fathers, his former patients.

I have been separated from my children, Hannah, , and Louis, nine, since the end of March after making the agonising decision that it would be safer for themthey stayed with my sister while I continue to work -hour shts as a midwe. I love my job, I always have, but I feel particularly proud to do it at the moment. Pregnant women still need to come into the hospital. Babies still need to be born. I work in the assessment unit – which is the AE for pregnant women – and on a ward that looks after themthey are unwell. And right now, it is even scarier for the women as they have to come in on their own, feeling frightened, and their partners can only join them once they are in established labour. We’ve always provided support, but now we are doing so on a dferent level – we are also having to be their birthing partner during the early stages. Unfortunately, some of the women have caught coronavirus, and being at the hospital puts me at risk so, as a single mum to Hannah and Louis, I realised I had to make a very tough decision about my family’s safety when the country went into lockdown. I didn’t want to put my family in danger by bringing it home and possibly passing it on to them. And while, touch wood, I have not had coronavirus and nor have any of my colleagues yet, I knew I had to do somethingI was going to continue to work – giving up wasn’t an option for me. I want to be able to look after the women who are poorly and feeling so scared. I feel very protected because we have full PPE. We’ve had it for a long time – before we wore it for the ones who were poorly with things like flu, but now we wear it all for everyone because you don’t knowsomeone is carrying coronavirus or not. It was actually my sister, Rachael, who suggested the idea to have the children to stay with her and my brother-in-law Kurran, because my parents are self-isolating and it wasn’t possible for them to help with the childcare.  We asked the children how they felt and they were excited about the idea because they knew they would get spoilt rotten, so they moved in with my sister on the st March, straight after both their birthdays. It felt incredibly weird at first and it was – and still is – so quiet without them. The silence is something I will never get used to. I miss them so much. I miss putting them to bed, the evenings together, doing their homework with them, all the normal, everyday things you take for granted. I work -hour shts and I have roughly three days off a week . I walk over to see them. It takes me  minutes to get there and another  to walk back and so I do this as my hour’s exercise allowance. My sister has got a good size garden and so I am at one end and they are at the other. I stay for about half an hour and we talk to each other. But the hardest thing, by far, is not being able to get close and hug them. Thankfully they do have their phones and we talk on FaceTime as well. When I’ve had a hard and long day, I am often tired and just need to sleep. I also talk to my work colleagues. They really understand and are a great support.  They are so resilient though. I separated from Louis’ dad at the end of last year, which was really hard for them. I met him two years after Hannah’s dad, Lance Corporal Kenneth Rowe, was killed in  in Afghanistan. She was only three-months old and sadly never met her dad because she was born two weeks after he went to Afghanistan. He should have come home the day before he died but there was no cover so he’d stayed on and was killed by a rocket grenade. I had never feared anything would happen to him because nobody in his regiment had ever died before. I naively thought we were quite safe despite him being on the frontline. When I was told he was never going to come back, our whole world was shattered. It was absolutely horrendous. It was a few years later, in , that I decided to train as a midwe. I’d always had office jobs and I wanted a career that would give others the kind of experience I had when I was pregnant. My midwives made me feel empowered when I gave birth and I wanted to make other people feel like that. No day is ever the same and I feel fortunate to have a job I enjoy so much.  The pregnant women on our ward can’t have anyone to visit and they are all alone. It’s so harsh for them and we are doing our best to raise their spirits. It’s so tough not being with my kids, but my colleagues – or my work family, as I call them – have been amazing. Nobody  understands what it is like to be working constantly throughout this and having absolutely nobody at home when you get back. We all get very emotional during the clapping on a Thursday, I have been in work the last couple of weeks and all the emergency services have turned up to clap with us, too. They stand outside. It’s been so moving and it’s nice that the NHS has got the recognition it deserves. I hope people will remember the sacrices people are making. I don’t know how I am going to ever be able to repay my sister and brother-in-law for what they have done for me and I can’t thank them enough for their incredibly kind gesture. I’m keeping my fingers crossed it will be safe for Hannah and Louis to come home before too long. The first thing I’m going to do is treat them to pizza. And give them a massive hug…  Help at a dficult time Helen has shared her story to help raise awareness about a charity close to her heart – Scotty’s Little Soldiers, which was set up to help children who have lost a parent who served in the British Armed Forces. When Helen’s partner, Hannah’s dad, was killed in Afghanistan, their world fell apart. But thanks to the charity, they have met other families going through the same nightmare.

The boss of the discount supermarket wrote to customers earlier today outlining signicant changes that will be coming into force in its stores. CEO Giles Hurley said: Working together, we have continued to make changes to protect you and our colleagues, and to ensure we can feed the nation, including the most vulnerable, at this unprecedented time. Most recently, we have begun providing our store and distribution colleagues with the option of wearing face masks, and of accessing the Government’s Covid- testing programme.For updates on the coronavirus pandemic, read our blog hereThese moves were in addition to the other measures we have put in place to provide you with a safe, efficient and affordable shopping experience when you visit your local Aldi store. These include:Providing gloves to all store and distribution workers Installing clear screens at more than , checkouts Limiting the number of people in store at any one time Encouraging customers to shop alone, where possible, and adhere to one person per trolley Installing two-metre floor markers and increased in-store signage promoting physical distancing Encouraging customers to use contactless payment such as contactless cards, Apple Pay and Google Pay rather than cash, where possibleThese measures would not have been as effective without you playing your part by following our guidelines with patience and understanding, said Hurley. There are bound to be more changes to come in these and other areas of our everyday lives. Whatever they may be, the steps we have taken are important and we expect that they – and your continued support for them – will be needed for the foreseeable future. Another issue that is not going away is the need for us all to make our money go further.Hurley repeated his guarantee that Aldi will continue to offer the lowest prices of any supermarket in Britain. Whatever changes we make in store – and I will of course keep you updated whenever we do – I want you to know that whenever you shop at Aldi, you can be certain that the price you pay at the till will be the lowest of any supermarket, he added.  It follows earlier social distancing measures, which include a no touch policy, floor markings, checkout safety screens and a one-adult-per-shop policy. To avoid overcrowding, the grocer has listed the busiest and quietest times to visit its stores, with the use of a traffic light system uploaded to its website. NHS, police and fire service workers with valid ID now get priority access in queues at all times.

In an adorable video filmed by the park, the tiny babies can be seen starting to spread their wings in the sunshine. Their care team hoped the five feathered siblings would put a smile on the faces of hardworking nurses and doctors. One little male has been named Thomas, after St Thomas’ Hospital, London where Prime Minister Boris Johnson was nursed back to health, after he caught the deadly bug. Another bundle of fluff is called Arrowe, after Arrowe Park Hospital, in The Wirral, where the first UK coronavirus patients were treated. Their sister has been named Countess as the zoo’s nearest clinic is Countess of Chester Hospital. Finally, keepers opted for Florence and Bevan, after infamous nurse Florence Nightingale and Aneurin Bevan who founded the NHS. The fluffy group have all been weighed and are in top condition, as shown in the video.  They’re clearly absolutely loving getting lots of attention and are nestling into zoo le. Lead Penguin Keeper, Anne Morris, said: “Although it’s still early days, the chicks look really healthy and the parents are doing a fab job of caring for their new arrivals.” The cute clip, shows the parent penguins are fast becoming very busy birds, despite the chicks’ first days mostly consisting of cuddles in their nest.  Soon their offspring will become super hungry and chomp their way through enough fish to treble their bodyweight in a matter of weeks. The tiny siblings are Humboldt penguins - one of the rarest species of penguin on Earth. While the litter will help the breeding programme run by Chester Zoo, their wild counterparts are struggling to survive as their homeland of Peru and Chile is hit with climate change and over-fishing.

Itaposs been fun and games, she joked, while admitting it actually took a lot of hard graft. The Radfords started the transformation of their tried-looking garden last week, with pictures showing a mountain of rumble after levelling out the ground. Even two-year-old Archie was in his element“ and happily mucked in armed with a broom and drill while dad Noel supervised. One person commented: “Omg donapost know how u do it I have  children getting them motivated is so hard well done you have a lovely family please give me tips on how u get the children to listen lol.“ And just  hours later, on Tuesday, they created a water park and play area in their very own back garden which looks totally awesome. It includes a swing set, slide, climbing frame as well as a mud kitchen.  They have also added some cute personalised teepees, with a comfy seating area for all the family.Sue and Noel shared videos of the outdoor set-up on their Instagram Stories and YouTube showing their family enjoying the garden and enjoying some ice lollies.Some also took their scooters for a whizz. on the astroturf. Meanwhile, they also added a dinosaur-themed water feature which comes with a mini slide and a large paddling pool for the children to cool off in. The couple bought the Victorian property, a former care home in Morecambe, more than  years ago and keep it in immaculate condition. They first found fame in  when their lives were the focus of a Channel  documentary called  Kids and Counting Sue fell pregnant with her first child at age .

Tory peer Ros Altmann, a former ­pensions minister, is leading demands for radical change to prevent a catastrophe in the “financially unsustainable” sector. She warns looking after our , care home residents is now “a game of financial pass the parcel where hedge fund companies cash in on company debts”. And she adds bluntly: “Unfortunately, the parcels are old people’s lives – there’s nothing to stop them in this system.” Covid- has claimed the lives of at least , residents so far. Baroness Altmann told the Sunday People: “It’s possible we may need to nationalise the sector. We ­cannot let these companies go bust. “They are heavily loaded with debt and unless owners are willing to put equity in – which they haven’t been – they are not financially sustainable. “This is not new and there has never been proper control over financial backing for homes. With Covid-, the sector has come crashing down because it’s not ­integrated into the health service.“The coronavirus crisis in care homes is a continuation of the broken system that has been getting worse for years. What this has done is created a disaster for the most frail and vulnerable in our society.“Their needs have not been taken with the same seriousness as the needs of the NHS. A service and NHS system has been prioritised over these people’s lives. “The idea of freeing up capacity in the NHS – sending infected older people back to care homes where the staff didn’t have enough PPE and other residents could catch it – doesn’t bear thinking about. But that is what has happened.  “It brings me to tears to think of these elderly relying on our system, at the mercy of the crisis. We’ve protected the NHS as our totemic system while social care needs have been pushed aside. Care has always been the Cinderella part of our system.” Baroness Altmann said taxpayers must foot the bill for integrating health and care – a call echoed by Labour’s former Health Secretary Andy Burnham. Writing in the New Statesman ­yesterday, Mr Burnham, now Mayor of Greater Manchester, said social care has more in common with ­insurance-led US healthcare than “British values of fairness” ­embodied by the NHS. He said: “In , I proposed a National Care Service. The problem is it would still maintain two separate systems when they need to be one.  “Now I favour social care provided on NHS terms as part of a single, fully-integrated system.” Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Our care sector is highly vulnerable and many homes are run by offshore companies. “We need social care to be put on a ­sustainable footing for the future – which is why Labour has talked about a National Care Service.”Labour pledged a National Care Service in the  election, and Boris Johnson vowed to deliver a plan to “fix the crisis” within  days of him becoming PM. That ­deadline passed in mid-March.In ,  per cent of ­residential and nursing home beds were provided by local authorities or the NHS. By  it was six per cent. Councils still covered  per cent of home care from visiting staff in  – but by  this was down to  per cent.  Critics say that since then, austerity has let private providers flood the sector. While local authorities pay a flat rate for beds for those who cannot afford care, private operators charge their own rates. For-profit companies now own ,, or . per cent, of England’s , care home beds, the IPPR think-tank found – up from  per cent in .  Labour previously pledged £.billion to buy care homes and build new ones, plus £.billion a year to run the sector.

With everyone done up to the nines, the local residents did their very best to help cheer up one of their neighbours on their th birthday, after his initial plans of marking the occasion in Las Vegas were thwarted. Tanyaaposs friend and local DJ Nathan Jones played records from a specially-converted Las Vegas-themed disco booth on the roof of his van at the foot of the -storey flats. Nathan, who goes by the DJ name Motel Concierge, converted his Ford van into a mobile DJ booth which he has dubbed ‘Disco Vandross’ so he can continue to play songs to people despite the lockdown. His Disco Motel concept involves, as Wales Online put it, a “specially converted Las Vegas-themed disco booth on the roof of his van.” Police officers did check on the event but were satisfied that social distancing was being observed and let the neighbours party on into the night.

The Manchester doctor said drink-related incidents and violence spiked on Friday night as patients appearing to have been injured defying lockdown landed in the emergency department.Dr Ben Stewart said his team were shocked at the numbers of people requiring treatment last night and well into the early hours of this morning, reports the Manchester Evening News.He described chaotic scenes during his . hour sht, with many patients being taken to hospital for alcohol or drug related injuries.The doctor said AE had been noticeably quieter since the UKaposs lockdown was introduced, due to people avoiding hospitals because of coronavirus and less people going out drinking.But that changed last night as the long weekend kicked off with a scorching start and Brits flocked outdoors. Follow our live blog for the latest coronavirus news and updatesThe docotor said it was back to the apospre-lockdown daysapos and it appeared a lot of people had become relaxed about the restroctions. He said: The number of alcohol or drug related accidents, violence and crime rocketed last night. The police we saw said it had been their busiest night since New Year’s Eve . We knew it was going to be busier than normal. Bank Holidays are always busier. The NHS for the last four or five weeks in AE, it became a lot more quiet.  We thought we would see a bit of a peak, but it was just a shock to everybody really. The doctor said people were attending for drink-driving injuries, cars flipping over, assaults and even violent stabbings. He said there were still patients coming in with Covid- symptoms, but the majority were for drink related incidents and had attended alongside the police. Dr Stewart said: You are celebrating defeating a big enemy, but we are back in the same situation now. We need to be sensible, but people have got relaxed about it. I saw  or  patients last night, two had Covid-, one had a headache, the rest were assaults or car accidents.  All kinds of unnecessary incidents. I am hoping everybody will wake up with a bit of a hangover today and today will be better. But it is a long weekend, with a Saturday included, and I am preparing myself for the worst. It is definitely back to the pre-lockdown days. We had seen a drop in footfall with people coming in, which is good as people who are genuinely sick are getting seen at the door. People forget that we still have people coming in with coronavirus. They are taking up a lot of our resources. But it has gone back to the good old days of everyone getting drunk and relying on AE. I think in the North West we have surpassed London. We knew we would trail behind them, we have probably just peaked.  You donapost climb Everest and open few cans of beer at the top, you donapost stop until you are back at base camp. People can have a good time, but we are not through everything yet. There is still a potential second wave particularly in the North West. The doctors comments come after up to  people were seen meeting to drink champagne in Salford Quays. Footage emerged showing cars blocking the road at Media City as a group of people were spotted playing music. Residents said there were at aposleast  peopleapos present, with as many as apos peopleapos then showing up for the party from around .pm on Friday. A man was also taken to hospital with a head injury after a aposviolent disturbanceapos broke out on Mersey Bank Avenue, in Chorlton on Saturday morning.

Cumbria Police have revealed several examples of violating motorists with the message: Lockdown is still on. The Lake District is still closed. On Saturday a driver was stopped as he attempted to drive from Manchester to Dundee so he could buy a puppy.

Police said they violations are happening regularly with them describing the actions of three men who had travelled from Stockport to Cumbria to feed the ducks as quackers. Other drivers ly claimed they were on their way to work but it took little detective work to unravel the truth. Meanwhile in other parts of the country police were also weeding out drivers ignoring the lockdown. A checkpoint was set up at the end of the A into Patcham to stop bored families flocking to Brighton to enjoy the hot weather on Saturday.Officers from Surrey and Sussex Road Policing Unit turned back scores of cars and fined some drivers for breaching the lockdown rules. One motorist travelled more than  miles from Milton Keynes in Buckinghamshire. Residents cheered and voiced their support their actions.

It is a fabulous property but an acquired taste, Powsney said. Guys love it, but the women not so much. It has been a fantastic experience and I have learned a lot, but it is time to move on. I am  now. I was not a Fred fan at first, but the place is like the house in The Shining. It takes over you, it is a wonderful place steeped in history. The building known locally as aposTwo Catsapos is set in woodland on the banks of the River Tonge, not far from Bolton town centre. Mr Powsney purchased the Grade II-listed property for £, in , after it had failed to sell at auction. We originally intended to move to Spain, Mr Powsney explained. We sold our house but the credit crunch came so we bought that instead. I had no intention of turning it into a business, but we had that many people wanting to look around.He turned the property into the Fred Dibnah Heritage Centre, which soon became a site of pilgrimage for fans of one of Boltonaposs most famous sons. In , the centre was put on the market for £.m, with the couple ready to let go due to their age. Mr Powsney remained there until  after several unsuccessful attempts to find a buyer he decided to close the centre and sell off Fredaposs machinery - all additional attempts to sell the property have also since failed. He even put it up as a prize in a aposspot the ballapos competition he organised in  with entrants told they could get their hands on it for just £ - the cost of a single entry.However, the competition failed to reach anywhere near the minimum number of entries, which was set at ,, and Powsney had to give the winner a £, cash prize instead. The spot the ball competition was dreadful. For a tenner, someone could have owned it with no mortgage. It could have given someone the chance to get on the housing ladder, he said. The house was then put up for auction last September with a guide price of £,, but failed to sell again.In a fresh attempt to find a buyer, the home is now being marketed by Hunters estate agents for £,. While Powsney says he would be willing to sell to whoever meets the asking price, he believes it would be ideal for one of Boltonaposs Menaposs Shed groups. The groups are a type of community hub for men that have become increasingly important in the fight against loneliness and social isolation.

And schools will begin a phased reopening at the start of June, beginning with Year  primary leavers. But to deter those tempted to breach social distancing rules fines will be hiked from £ to £ and rise to £, for serial offenders. Garden centres, repair shops and hardware stores will be allowed to reopen from Monday. And non-contact sports such as golf and fishing are to resume soon after that. The details emerged as:The UK death toll rose  to ,. Thousands of British doctors revealed they had run out of PPE. US doctors began trialling a drug used for schizophrenia after tests showed it blocked Covid- in mice. Worrying figures showed at least  women were killed in domestic violence attacks during the first six weeks of lockdown.The PM is to give further details of his roadmap out of lockdown in a televised address to the nation at pm – after a COBRA meeting to finalise details this afternoon. His lockdown announcement in March attracted an audience of  million. A No source said: “This is a critical moment. We will proceed with maximum caution. “We must not risk a second peak which might overwhelm the NHS.” Safety guidance for workplaces will be published this week, though for most working from home will continue. Only outdoor working such as construction will be encouraged. Mr Johnson will confirm all visitors to the UK must quarantine for  days – provoking howls of anguish from aviation and tourism sectors. Commons Home Affairs Committee chair Yvette Cooper said: “It appears the Government is playing catch-up at the borders. Other countries are operating checks or isolation even while their travel numbers are low.” The plan for a staggeredof schools and colleges is to have them up and running before the summer holidays at the end of July so parents can go back to work.  But that will depend on how the Year goes. Pupils may either have to attend on alternate days or be taught in smaller groups in dferent classrooms. On the economy, Chancellor Rishi Sunak is now working on ending the furlough scheme which pays  per cent of the wages – up to £, a month – of the . million workers who have been laid off. He may drop the subsidy to  per cent to reduce the £billion a month bill, or allow workers to do some hours as they do in Germany, France, Sweden and Canada. The plan is to review each phase of lting of restrictions every two weeks and clamp down againinfection rates rise.  The early stages will see the NHS resume regular appointments and treatments which were abandoned when the pandemic began. Families and friends may then be allowed to meet in small groups of no more than four. Later this summer outdoor bars and cafés could reopen, along with businesses in which staff can safely keep a social distance. And more shops will be able to trade, though shopping centres are likely to remain shut. As infection rates keep going down, small weddings and baptisms will be allowed and barbers and hairdressers will be able to start work again. Cinemas and museums could open with social distancing and Premier League matches take place behind closed doors. But that prospect appalled West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner David Jamieson, who fears fans will gather at stadiums. He added: “I can’t see how matches could take place without signicant risk to fans, local people and brave police officers.” Transport Secretary Grant Shapps warned at the No update that public transport will not be able to cope with ato work and people will have to walk or cycle. Andmore workers took their cars cities would soon become gridlocked. He offered rented e-scooters for the whole country instead. The Transport Secretary said social distancing on buses and trains means they will only be able to carry one in  of the passengers they usually do. He promised £billion to make roads safer for pedestrians and cyclists and to create bus and bike-only streets within weeks. GPs could even prescribe bicycles. And more people using them would maintain the clean air of lockdown – cutting the , annual deaths from pollution. Mr Shapps added: “This is an opportunity to make us fitter mentally and physically.” London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: “Everyone who can work from home must continue to. For those who must travel to work, enabling more people to walk and cycle will be critical.” And David Renard, of the Local Government Association, added: “This new way of travelling is likely to become part of everyday le once the coronavirus measures are lted and beyond.” But Shadow Green Transport Minister Kerry McCarthy said: “We need a comprehensive plan to get our public transport moving again especially for those that can’t cycle to work.” Mr Shapps was asked by the Sunday Mirror how parents could cycle to work for the day before schools were fully up and running and wrap-around childcare such as breakfast and after-school clubs were available.

Stephanie Scolaro offered two appointments for the procedure to an undercover reporter, despite the Government requiring beauty salons to close to the public. The -year-old boasted of “Covid glam packages” at her spa LA Beauty Dolls in West London. Asked why she was offering the service, the millionaire heiress said: “This has seriously stressed me out.This has basically ruined my day. We have not seen anybody face to face. This is so unnecessary.” Her spokesman later added: “Stephanie apologises unreservedly for agreeing to an appointment, but was just assuming Boris Johnson was going to announce the easing of restrictions on Sunday.” Stephanie swerved jail in January  after admitting to importing £, worth of endangered python skin fashion accessories into the UK at Southwark Crown Court. The Government Approved Register, Save Face, has had more than  complaints about social media adverts for procedures since lockdown started.  Boss Ashton Collins said: “Practitioners who offer Social isolation applies to all - both you and the practitioner.It’s not safe to invite a stranger you know is visiting other homes, into your home nor is it safe to go their home or place of work.Practitioners cannot manage the risks, no matter what they might tell you about measures they may be taking.These are not essential treatments that you can resume when the danger to us all has passed. Practitioners who continue to offer a service in this way are not safe, not responsible, not ethical and are to be avoided.” "},{"url":null,"title":"miracle baby born one day","story":"NewsMiracle baby born one day after mum told she tested positive for coronavirusEXCLUSIVE Yumi Palmer fell ill with flu-like symptoms and lost her sense of smell -hours before a long, traumatic, labour to welcome her baby boyShareCommentsByMatthew Barbour:,  MAY NewsYumi Palmer called  after suffering flu-like symptoms and was told to self-isolate\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Yumi, , then spent eight terrying days fearing her baby would be born with the disease before being rushed to hospital when her waters broke. But after a traumatic -hour labour and a birth in which she suffered serious bleeding, she is now back home with Matt and healthy son Ori – and has tested negative for the virus. “We’re counting our blessings every minute of every day,” says Yumi. “To be home with my husband and our beautul boy, all of us healthy, is all we need.” The couple had announced the pregnancy as a surprise to their wedding guests in August last year.

Meanwhile Ori was given antibiotics to ward off a suspected infection.

As the UK heads into its eighth week of strict social distancing, nine in ten people surveyed for a Sun on Sunday poll say they do not want the Prime Minister to ease restrictions yet. Most Brits fear a second wave of the deadly bug more than the economic consequences of businesses and workplaces being shut, the research by Deltapoll found. Just four per cent of adults say they want a phasedto work starting now, and only two per cent feel lockdown has gone on for too long. This is despite eight in tenalso feeling concerned about the damage restrictions will do to the economy. Nearly halfeven believe their jobs could disappearthe crisis goes on much longer. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here It comes as Boris Johnson prepares to address the nation tonight, setting out a roadmap for what le in the UK will look like over the coming weeks and months. Under current measures to slow the spread of Covid-, Brits cannot leave their homes unless shopping for food, attending a medical appointment, helping a vulnerable person or taking exercise once a day. But with the countryaposs death toll now topping , after a further  deaths were reported today, a third of Britswant restrictions to remain in place until the highly contagious virus is dealt with.Half of adults are content to remain at hometheir wages continue to be covered by their employer, or the governmentaposs furlough scheme. Deltapoll director Martin Boon says the result show that the UK public fears the virus more than its economic consequences. So far, Britain’s workers are happy to stay locked up so long as money keeps flowing their way, even though many fear for the country’s economic future, he said.  “There is a real fear that the economy is going down the tubes but the public still puts handling of the virus and lives lost ahead of economic consequences. The poll also shows a majority of the public approve of Mr Johnsonaposs handling of the crisis, with  per cent saying he is doing well and  per cent saying he is doing badly. However, there are concerns about the shortages of personal protective equipmentfor NHS workers, with % saying the government is doing badly in this area. Meanwhile % are worried about the crisis in care homes, and do not feel residents and staff have been adequately protected. The PM is expected to tell the country to stay alert, control the virus and save lives when he outlines his road map to a new normality later today. Mr Johnson is planning to tell workers who cannot do their jobs from home to begin ing to their workplaces while following social-distancing rules.

Simone - who was a close friend of Dianaaposs until her death in  - says the Princess fears her younger son faces disaster after deciding to step back from the royal family with his we Meghan Markle earlier this year.In her letter to William, she wrote: Diana made me promise to keep an eye on both you and Harry to make sure you’re both OK, and to give you warnings of danger signs. I am writing, actually I’m begging you, to listen because Meghan will isolate Harry, and eventually cause him to attempt radical, possibly lethal, ­self-destructive actions. If you want to respond, feel free. We MUST save Harry. The healer says she used to chat to Diana for up to  hours at a time on the phone when she was still alive and that she now makes regular appearances at her London home. Diana comes and talks to me – I see her body and she’s very animated at times. I got so fed up of it all I wrote to William, but he hasn’t responded, Simone explains. “It’s going from bad to worse. “Harry’s been separated from everything he loves – his family and his friends, including the Army boys he loved. “Diana told me Harry is feeling more and more isolated and it’s like torture for him. “Diana told me it was all going to end in disaster. Simone, who met Diana in  at the Hale Clinic in west London, warned that something was going to happen to her that would be the death of her before her death in a car crash in Paris. The psychic also predicted that Meghan was pregnant with the coupleaposs son Archie before the news was formally announced. She has previously also written to Harry, before his wedding. She added: I’m going to write one more letter to him, but I’m told he and William refuse to read correspondence from their mother’s friends because they have been told we are not to be trusted. It’s so sad as it’s the only way they will get to hear the full truth about their mother.

A group of up to  people observed Covid- social distancing rules as they gathered at a petrol station forecourt in Stretford, Manchester, where the incident took place. Mobile phone footage widely shared on social media showed an altercation on Wednesday night between a black man and two white police officers. The man is seen standing next to a marked police car and puts down his crying son before moments later he falls to the ground as a Taser is fired by one of the officers. The boy then becomes hysterical and screams daddy. Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has questioned whether the Taser use was proportionate or justied and has demanded an urgent review.Greater Manchester Police has voluntarily referred the matter to the Independence Office for Police Conduct . Among the protesters at the event staged by Stand Up to Racism on Saturday were Paul Davidson, a minister at the Church of God of Prophecy.  He said: I am here because this news has outraged black people nationally. We are obviously keen to find out what the details are and whether there are other circumstances we havenapost learned from the immediate clip. Butthe immediate clip is anything to go by then people have questions to answer and we should expect answers as a community. This sort of behaviour should not be expected by anyone in a civilised society.  The man who was hit with the Taser, Desmond Ziggy Mombeyarara, , appeared before magistrates on Friday where he admitted a number of offences including speeding, drink driving, failing to stop and unnecessary travel. He denied two counts of resisting a constable in the execution of their duty and the case was adjourned to a later date. In an interview with The Times, Mr Mombeyara said he did not believe such a magnitude of force was warranted.He said his son was still in shock and thought that police had shot him. He told the newspaper: I was saying to the officers, aposLet us calm the situation for the little one because the little one doesnapost feel comfortableapos. But they were making out like I was using him as a human shield. The scene was caught on camera by an eyewitness.GMP said the incident has been reviewed by the GMP Professional Standards Branch and that they have voluntarily referred this matter to the Independent Office for Police Conduct . Superintendent Mark Kenny, commented: We are aware of public concern regarding this arrest and I want to reassure the public that this matter is being reviewed and treated seriously.In addition we have voluntarily referred this matter to the IOPC.  Mayor of Greater Manchester Andy Burnham has issued a statement. He said: On Friday morning , a video was brought to my attention of a police incident at a petrol station in Greater Manchester involving two police officers, a man, a child and the use of a taser. . I was concerned about what I saw and immediately asked GMP to look into it and provide me with an explanation of what had happened.

The least we deserve infrom Boris Johnson and his ministers is transparency and honesty. What we get are lies, damned lies and dodgy statistics. A political lie is the willingness to deceive. Matt Hancock promised , tests a day by the end of April. When the th arrived, the Health Secretary simply mailed out an extra , to meet his figure. It was the Covid- equivalent of a cheque in the post. And he has missed his target six days in a row. So the nation will have little confidence in Mr Johnson’s pledge of , by the end of this month. A political lie is the failure to tell the unnished truth. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick boasted of , surgical gowns from Turkey. They did not arrive next day as promised. When they did they were useless – a fact revealed by a newspaper, not the Government. A political lie is to claim there was enough PPE –and that became a damn lie as the lack of it costs lives. We are heading towards  frontline deaths. Claims that shortages were down to distribution dficulties were branded by the Enfield council leader Nesil Caliskan as “an absolute lie”. On becoming PM, Mr Johnson pledged to begin work immediately “to fix the crisis in social care once and for all”. Had he been telling the truth, care homes would not be in the desperate state they are now.  It was American writer Mark Twain who popularised the phrase “lies, damned lies and statistics”. His point was that numbers can be manipulated. No government is immune. Labour claimed it hit targets for patients to spend no longer than four hours in AE. But they were simply put in other parts of the hospital before time was up. The Tories reduced hospital waiting lists by not putting people on them. No’s daily graphs are today’s version of this sleight of hand. At first they appeared to show Covid- deaths on a similar trajectory as those in Italy, France and Spain. Only pressure to include victims outside hospitals revealed the true gruesome picture. If ministers had been straight with us we’d have known earlier we were heading for Europe’s highest toll. The statistics we do believe are of the sort compiled by the British Medical Association which show , doctors reporting no eye protection,  with no scrubs,  with no goggles and  without gloves.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

The beauty and calm of the island made a lasting impression on me.#The monuments of Kilmartin Glen are also at the very heart of the book’s major themes, including kingship and the sacredness of landscape.#And it was at Dunadd that Aidan would have seen the kings of Dál RiataPortals to this other-world still survive, suggested by mountains, forgotten ruins, holy wells and standing stones, crosses and caves, said Mr Connell.Born in Newcastle, he now lives in Cumbria, England, with his partner and their daughter.He previously worked for titles including The Edinburgh Evening News, with bylines in The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday.The book has been published by Culture and Democracy Press and is available to purchase online through Amazon for £."},{"url":null,"title":"national theatre announces new digital programming","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe National Theatre has announced the next two productions to be streamed live on YouTube every Thursday at pm.The screenings are part of National Theatre at Home the new initiative to bring content to the public accessed from their homes during coronavirus.Productions announced today include the NT Live broadcast of Danny Boyle’s production of Frankenstein filmed at the National Theatre in , which sees Benedict Cumberbatch and Jonny Lee Miller alternating the roles of Victor Frankenstein and his creation.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

This has led to some amazing acts of kindness on every street, in every village and town across the country. Communities have never felt stronger. Today, we shine a light on just some of the people from communities across the country to showcase examples of ordinary people doing extraordinarily kind and helpful things.CASE STUDYGAIL REDMONDCHARITY that supports families has noticed a sharp rise in requests for help due to widespread redundancies.Gail Redmond of Via Wings’ in the County Down town of Dromore, in Northern Ireland, says the charity normally gives out  food bags a month to people in need.“But last week we gave out  already, many of which are going to people who are self-isolating,” she said.“One guy who contacted me on Friday, said: I have never asked anyone for help like this before. But I have lost my job and can’t afford to feed my kids right now.’ You could tell that he was absolutely mortied and so humble. So many people have lost their jobs.“We have told pensioners not to answer their door when we deliver, but one old lady insisted. We told her she shouldn’t be doing that, but she replied: I just want to say thank you’.“The older generation are so apologetic when asking for help, they all say: I’m sorry to bother you’.”Christian charity Via Wings is offering food deliveries and befriending to anyone who is self-isolating, elderly, vulnerable, an NHS employee, key workers, or those financially impacted by Covid-.Volunteers observe social distancing guidelines and food is carefully wiped down before being packed. Food and toiletry donations can be made at Eurospar, Supervalu and Vivo in Dromore and Tescosand Lidl in Banbridge.Via Wings works with local schools and churches, social workers, care workers and other agencies.“Working in unity is what our grandparents used to do, and that is what we need to get back to doing, caring for each other,” Gail added.“There is no ownership, we are just working together.”CASE STUDYNEIL MUSGROVEPicture# NEIL MUSGROVE SUBMITTED BY LEEDS CARESAN ULTRA-MARATHON runner is putting his best foot forward after several running events planned for this year had to be cancelled or postponed.Last year Neil Musgrove ran seven ultra-marathons and with none looking likely for this year he is running one in his back garden.He is doing a mile a day in his back garden according to his running watch and is hoping to reach his goal of the  mile starting distance for an ultra marathon by the end of April.For every mile completed, Neil is donating £ to Leeds Cares and hopes that friends and family will join in with the challenge at their own homes and donate after every mile completed.He said: “With no ultra-marathons to run I thought I’ll run one of my own. Any experience I’ve had with Leeds Hospitals in the past has been positive, I want to support all of our amazing NHS staff who are currently under huge pressure and working in extremely tough circumstances.“It is quite a few laps. All being well this takes me to a  mile ultra marathon distance. Yes it might get a little tedious but I am thinking of it as an ultra with a checkpoint, food and drink at every mile.“My young niece and nephew have already got involved and I’m hoping to get my own kids involved too. I’m sharing the challenge with my colleagues and running club team-mates so hopefully lots of us will get involved. Make it as interesting as you like. I am thinking about obstacles, singing, dancing, whatever. I would love itpeople joined in. The only rules are it has to be a minimum of one mile. It has to be fully within your own property boundary. If you don’t have a garden, special dispensation is given to use your street but remember the two metre rule.”All funds raised through Neil’s challenge will go towards Leeds Cares’ Support Your NHS Hospitals Appeal and provide vital support to frontline staff at Leeds Teaching Hospitals.This includes, paying for care packages, assistance with travel and accommodation where needed, as well as helping to fund other health and wellbeing initiatives to boost morale across the wards. He set a target of £ on his JustGiving page and has raised more than £ already.Leeds Cares is the official charity partner of Leeds Teaching Hospitals. The organisation supports NHS staff to deliver the best care for patients and their families, by raising funds for equipment, services, education and research.Leeds Cares works collaboratively with all of the hospitals across Leedsto identy charitable projects and causes.CASE STUDYSTENHOUSEMUIR FCHOME ADVANTAGE: Stenhousemuir players brought food directly to people’s houses.A FOOTBALL club initiative is supporting hundreds of families by delivering school meals to pupils during the coronavirus lockdown.With the season shut down indefinitely, Stenhousemuir FC set up its community help hotline in mid-March to assist the most vulnerable members of society as the effects of the global pandemic began to take hold.A -strong squad of volunteers was assembled in the first week to carry out everyday tasks like shopping or dog walking for those in isolation or for whom such activities would prove dficult. Since then, the number of volunteers has hit  although extra help remains welcome.Government guidelines mean the volunteers can leave their homes to help a vulnerable person and, with almost every volunteer already assigned to an inidual, more support is likely to be needed in the weeks ahead.The idea has been well received by those who live in the Stenhousemuir and Larbert areas and beyond, so much so organisers opted to branch out and ease the strain on mums and dads by collecting and distributing school lunches purchased by Larbert High School to youngsters stuck at home.Pupils from Larbert High and its cluster primaries are benefitting from the move.On just one day last month, volunteers delivered more than  meals to schoolchildren.Stenny chairman Iain McMenemy, who helped to organise the initiative, said: “We put out a few requests for further volunteers and the response to each has been really encouraging.“We’re doing one-to-one tasks for people like dog walking and shopping and we’re putting in calls to make sure they’re okay.“The advice was clear:you’re going out for your own shopping,you have to go to work,you’re going out for one bit of exercise oryou’re helping a vulnerable person you’re able to go out, particularly because some people have got nobody .“We have even had members of family from farther afield saying they have a relative in the area and they want to give you a call.“We’re still looking for volunteers as we’re only in week three and the smart money is probably on this being extended for three months. We’ve also expanded out to do school meal deliveries for a number of the schools. Carron Bathrooms got in touch and offered two vans so we now have three. On top of that, we’re doing deliveries for Falkirk Foodbank.”Though Stenny officials admitted concerns over the impact COVID- would have on the club itself, their focus has always been on the “health and well-being” of the community.When the community help initiative was first announced, Mr McMenemy wrote in a statement: “With the continuing spread of the coronavirus, Scottish football faces an uncertain future.“It is quite clear that there will be a signicant impact on football operations and finances and Stenhousemuir Football Club will no doubt be affected by this.“However, there are other, more important matters to think about. The coronavirus is a very serious disease that will affect thousands within our communities.“The health and well-being of friends, neighbours and members of our community should be our top priority.”CASE STUDYHARRY RAGLESSSTAR MAN: Steve in his dramatic outfit.A BOY with spina bida and his father are both doing their bit for the community # but in completely dferent ways.Harry Ragless usually spends  per cent of his time in a wheelchair due to his condition, which means his spine did not form properly in the womb and he has neurological damage to his legs and back and cannot feel his feet.But inspired by the efforts of -year-old war veteran Captain Tom Moore, which have seen him raise around £million for the NHS, Harry decided to raise money by walking with his frame and leg supports.The determined six-year-old from Oaksheath Gardens in Durrington, near Worthing, has raised £, and rising within days of his parents launching a fundraising page for his efforts # smashing his £ target.He said: “I feel really good. I was shocked.”His proud mother Selina Ragless said: “He has shocked us all. Because of his condition he tires easily but the other day he walked from our house to Vancouver Road, which is really far for him. We couldn’t believe it.”As word of his exploits spread, Selina said people were coming out of their homes to applaud Harry, who attends West Park School in Marlborough Road, Goring, when he went out for a walk.She said: “I feel overwhelmed to be honest. We owe the NHS so much they have been there for him since he was born and will be there for him for the rest of his le. If we can give something back, that is all we want.”In fact, Harry’s exploits grabbed the attention of Captain Tom himself # and his picture was featured on the Second World War veteran’s Instagram page.Harry is not the only person in his family who is raising a smile in the community.By day, his dad Steve is a warehouse manager # but during his daily walk, he dons his Stars Wars outfit to bring a bit of fun to the neighbourhood. The -year-old said: “I love it. From my own experience, I remember the first Comic-Con I went to in Birmingham and I saw all these stormtroopers standing outside, and I went into full fanboy mode.”The opportunity for him to get his own suit arose when a friend was selling theirs.He said: “When I finally put it on, I just felt amazing in it. I love seeing the looks and smiles, and people tooting their car horns and waving. It brings a few smiles in these very strange times.”Selina came up with the idea for him to wear it after they were put in lockdown, and during their walks around the estate Steve has posed for ‘socially-distant’ photos with some of the children who have come out to see him.In his spare time, Steve has donned the costume to a iety of events, including birthday parties, weddings and charity events.When the Connaught Cinema has done showings of Star Wars films, Steve has turned up in his gear to raise money for Sussex Association for Spina Bida and Hydrocephalus, a charity which has helped Harry.When askedthere was anything he wanted to say to the people who have donated so far to his campaign, Harry said: “Thank you.”To donate, visit justgiving. com fundraising selina-ragless.Nominate a community heroDo YOU know a volunteer who deserves to be recognised for making a change in their community The Prime Minister recognises one person a day with a Point of Light award.Read more or nominate someone at www.pointsoflight.gov.uk "},{"url":null,"title":"sad ending for ardfern","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsPuffer enthusiast and reader David Wright, who grew up in Bellanoch and now lives in Largs, sent in this photograph of the #Ardfern# puffer taken in the early s.Ardfern sank entering the canal locks at Crinan.

outbreak.It is estimated that the public is collectively owed about pound billion from travel firms.Forced instead to turn to their banks for help, many customers have now been told they are not eligible for a refund.Heres what you need to know.Why arenrsquot travel firms giving refunds Consumer watchdog Which  recently revealed that  of the UKrsquos largest airlines and travel firms are illegally withholding refunds which should be paid to customers within  days.Instead, most customers have been offered vouchers or credit notes, with many complaining that they have been unable to claim a refund online, or get through to customer services on the phone to ask for their money back.Should I ask my bank for a refund Customers who have been refused a refund by travel firms and paid for their trip using a credit card can claim the money back from their provider under Section  of the Consumer Rights Act.Credit card providers are jointly liable with the retailer or trader for any breach of contract for misrepresentation, providing the value is more than pound and less than pound,.However, Which  has warned that some credit card customers have been told by their provider that theyre not eligible for a refund through the scheme.Others have been informed that their claim wonrsquot be processed until they have tried to claim the cash from the travel firm first, even though this is not a legal requirement.Customers are also able to claim through a process known as chargeback, which allows a transaction to be reversedyou are unable to resolve a dispute, including services not delivered.This covers all card payments and is a process agreed between financial institutions and the relevant card scheme, such as Mastercard and Visa.What are Mastercard and Visarsquos chargeback rights Mastercard said there is a chargeback right where firms have cancelled goods or services, even where this is due to government restrictions, insolvency or other exceptional circumstances.It is also validthe cardholder doesnrsquot wish to accept the firmrsquos offer to rebook or claim a voucher, but the issue should first be attempted to be resolved with the firm.Visarsquos guidance also states that firms should process a refund promptlycustomers decline a credit note or voucher, and cardholders do have a right to complain when goods or services are not provided.However, Visa does make an exception where firms have failed to provide a service due to a government-imposed travel ban, stating that this ldquosupersedes Visa rules on dispute rights.For this reason, Mastercard customers are likely to be more successful when making chargeback claims for coronavirus-related cancellations.If flights are cancelled due to closed borders, customers will still have a dispute right under both Mastercard and Visa, as EU-wide rules around refunds override the government travel ban, according to Which .Which banks will refund under Section  and chargeback Banks have said that they will assess each case inidually when it comes to refunds from firms only offering credit notes or rebooking a cancelled trip.This is what the major banks told Which  about issuing refunds:Where a provider has not met their legal obligations to the customer, Barclays will consider both chargeback and Section  claims, provided the relevant criteria are met.HSBC, including First Directand MS Bank, will allow a chargeback or Section  claim to be made for goods or services not received, but customers are encouraged to contact their airline first.Lloyds Group, including Halaxand Bank of Scotlandsay thata refund is not offered by the travel firm and a customer has proof of this, the bank can pursue a disputed transaction claim under scheme rules.Bankrsquos position is that every chargeback and dispute is dferent, and each claim will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis with the customer to work out the best solution.Nationwidealso says each case will be looked at on a case-by-case basis because it depends on the type of good services being purchased and what the terms of the agreement are with the merchant.Similarly, RBS, including Natwestand Ulster Bank, said cases would be considered on an inidual basis.If a claim made with the merchant in the first instance is not satisfactory, customers can contact Santanderto raise a claim.,params: .pushWhere the merchant has offered the chance to rebook for free and or provide vouchers and the customer is not satisfied with this then Starling Banksays it would initiate a chargeback.If a merchant is not offering a refund, or are asking customers to contact their card issuers to process a refund, Tesco Bankcustomers can raise a dispute.The Co-operative Banksays thatcustomers tried to resolve the issue with the merchant first but there was no refund or resolution, the bank would look at each case inidually to verya dispute chargeback right existed. If a chargeback right existed but the cardholder accepted a credit voucher, this would not affect the cardholderrsquos original dispute rights. The bank would also not reject a Section  claim outright in these circumstances.If customers are offered a voucher or a chance to rebook, TSBwould typically accept the claims and each case will be considered inidually.If the customer is unhappy with the solution offered by the merchant, Virgin Moneywould consider the terms and conditions. If the alternative arrangements are not covered, a chargeback would normally be successful.

A report is expected by mid-May.Pub chain Wetherspoonrsquos has said it plans to reopen its bars and hotels in June and said that due to it having larger than average pubs social distancing measures could be applied.RetailMinisters are thought to be considering allowing some non-essential businesses to open, such as garden centres and car showrooms, provided social-distancing could be maintained.Lobby group the British Retail Consortium has produced guidelines on how stores could prepare for the easing of restrictions.The guidance draws on lessons learned from supermarkets in recent weeks to ensure the re-opening of non-essential firms can be done safely.Advice coverslimiting entry and exit points, using floor markings to outline social distancing and keeping changing rooms closed.The guidance also suggests installing cleaning stations with hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes at the front of stores.SportIt is understood Culture Secretary Olive Dowden has been working on a plan for major sports to be played behind closed doors when some social-distancing rules are eased.Weekly meetings are to be held between the Government, Public Health England and medical officials from sports bodies, with the issue due to be on the table when ministers review current measures next month.Key questions that need to be tackled include testing requirements, burdens on emergency services and the possible impact on fan behaviour ndash such as impromptu gatherings outside grounds.Sporting bodies are understood to be keen to resume full training safely as soon as possible.TravelLast week, low-cost European carrier Wizz Air announced plans to resume some flights from Luton Airport on May .Cabin crew will be required to wear masks and gloves on all flights and will distribute sanitising wipes for passengers, while new distancing measures will also be introduced during boarding.Mr Raab has indicated that officials are looking at possible checks at air and sea ports, with passengers arriving in the UK required to quarantine for  days.Meanwhile, the Rail, Maritime and Transportunion warned there was ldquozero chance of ramping up transport services soon, amid speculation of an increase on May  or May  when a new rail timetable is due.Last week, industry sources said no dates have yet been agreed or announced."},{"url":null,"title":"community-resilience-can-turn-help","story":"From collecting shopping and vital prescriptions to dog walking and simply being there for people, the volunteers are there for residents throughout the coronavirus crisis.Here, we look at five of the groups who are giving up their own time to help out.Cockenzie and Port SetonTHE resilience effort in Cockenzie and Port Seton has been helping launch a Fair Share hub at the Port Seton Centre this past week.The charity Fair Share delivers surplus food from supermarkets to the centre every Friday.The hub will cover the whole of East Lothian and support the centrersquos existing work to provide hot meals and food packs to families in need and children who would usually receive free school meals.Bryan Hickman, chairman of the local community council, which is leading the resilience effort, said: ldquoWe are still delivering food to those who need it but the Fair Share hub has been set up.ldquoWe receive food like coffee, cereal, milk and biscuits but this could change every week.ldquoItrsquos really good news that we have set this up as it will help us give other types of food.

Isle of Barra ndash the famous beach landing is one of my favourite travel experiences ever, and you wonrsquot find better fish curry and scallop pakora than at Cafeacute Kisimul. When I first saw the beaches on Vatersay, I couldnrsquot believe I was still in Scotland! Cullen ndash this picturesque seaside town is as charming as they come, from the cute harbour and fishermanrsquos cottages to the iconic arches of the old viaduct. I love walking along the coast to pretty Findochty or to the ruins of Findlater Castle. Isle of Eigg ndash you wonrsquot find friendlier locals than on this community-owned gem of an island. My best memories are climbing An Sgurr and walking up in Cleadale Bothy to views of the Singing Sands and the Jurassic-like Isle of Rum. Ardnamurchan ndash truly wild and untouched, this remote peninsula is the perfect place to just get away from it all. Sanna Bay is a sight to behold, and you can go inside Ardnamurchan Lighthouse at the most westerly point on the British mainland. Isle of Iona ndash possibly the most beautul and peaceful place on Earth. I love visiting the ancient abbey, climbing Dun I for views across the island, or taking a trip to Staffa to see the puffins. Oh, and dinner at Argyll Hotel is something special! Glen Coe ndash I challenge you to find a more dramatic and atmospheric place in Scotland. Glen Coe looks good in all weathers, at any time of year. Glencoe Lochan is a favourite spot on mine, then itrsquos off to the historic Clachaig Inn for a hearty meal and a few drams. Shetland ndash these rugged islands are the most northerly in Scotland closer to Scandinavia than the Scottish mainland. For a lesson in the history and culture, explore the well-preserved ruins at Jarlshof or join the crazy Viking celebrations at Up Helly Aa. Easdale Island ndash push a button in a wee shed to summon the motor boat lsquoferryrsquo over to this tiny island. There are no cars, so wheelbarrows are used to transport supplies, and the flooded slate quarries are local swimming pools.

But now they are having to make do with virtual hugs until such times when restrictions are eased and they can be reunited with loved ones.Before lockdown the online meeting service Zoom may have been used by some, but it has become one of the buzz words over the past few weeks as people try to connect and engage with families virtually.With day centres and activity centres closed during lockdown, some groups have been trying to keep members in touch through Zoom sessions. At one centre run by the Erskine veterans charity pensioners in their s have been getting to grips with Zoom meetings.Debra Dickson, manager of Erskine Reid Macewen Activities Centre, said: ldquoWe have established an online Zoom community where our members can meet and continue to socialise with those who met on a regular basis at the centre. The community includes some much-needed banter, relevant updates and ends with a wonderful mindfulness journey of relaxation and positive thinking with our therapist.

Irsquove been used to regular contact with all the family and itrsquos hard to get used to them being so close yet out of reach.ldquoMeeting up by Zoom has added a welcome dimension to our strange new existence and the possibilities are still developing. We celebrated my birthday with all the children and grandchildren singing and blowing out candles on cakes in their own houses. The downside was that I couldnrsquot taste their magnicent baking efforts.Mrs Mollison has been thinking of new ways to entertain the children on Zoom including reading bedtime stories.She added: ldquoReading stories to the younger grandchildren isnrsquot the same as cuddling up on the sofa with them but a good second best. Taking the librariesrsquo Bookbug sessions as my role model, Irsquove chosen stories with strong pictures and not too many words. But better than this has been listening to my five-year-old grandson, Theo, reading his school stories to me. If parents want half an hour of peace and quiet to get on with something , itrsquos no hardship to sign me up for a session with one of the grandchildren.ldquoAs a gardening enthusiast, Irsquove got used to being asked horticultural questions in person. These days, we can examine pot plants, sow seeds, try to identy emerging seedlings and even take the laptop into the garden.

Older people are adapting to and embracing technology to stay connected to their loved ones in a way they didnrsquot before.We have heard of older people using Zoom to chat to family and friends, community groups coming together on a WhatsApp video chat and grandparents reading bedtime stories to their grandchildren over Skype.Read more: Coronavirus: Postcards bring leline and cheerIrsquove also heard that \"virtual Sunday lunch\" with the family, wherever they are, might become a mainstay for some, even on the other side of the pandemic.Using technology to stay in touch is of particular benefit to the many thousands of older people who are self-isolating and live alone. Technology allows them to interact with others, to see their loved ones faces. Telephone calls, emails and letters are great, but nothing beats being able to see a relativersquos smile and hear them laugh.Of course not everyone had technology in their home when lockdown began. But a number of organisations sprang into action to deliver smartphones and tablets to older people in their own or in care homes. Scottish Care, which represents the independent care sector in Scotland, has been working to get more tablets into care homes, at a time when families are unable to visit their relatives.Read more: Coronavirus in Scotland: What you need to know about keeping mountain ready in lockdownOther charities, including AbilityNet, are assisting older people to understand and make the most of the technology they have to ease any feelings of isolation and loneliness.Before this crisis hit, we knew that chronic loneliness was having a detrimental effect on the lives of many older people. Our research found that , older people in Scotland ate their Christmas dinner alone and , could go at least half a week without hearing from or seeing anyone. Thatrsquos the equivalent of two people on every street in Scotland.Loneliness is a public health epidemic. It is as bad for a personrsquos health as smoking  cigarettes a day. It contributes to high blood pressure, heart disease, depression and increases the chance of an early death by %.The current situation will have intensied this problem with older people, who are also at greatest risk from coronavirus, feeling more isolated and lonely than ever. It is vitally important that we look for ways for them to feel connected to their family, friends and community.However, there are challenges when it comes to technology. Around , over-s in Scotland ndash the equivalent to the population of Edinburgh ndash do not have access to the internet. FaceTime and Zoom are not available to them. These people must not be left behind. We would encourage anyone feels alone to call our free Helpline on     for a friendly chat.The cost of technology is also an issue for many older people. Those on low incomes are less likely to have internet-enabled technology in their homes. There are , pensioners in Scotland living in poverty and many wonrsquot have technology, let alone high-speed broadband or data connection to the internet.Itrsquos the same with smartphones. Their use among the over-s is incredibly low, with some figures suggesting just one in five has one in their pocket.Right now none of us knows how long the Covid- pandemic will continue to affect our lives. But we do know how important it is for older people to know they are not forgotten. Affordable technology can help with that.Of course itrsquos not the same as seeing family and friends in person. But by using technology, older people are showing a willingness to adapt to very dficult circumstances. Perhaps, with the help of a younger digitally-native relative, they are learning new, le-enhancing skills that will serve them well now and in the future.Brian Sloan is chief executive of Age Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"mysteries-history-can-identify-forgotten-photos","story":"Some might be the streets we grew up in, country houses passed on the road to somewhere , crumbling factories where parents once worked or churches where grandparents worshipped.Captured in black and white, and with many showing streets remarkably clear of the traffic that would soon come, some , fascinating photographs of Scottish le taken during the s and s have presented Scots with the ultimate lockdown puzzle.Images taken by staff working for the long-defunct Scottish Development Department have been made available online for the first time by Historic Environment Scotland , along with an appeal to the public to turn detective and help identy the houses, streets and businesses they show.They may have their work cut out: the new online archive showcases rural and urban Scotland, from Highland crofts and Orkney farms to large housing estates in Fe, city tenements in Glasgow, unidentied town centre shops with old-fashioned signs and equally old-fashioned looking shoppers.While some may be easy to locate, others are likely to have viewers scratching their heads over where they may be.As well as providing Scots with a massive puzzle to solve, the collection of images offers a rare insight into what le was like throughout Scotland in years not that long gone by, with pub interiors, fashion trends and interior design choices also captured.One of the most striking elements of the outdoor photographs is the lack of vehicles travelling on Scottish roads, while others capture everyday elements of le which were familiar at the time but are now long gone ndash such as one image showing firemen dressed in their yellow waterproofs, shoppers queuing outside their local fishmonger, and children playing in the street on their Chopper bikes.Lesley Ferguson, head of archives at HES, said: ldquoPeople will find this collection really engaging. Sometimes history can be too far away, whereas this is history that people will remember.ldquoSome show buildings and others are just street scenes taken at a time when there were far fewer cars on the road.ldquoUnfortunately, we donrsquot know where some of these historic photographs were taken and thatrsquos why we are asking for the publicrsquos help.While the images have been digitised and uploaded to Canmore, the online catalogue of HES archives, it was felt it would be too time-consuming for HES staff to st through the , unidentied images in an effort to find their location.Instead itrsquos hoped that visitors to the Canmore website will come to the rescue and email details of locations and buildings to HES staff. The images will be alternated regularly to allow more photographs to be catalogued.The unidentied images are among around , plastic photographic negatives and some printed photographs contained within the HES Scottish Development Department collection, most of which contain information regarding the location where they were taken.Some relate to the development of Scotlandrsquos New Towns, while others show buildings in a state of disrepair and may be among the last photographs prior to the buildings being lost forever.Last year alone, over , items from the HES archives were digitised, among them prints relating to signicant archaeological digs and images of excavations at historic sites such as Skara Brae in Orkney and Edinburgh Castle.They included approximately , prints digitised from personal research and work by prominent archaeologists such as Dr Euan Mackie, Roger Mercer and Vere Gordon Childe, with the oldest image dating from around .Mackiersquos collection comprises field notes, photographs, drawings and ious research material collected during investigations of threatened sites including East Wemyss Caves and the Greenland, Auchentorlie prehistoric rock sculptures.Much of the collection derives from his s excavation and survey of brochs and duns, notably Dun Mor Vaul in Tiree, Dun Lagaidh, and Dun an Ruigh Ruadh in Lochbroom.Over one million archives documenting Scotlandrsquos archaeological sites, buildings, industry and maritime heritage are currently available on Canmore.Ferguson added: ldquoThese archives give a unique perspective on civic planning in the th century including the development and growth of Scotlandrsquos New Towns, while the images of excavations showcase the sites that helped archaeologists unlock the secrets of Scotlandrsquos past ndash from the Neolithic to the Middle Ages.ldquoBy digitising our archives, wersquore able to make them available to even more people.

Even a brief flutter would have marked some appreciation of the decisive part the Red Army played, the casualties they and the civilian population took, turning the tide of the war and sparing us the onslaught.In June , Hitler launched Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of Russia and its satellites, with its prime target the capture of Moscow, domination and total victory. Around the time Vera Lynn recorded the song,  months later, the Wehrmacht had been turned back less than  miles from Moscow.There is a memorial which marks the spot the German retreat began, giant tank traps, now surrounded by shops and arterial roads, where in April  the second great historical retreat from Moscow began.In the  months of the initial blitzkrieg the Axis armies had destroyed almost all of the Soviet Air Force on the ground as well as entire armies. Ukraine fell and as Russian soldiers tried to stem the advance, whole factories were uprooted and moved eastwards to prevent them falling into enemy hands.In September , after a bitter and bloody -day siege, Ukrainersquos capital Kiev fell.

The Germans couldnrsquot accept defeat from ldquoinferiors, so they arranged amatch, stfened by several new recruits to the team.At half-time it was - to Start. A German officer burst into the ramshackle dressing room to tell the players that ldquoonly Germans can win today, making the threat explicit.It made no dference. Start ran out - winners in what became known as The Death Match.Start were to play only once more, winning - a week later. Two days after that the Gestapo arrested six of their players in the bakery and  hours later another two were arrested.Four Dynamo players were executed by the Germans, three of them together in a line as they took the bullets. In , a monument to the four was put up in the grounds of Dynamorsquos old stadium, their faces chiselled into marble.The war on the Eastern Front, in what the Russians call The Great Patriotic War, did not end with the retreat from Moscow, but with the final Nazi capitulation ndash also on VE Day, May , .In the wider war for the conquest of Russia the numbers employed and the losses are chilling, almost unimaginable. The largest invasion force in the history of warfare, the largest military operation and some of the heaviest and bloodies battles of the war, its casualties make those atomised in Hiroshima and Nagasaki seem almost incidental.The most famous battle, even over that of Moscow, is the monumental one for Stalingrad, now Volograd. It ranks as the greatest battle of the entire war. It lasted from July  to February  and marked the turning of it for the Allies.When the Red Army finally broke back and crushed the German infantry they recovered , German and Romanian corpses, although the total death toll is believed to exceed ,. Red Army casualties ndash dead, wounded, missing or captured ndash numbered more than a million. Lives, not just figures.The historic capital of Russia, St Petersburg, then renamed Leningrad, was besieged for  days, from September  to January . The blockade claimed the lives of , Leningraders in  alone, mostly from starvation and disease.The novelist Helen Dunmore wrote a remarkable and beautul epic novel, The Siege, a love story set in a battle for survival, where the corpses froze in the street, some were cannibalised, and people were so hungry they boiled shoe leather for soup and burned furniture to keep warm and barely alive.Over The Great Patriotic War five million Red Army soldiers were captured, the majority of whom never went home, with more than three million either shot or starved to death by the Nazis. Mass shootings and gassings, aided by collaborators, also murdered over a million Soviet Jews. Gang rape and subsequent murders went unreported.The figures of catastrophe are barely credible. More died in the four years of the Eastern Front than in all other combat across the globe in all of the Second World War.The Red Army losses were . million soldiers, while more than  million Soviet civilians also perished. Destruction was also monumental, with , towns and , villages razed. Of the  million German soldiers who fought on the front, . million died. The story of the Russian suffering and their eventual triumph, which was crucial in keeping us free and speaking the language we hold so dear, has been largely obscured by what Churchill described as the Iron Curtain which descended across Europe, and which also blotted out the purges of Stalin, in the Cold War.Recognising that, waving a flag for them, shouldnrsquot ide us ndash although it appears to ndash on this of all weekends."},{"url":null,"title":"whisky-tourism-can-key-scotlands-post-coronavirus-bounce-back-says-festival-chairman","story":"By James CampbellWhen we wrapped our phenomenally successful Spirit of Speyside Festival  with plans in place for an even bigger and better collection of events in , we never could have imagined we would be where we are today. The festival has been cancelled and cultural gatherings across the country have been put on hold or postponed.It goes without saying that in these times our priority is the health and safety of our families, our loved ones ndash whether thatrsquos hugs with grandchildren, seeing friends or enjoying shared experiences such as the Spirit of Speyside Festival which should have been held last week. However, what I have witnessed emerging is hope, resilience and a strong Scottish can-do attitude. In the whisky industry, in particular, within days of lockdown being announced, distilleries rallied together to manufacture large quantities of vitally important hand sanitiser.Itrsquos a true testament to our Scottish fighting spirit that we will not take this lying down. We adapt and move forward as best we can. Irsquom extremely proud of the Speyside community and our wider Spirit of Speyside Festival family across the world for keeping the spirit of the festival alive.Whisky and tourism are pivotal sectors to the Scottish economy. Three out of every five tourists come to Speyside for whisky tourism. In fact, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary event last year. The Spirit of Speyside Whisky Festival has become an iconic event on the international whisky calendar, appealing to both the whisky curious and connoisseurs in a region that has become one of the fastest-growing tourist destinations in the UK.As well as being home to the highest concentration of distilleries of all whisky regions in the world, Speyside also produces the largest volume of whisky, as well as an increasingly wide range of spirits ndash we are now home to  dferent gin companies.This is why we introduced our Speyside Gin Festival in June, to create a new weekend for both locals and visitors to enjoy, then we celebrate all our great Speyside whisky companies and local gin and craft beer companies at our Distilled Festival, all under one roof in Elgin, normally at the end of August.This yearrsquos Gin Festival has sadly been cancelled and a decision is yet to be made about Distilled. However, based on current guidance, we feel itrsquos unlikely it will go ahead.But the appetite for whisky is there and it will remain. I am confident our economy will be rebuilt and we will work hard to do this together. According to VisitScotland, the Spirit of Speyside Festival welcomed visitors from  dferent countries to its th anniversary festival last year. This is a sector that is worth pound million to the regionrsquos economy. When we emerge from the other side of the pandemic Irsquom certain these figures will only increase.International travel is sure to take a downturn in the short term, while people look for local and regional travel opportunities on their doorstep. Domestic travel is set to be the first to bounce back when restrictions are eased, and I canrsquot wait to welcome tourists from all over the UK to beautul Speyside.Our Team Speyside approach to tourism will pull us through these tough times in our part of the world, of that I have no doubt. Our whisky distilleries will reopen, glasses will be raised to good health, and visitors from across the world will once again immerse themselves in Malt Whisky Country. Never will the term ldquoslaacuteinte mhaith hold more weight than it will when this is all over.

However, export licences had not been obtained by the Government.The planes lay on the tarmac while negotiations took place, but the disaster was magnied when the , gowns eventually arrived back in the UK only to be impounded at Heathrow as they were ldquouseless.It emerged the private firm making them had switched from its usual production of T-shirts and tracksuits, and the items it had produced did not meet safety standards.Other issues around PPE included health boards and trusts across the country competing with one another for supplies, and purchasing of PPE was left so late that prices had soared, costing governments more to procure it.On testing, the World Health Organisationrsquos pandemic advice has been to use existing primary healthcare systems, such as GP surgeries and hospitals in the first instance.But many countries ignored this and built parallel systems instead, such as the UKrsquos testing hubs and drive-through sites, or the Nightingale hospitals and Glasgowrsquos Louisa Jordan.As a result, many hospital departments and GP surgeries have seen fewer patients than they would normally.The issues around testing became apparent when Health Secretary Matt Hancock set a goal of carrying out , tests for Covid- per day by the end of April, but with less than a week to go before the deadline, the Government had failed to conduct even half that number.Hancock said the ldquodemand had simply not been high enough, when in fact there were reports that workers were being offered tests in places hours away from where they lived, making it impossible for them to get there.Eventually the Government introduced mobile testing sites ndash vehicles which would go to areas furthest from the central testing sites ndash making it easier to access those who needed tests.According to experts,the testing hubs had been set up in communities in the first place, as set out in the World Health Organisations advice, there may not have been so many problems."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11355172.jpg?type=article-full","title":"coronavirus-scotland-actual-tests-one-third-capacity-new-figures-show","story":"Official figures show that over the week since the Scottish Government announced it had met its self-imposed target over the ability to test, it was carrying out an average of , tests a day in hospitals, care homes or the community.Meanwhile, the nation had the ability to carry out more than  tests a day in NHS labs and a further  at the Lighthouse Laboratory in Glasgow.It comes as Hugh Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen University, warned the Scottish Government that testing capacity, turnaround times and the ability to test locally has to be up to speed for test, trace and isolate to work.He said he could \"see no reason\" why any laboratory conducting the Covid- RT-PCR tests \"could not signicantly increase\" testing capacity.The Scottish Government came under fire earlier this week after public health professor Linda Bauld warned there was a ldquobig problem with the test, trace, isolate strategy ndash with the turnaround for test results currently averaging  hours. Other countries are doing it in four hours.:Scotland nowhere near prepared enough to handle mass vaccination against Covid-, expert warnsIn his latest observations to ministers, Mr Pennington says it has been \"well known for many years\" that care homes provide an environment which facilitates the spread of a range of microbial pathogens and that \"frequent and repeated testing\" of those going into them \"is the only preventive measure that will be signicantly effective\".Concerns have also been raised about the ability to test frontline workers in Scotland during the Covid- crisis.The Scottish Government is reviewing its Covid- testing strategy after the Deputy First Minster John Swinney was left ldquofrustrated by reports home care workers had been told to travel to the other side of Scotland for tests.Nicola Sturgeon said that by Friday, the NHS capacity to test was to rise to -a-day ndash meaning Scotland would have the ability to carry out , tests a day ndash on top of the UK-organised drive-throughs.On April , the First Minister set out an aim to \"proportionately\" match with % of the ,-tests-a-day pledge by the UK health secretary Matt Hancock. Data shows that both the Scotland and the rest of the UK have been failing to meet that aim in the past week.The Scottish Government had been preparing to have the ability to test ndash referred to officially as \"capacity\" ndash in Scotlands laboratories to rise to more than , daily by the end of the month.On May , the First Minister said the ability to test had actually exceeded that and had risen to  tests a day with NHS laboratories operating in all health board areas, without relying on the Lighthouse lab.She announced testing in care homes in Scotland will include testing of all residents and staff ndash whether or not they have the virus ndash in homes where there has been a confirmed case.But she admitted: \"Laboratory capacity is one thing, what matters is the volume of testing we do and the clinical objectives we set for testing.\"Herald on Sunday analysis of Scotlands new way of reporting of testing launched on May  reveals that Scotland has been consistently lagging way behind the rest of the UK in terms of its per-capita testing rate.On Friday alone Scotland was completing  tests per million of population - % less than the  per million of population for the whole of the UK.Official Scottish Government figures show that  tests were carried out on Friday, with a further , completed at regional drive-through centres organised by the UK government, which provides extra capacity for checks. The  tests carried out was a drop of  on the previous  hours and  less than the weeks peak of , on the day the First Minister announced the new testing aims.Testing for coronavirus is seen as a crucial factor to easing out of lockdown ndash allowing the country to effectively isolate cases and their contacts to contain any spread.Both the UK and Scottish governments have been coming under fire for unpreparedness and a failure in mass testing in the current coronavirus pandemic.Mr Pennington emphasised the importance of wider testing in his latest observations.He said: \"Mass community testing will be needed to identy infectious but asymptomatic iniduals as part of the contact tracing process. When new case numbers have signicantly declined and when it is evident that the decline is being sustained for several days, it should be possible to start contact tracing to hunt down the virus.\"Professor Bauld echoed the need for community testing in evidence given to MSPs last week.\"We look like we are getting it right on hospitals... we have limited information from high-risk settings so thats care homes and other settings where you have vulnerable populations who particularly urgently need tested and staff need testing. As far as I am aware we dont have data, and have not yet got the capacity in primary care and out-of-hours settings,\" she said.:Ian Blackford hits out at familys -mile holiday to Motherwell as Scots poke fun at bizarre trip\"If we are going to have a mass testing programme, which we need to do for test, trace,isolate, we need real time data from those settings so we can figure out what is going on. My understanding is Wales are a step ahead of us in time of these real time data issues.\"Sir Harry Burns, the former Chief Medical Officer for Scotland, meanwhile, warned that we have \"a long way to go on test, trace and isolate at this time\" ndash pointing to worries about the quality of tests as well as the number.He pointed to South Korea as an example of a country which is \"far more aggressive\" in terms of identying people who might spread it adding: \"And thats why the testing is important.\"South Korea has suffered just  coronvirus fatalities from a population of . million while Scotland has seven times that death toll with about a tenth of the people.\"Test people to see who is capable of spreading it, trace the contacts and isolate all their contacts, as well as them,\" he said. \"That is the way in which you control any infectious disease.\"He added: \"We should be testing the whole population. We need to know how widespread the virus is in the population, once you know that, you know who might still be out there that might be infected.\"We need to be looking at the folk capable of spreading it and those are predominantly health and care workers, and we need to be testing them on a regular basis.\"The Scottish Government said it was signicantly scaling up its testing capacity.A spokesman said \"We now have overall NHS lab capacity of , tests a day.

You cannot furlough a dairy cow. The costs of feeding and milking continue regardless. In other sectors you can put production into hibernation until the markets re-open. You can#t do that for dairy products.#He continued: “The farming minister has just announced new funding to support dairy farmers in England due to the current crisis. I hope that all authorities will act where they can to mitigate the impact. There are roles here for the UK and Scottish Governments and for our local councils. They all need to step up to the plate.“Dairy farmers in Orkney worked hard to establish a brand recognised as being a high-quality product.  If we do not support them during these challenging times then we risk that work being wasted.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

While guidance to local councils suggested the former, a recent response from the Tourism Secretary, Fergus Ewing to Shetland MSP Beatrice Wishart suggested the latter.Mr McArthur wrote to finance secretary, Kate Forbes, seeking clarity and has been told that  days of bookings are required in order to be able to access support. But Orkney’s MSP has pointed to claims by the Association of Scotland’s Self-Caterersthat requiring  days of bookings unfairly excludes most self-caterers who operate in areas where the tourism season is typically shorter, such as rural and island communities.Mr McArthur said: “Getting the eligibility criteria right for these funding schemes was never going to be easy. The Finance Secretary deserves credit, however, for being willing to make changes based on feedback from myself and MSP colleagues, as well as businesses directly.“However, almost two months into the lockdown, and it is clear that many self-catering businesses in Orkney are still falling through the gaps, despite being able to evidence self-catering as a primary source of income.  This not only threatens the future of these inidual businesses but also potentially Orkney’s wider tourism sector.“The situation has not been helped by contradictions in the advice offered by dferent Ministers. The Finance Secretary has now addressed this confusion over eligibility criteria, but at the same time confirmed the sense that the bar has been set very high for applicants in many rural and island areas.“As the ASSC point out, expecting self-caterers in the islands to be able to evidence almost five months of bookings for their property is often unrealistic given that the tourism season is typically shorter here than in other parts of the country.“I have urged the Finance Secretary to look again at the criteria to ensure that they are properly ‘island proofed’ under the terms of the Islands Act.  While there is a need to avoid making scheme rules overly-complex or confusing, it is also important that they achieve fairness for businesses wherever they happen to be based.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

However, in May  Loch Alsh became a centre of activity for processing German U-boats that had surrendered at the end of the war in Europe.With the objective of ensuring total German naval disarmament, the Royal Navy intended that, at the cessation of hostilities, any German U-boats that surrendered in and around Europe would be moved to the UK prior to their destruction.To this end Admiral Sir Max Horton, Commander-in-Chief Western Approaches, advised the Admiralty that he intended to use Lisahally in Northern Ireland and Loch Ryan in south-west Scotland for laying-up the surrendered U-boats pending joint Allied agreement about their future.’, and on  March  decisions were concentrating on three main strands of action.The first related to the surrender orders to be issued to the U-boats at sea at the time of the expected German capitulation.The second concerned the reception arrangements for the U-boats surrendering from sea, and the third concerned the arrangements for the reception of the U-boats that had surrendered in German and German-controlledports and which were then to be transferred to the UK.Loch Eriboll near Cape Wrath in the far north-west corner of Scotland was designated as a ‘Port for Preliminary Examination’, Loch Alsh on the north-west coast of Scotland, was designated as a ‘Port for Final Examination’ and Lisahally and Loch Ryan were designated as ‘Ports for Laying-Up’.Loch Alsh was selected for the final examinations because it was sheltered, because it could accommodate  U-boats on buoys at any one time, and because it possessed both a resident naval organisation and a railhead.As Loch Ryan did not become operational until after  June, all the U-boats handled in Loch Alsh in May  were destined to be transferred to Lisahally.Loch Alsh’s principal role was to remove the U-boats’ torpedoes, as well as to take the majority of the German crews into captivity, and this was influenced by the fact that it was already a formal, but small naval anchorage.However, although it had a resident Naval Officer-in-Charge, Captain Brian Gourley, who was to be responsible for the overall organisation, it did not have sufficient staff or facilities to process the number of U-boats that were expected to pass through in transit from Loch Eriboll to Lisahally., which was commanded by Commander Bertram W Taylor, was ordered to Loch Alsh to organise this intermediate part of the surrender process,arriving there on  May.In the meantime the general German capitulation came into effect, and this led to the issue of the Admiralty order that all U-boats were to surrender with effect from  hours on  May, and that those still at sea were to head for a number of designated reception ports, the prime one of which was Loch Eriboll.The first U-boat to arrive in Loch Eriboll was U- on the morning of  May and, by  May seventeen more U-boats had arrived in the Loch.None of the U-boats which had surrendered from sea spent long at Loch Eriboll.Instead, after the preliminary examinations, they were moved quickly, and under escort, to Loch Alsh. Escort Groupwhich was based in Loch Eriboll:, which were being moved to Trondheim from Narvik where they had surrendered on  May.Escort Group , but instead of being allowed to continue to Trondheim, the Admiralty directed that the U-boats should be escorted to Loch Eriboll.The  U-boats were therefore escorted across the North Sea to Loch Eriboll by the th EG, and they all arrived off Loch Eriboll at  in the evening of  May where they were met by ships of  EG before moving into the anchorage for initial processing.After that, the ex-Narvik U-boats were quickly transferred to Loch Alsh, sailing in three separate batches of five:, and they were escorted from Loch Eriboll by four ships from  EG on  May. left Loch Eriboll on  May escorted by two ships from  EG and one from the th EG. escorted by three ships from  EG also left Loch Eriboll on  May.It had originally been intended to berth the U-boats singly alongside Loch Alsh’s railway pier where, with the aid of its steam crane, their torpedoes would be disembarked.However, it soon became clear that the rate of arrival of the U-boats from Loch Eriboll, the lack of on-shore accommodation at Loch Alsh and the general shortage of personnel, would result in a very slow turnoverthis plan continued.moored in Loch Alsh awaiting disposal by the Royal Navy.However, these two ships were well suited to the U-boat handling task in every way, particularly as each possessed an electric crane whose lting capabilities were ideal for the task of disembarking torpedoes from the U-boats...The four remaining ships in  EG were employed in providing guards for the U-boats on arrival and for escorting them to Lisahally after they had been processed. arrived from Loch Eriboll, and the final examination process began.This started with the removal of all the German officers and men from each U-boat, except for a steaming party.A Royal Navy submarine inspection party which had been delivered to Loch Alsh on  May then began the formal inspection of each U-boat and, as soon as the torpedo compartments were pronounced clear, the removal of the torpedoes started.Within the first  hours, eight U-boats had been cleared,  torpedoes had been removed, and  German officers and  ratings had been searched and landed as Prisoners-of-War.would be available to be transferred to Lisahally on  May.The prospect of up to eight U-boats being transferred to Lisahally so quickly after the German capitulation provided an ideal opportunity for Admiral Sir Max Horton to stage a public multi-national surrender ceremony to celebrate the successful end of the anti-U-boat war in the North Atlantic.’ which took place on  May.Despite the considerable pressures created by the need for speed, Commander Taylor’s arrangements for the processing of the U-boats at Loch Alsh turned out to be exactlyright in the circumstances, and after clearing the first eight U-boats, the process settled down to run smoothly.Prisoners were cleared every other day, so that there were never more than  men in either depot ship at one time.The later U-boats had few torpedoes, many none at all, so the rate of handling went up to six per day at times. had arrived at Loch Alsh from Loch Eriboll on  May, and aroused considerable interest because of its cargo of strategic materials from the Far East, and it was then sailed for Liverpool on  May.The U-boat arrived in Liverpool on  May for its cargo to be unloaded in the Gladstone Dock. was moved to Barrow-in-Furness on  May for completion of the unloading process.In the meantime, while in Liverpool, the U-boat was inspected by Admiral Horton amid considerable publicity, giving rise to the oft-repeated, but incorrect, story that it had surrendered there.The movement of the remaining U-boats from Loch Alsh to Lisahally went equally smoothly, with the U-boats and their escorts departing regularly:.As warheads were also stored in the lighter, steps had to be taken to keep the fire localised and prevent the heat reaching the explosives.A drter remained alongside all night, prepared to tow the lighter clearnecessary, but the fire was contained and the drama ceased.The fire had occurred in the battery compartment and propelling motor of the torpedo, and was the result of chemical action after acid from the batteries was spilt whist the torpedo was being handled. bound for Lisahally.

It had been designated as the ‘Port for Final Examination’ of the surrendered German U-boats that had arrived earlier at Loch Eriboll, both directly from sea and from Narvik, and thus was involved in the processing of  of the U-boats that were to be held in the UK awaiting decisions about their final demise.Loch Alsh was an established, albeit small, naval base, and it had the advantage of a railhead.

Yesterday UK Environment Secretary George Eustice warned there will be no dramatic overnight change and the government will be very cautious.Wales# First Minister Mark Drakeford announced three modest adjustments from Monday to restrictions there. The Scottish First Minister, meanwhile, hinted there may be a region-by-region approach to easing lockdown.Nicola Sturgeon said there was a helpful recognition in her call with the Prime Minister that the four UK nations may well move at dferent speedsour data about the spread of the virus says that that is necessary to suppress it. Meanwhile, Mrs Foster said it was important to move together as a bloc with the rest of the UK to send a clear and simple message to the population. She said restrictions in Northern Ireland, extended on Thursday, would remain in place for the foreseeable future. But she said it was important to offer some hope to the public. She told BBC Breakfast: There#s a dference between sticking with the restrictions and making nuanced changes. Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseFirst Minister Arlene FosterPhoto by Kelvin Boyes  Press E FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappFirst Minister Arlene FosterDuring those three weeks we can look to seethere are some nuanced changes we can make and I would put going out more for exercise in the open air as a nuanced change rather than a fundamental change. I think those things can be looked at... but what is important is the regulations are put in place for another three weeks. Mrs Foster said she spoke to Mr Johnson on Thursday, and he said he was moving forward with maximum caution. He, and I as well, want us to move forwardwe can in a four-nations way, she said. Because when we do that we have a simplicity of message, we have a clarity of message, and people really understand what#s really going on when we move together as a bloc. Yesterday, on a visit to Dungannon, Ms O#Neill repeated calls for an all-island approach to exiting lockdown.She said the message, for now, remained to stay at home - but indicated plans for a loosening of restrictions would be made public in the coming days.Ms O#Neill added: We said we will publish an exit strategy and it will be here by the start of the week.Every action we take, we won#t know the impact for a few weeks. People want to know in June and July they#ll be able to do #x,y,z# and I want to hopefully be in a position to give that information at the start of the week.Ms O#Neill said that regardless of what Mr Johnson outlines tomorrow, the message here was the same. She added: My message is very clear. Stay at home for the next three weeks. We#re going to have an exit strategy to give us all some hope for the future. We live on an island, We need to work together across the island. It makes good common sense. The disease is spreading across the island at the very same rate. It#s important we work together as best we that we can and we have to recognise the fact hat the disease doesn#t stop at the border.At the daily Downing Street briefing, Mr Eustice said the Prime Minister will set out a road map tomorrow about how the current restrictions can evolve. He said the four nations are all working together to try to have a broadly similar approach.Mr Eustice said the UK is not out of the woods and that the UK will live with the virus for some time to come. He said: We will have to wait for what the Prime Minister has to say on Sunday but I think what I can say is this - he#s going to set out effectively a road map of how we can evolve the current restrictions. We have this complete lockdown at the moment to something where certain activities may become possible in the short-term, in the near term and other things might take much longer. We have to be realistic that there isn#t going to be dramatic overnight change, we will be very, very cautious as we loosen the restrictions we have, as the data we#re outlining on a daily basis shows we are not out of the woods. There are still major challenges, we will be living with this virus for some time to come and it#s therefore important to avoid that second peak that could overwhelm our NHS. He added that all devolved administrations attended Cobra meetings and while each may take slightly dferent approaches they are working together to try to have a broadly similar UK approach.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

At the weekend, the Irish government outlined its roadmap for reopening society and business. The British government is set to publish its plans this Sunday. Speaking at today’s COVID- press conference First Minister Arlene Foster said the NI Executive is working ‘actively’ on its plan and continues to make progress. She said people would be ‘anxious’ to know of NI’s plan but cautioned that social distancing measures are ‘likely to be with us for some time’. The First Minister explained: “In fashioning a plan ministers are being guided by the latest medical and scientic evidence. googletag.cmd.push “We are looking closely at the current rate of infection, the estimated level of transmission, and estimates of future trajectory in this pandemic once relaxation takes place. “Another signicant factor in our planning is assessing the impact on our health and social care system to deal with COVID- cases. “And also of course the resumption of other health services. The Executive is also assessing the wider health, societal and economic implications of the current restrictions to determine which areas will pose the least risk and greatest benefitwe were to relax them. “None of these decisions are easy, as we’ve said before all governments are grappling with the implications of a public health crisis that we never thought would come to pass. googletag.cmd.push “And COVID- has dramatically altered society and will have implications for the way we live for many years to come.” She added that there is a danger of the public becoming distracted and going back to what they did before. The First Minister said the country needs to be on guard and respect social distancing guidelines. She went on to say that people ‘cannot afford to be lax’ and act like coronavirus has been beaten as it still ‘poses a threat to you and those you love’. Restrictions won’t be kept in place any longer than is necessary, she concluded. Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill said any approach must be ‘cautious and gradual’ as COVID- is still spreading and taking lives. She asked the public not to take matters into their own hands. The plan will be published as soon as possible, ‘hopefully later this week’. Any plan is ‘not a green light’ for people to do as they choose as the Executive is looking at the safest possible approach, the Deputy First Minister added. She also took the opportunity to welcome Finance Minister Conor Murphys announcement of over pound million of new funding for infrastructure, regeneration, and tourism projects across the north. That includes match funding of poundm forDerry City and Strabanes City Deal Inclusive Future Fund.

Cllr Kathleen McGurk started the GoFundMe campaign to help those struggling to afford day-to-day essentials, with over pound raised to date. The Causeway Coast and Glens councillor said the generosity from the community had been ‘overwhelming’. “Many in our community will have lost their income, seen businesses collapse and are facing increased living costs from being at home all day,” she said. “Families and others in our community will be struggling to put food on the table and pay their bills. I have been overwhelmed by the generosity from our community to help those in need. googletag.cmd.push “Despite the extensive measures put in place by Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, these are unprecedented times and there will still be many people who require help.” The funds will help people to purchase essentials such as groceries, sanitary items, electricity top ups and coal. Referrals to the scheme can be made to any of the Community Co-ordinators who are involved in the Community Coronavirus Response. The scheme provides support to those who are isolating at home and has tapped into strong community spirit in the area. Cllr McGurk also reiterated the call from the Executive for local residents to stay in their homes and adhere to the guidelines. googletag.cmd.push She said: “It is imperative that everyone continues to observe the social distancing and lockdown guidance issued by the Executive. “Monday saw the highest COVID- death toll here in the North since the beginning of the Pandemic, and we cannot become complacent. “I understand that it is an extraordinary ask of people to stay at home, particularlyyou are struggling financially and this is why I believe all elected representatives should work as hard as possible to alleviate the stress and strain of the lockdown. “I hope that the money I have helped to raise will be able to help some of my constituents with this.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

James O’Donnell frequently takes photos of his beloved dog ‘Iggy’ in some of the most spectacular locations around the county. And she is now becoming a bit of a celebrity with thousands of people all over the world going online to see the Border Collie with stunning Donegal backdrops behind her. In one week recently, Iggy-related photos reached over a quarter of a million people on facebook. Falcarragh-based James has been building up a collection of photos with nine-year-old Iggy, and his work has attracted a lot of attention. googletag.cmd.push Indeed, in March, he had been scheduled to go to America for a number of exhibitions, starting in Florida. But the onset of Covid- meant the flights had to be cancelled. Nevertheless, he is hoping to go to New York later in the summer for another exhibition and possibly also to Connecticut. His talent is such that his work has attracted the attention of highly regarded veteran Magnum Photos member Elliott Erwittand Samuel Holmes , and through them steps were put in place for the planned exhibitions. The fact that they have been in contact highlights just what an impact James is making. googletag.cmd.push After World War II, a number of photographers banded together to form Magnum Photos, an organisation dedicated to chronicling world events - and named for the magnum-sized bottle of wine that they drank at each meeting! The process of becoming a full member of Magnum Photos takes a minimum of four years. Photographers are only considered once a year, during Magnums Annual General Meeting in June, where one day is set aside for considering and voting on potential new members portfolios. It is highly prestigious. “I love promoting Donegal,” James said, pointing out that he actually takes all his photos on his mobile phone! James lived in London for many years, before ing home to Donegal, and he adores the outside world and doing his bit to showcase and promote the county in any way that he can. Last year he produced a calendar called “Iggy’s Donegal” - filled with fine pictures from ramblings and hikes around Donegal - and it proved to be very popular. Recently a photo taken by James attracted the attention of BBC Northern Ireland weather forecaster Barra Best. Best tweeted the photo and commented that it was a “great example” of “an extremely rare phenomenon” known as Kelvin-Helmholtz clouds. The stunning imageof the cloud formation was taken from the Back Strand in Falcarragh, and needless to say, also featured Iggy. All the indications are that Iggy is on the way to being a great ambassador for Donegal, and while this will be a terribly dficult year for those in the tourism sector here, at least James and Iggy are publicising to the world some of the great sights to see. The story made the front page of this week’s Donegal Post newspaper and is featured in this Thursday’s Donegal Democrat .

His GAA career would earn him an all-star at the age of  in his first season with Derry seniors in . In  of a family, six boys and five girls, football was always the game of choice in the fields around home, with the neighbours joining in to bolster the numbers. googletag.cmd.push From the rural Moneyhaughan Primary School, he moved on to St Patricks and St Brigids in the nearby village of Claudy. Hughie Doherty was on the teaching staff and passed on his fascination with sport. The schools gym was a haven for youngsters after school. Basketball, Gaelic football or soccer. It didnt matter. Indeed, it was often after six oclock before McElhinney ed home. “Hughie was the guy who got me to Dungiven Celtic. I was  at the time and I played in goals for them,” said McElhinney. Derry City had withdrawn from the Irish league and before they became affiliated with the League of Ireland in the s, they operated in the realms of junior football. It wasnt long before McElhinney joined them. He recalls how hard it was to get around at the time during The Troubles, but he always found time for sport. “I wouldve played football seven days a week,” he said. After an outing for Derry City in the morning, Saturday afternoon would revolve around Dungiven Celtic and before he had played for Banagher on Sunday, McElhinney wouldve fitted in a game with Dungivens Sunday morning league team. He was the oldest in the house and it wasnt he until was  that the family home had electricity. The first game he saw televised was the  FA Cup replay. David Webbs injury time winner for Cha over Leeds and a Cha kit received as a present swayed him towards supporting the blues. Performances at the heart of Derry Citys defence brought him to the attention of the other club he supported – Glasgow Celtic. *** Jock Steins right-hand man in the Celtic dug-out was Sligo man Sean Fallon, who scouted players such as Kenny Dalglish and goalkeeper Packie Bonner, Steins last signing as Parkhead boss. “When I played with Derry City, there were some Celtic scouts watching. They were a brilliant club...Sean was assistant manager, but he knew all about Donegal, he had scouts all around there,” McElhinney recalls. They liked what they saw and their  year-old target was invited for trial and was snapped up on a semi-professional arrangement. McElhinney would fit it in around work and was given time off to spend the summer in Glasgow. He played on and off for a season with the clubs reserves. While he was trying keep trim for the boxing back home under Jim Noonans eye in Draperstown, Stein insisted their new signing needed to put on weight. McElhinney was stuck in the middle. “I stayed in a hotel, near Hampden Park, and I used to travel into training every morning. My diet, every other night, was four pints of Guinness in the hotel,” McElhinney joked, having put on a stone and a half. “By the time I came back from Celtic to play for Derry I had went welterweight to middleweight. Arthurhad something to answer, it was very good protein.” Gerry didnt force himself into the first-team at Parkhead, but rubbed shoulders with many future Hoops legends in the reserves side- names like Bobby Lennox, Peter Latchford and George McCluskey. During nearly two hours on the phone, his level of detail is staggering. He never forgets a name. From the Derry players he played with, the soccer battles he had and right down to those he worked for during his summers in America. “A lot of the time, especially in the bad weather, the Celtic first-teamers would playto keep themselves fit,” he continued. At the time, Billy McNeill had left the club. Roddy McDonald was on the books and they brought in Roy Aitken, who would go on to captain the club and win the league and cup double in . McElhinney was surplus to requirements, but his career was far from finished. It was time to head back home, but his career was only beginning. *** Gerry hit the brakes, but nothing happened. The car skidded on the black ice, careered across the road and over the hedge. “Therell be no Castle the night Jim,” Gerry offered, when the car eventually came to a stop. He was referring to the infamous Dungiven night spot and the Jim was Jim McGroarty. McElhinney was dropping him off in Lettershandoney on their way back from a Finn Harps game. “I had to go and get towed out,” McElhinney remembers. “My da was going mad because it was his car and I was in the bad books for a while.” He was on loan from Parkhead to the Harps. He had one game under his belt in centre midfield against Shamrock Rovers, before regular goalkeeper Gerry Murray got injured. In their hour of need, they turned to McElhinney. “I had played in goals for Dungiven and Patsy McGowankicked a few balls at me under lights in a car park in Ballybofey and reckoned I would be a good goalkeeper.” He was never going to stay in goals. Goalkeeper Packie Bonner used the rough and tumble of the Donegal club GAA scene to toughened him. Coming for crosses was a breeze. McElhinney was dferent. Heplayed a dozen games between the posts for the Harps, but wasnt for him. Boredom set in. He missed the banter of being stuck in the middle of a game. “We did alright, we beat Bohemians on a night when I got man of the match and we had some good times,” he said of this time at the club. This spell came during Gerrys GAA career with Derry and during the summer hed jet off to America for work and play a bit of ball. During his time in Philadelphia, he played with FC Berne and he had trials with Chicago Sting. But as  came to a conclusion, so too did his time in the US. *** When Annie McElhinney answered the phone and a thick Scottish accent filtered down the line, the first thought was that Celtic were back in the hunt for her sons signature. It wasnt, but it was an opportunity to kick-start a soccer career that had been parked. It was the voice of Distillery manager Gibby McKenzie. On hisfrom America, Gerry had written to a few clubs askinghe could get a trial. Distillery were the only club to take notice. “Right big man,you want to come and play for us, you can come and play for us,” McKenzie bellowed down the phone. At the time, they had no ground and shared with Brantwood in Antrim. McElhinney got Kenny Shiels and Eugene Young involved in the club. “At that stage, Distillery pretty much finished bottom of the league every season,” Gerry recalls. “Martin ONeill had gone by the time I got there. I played there for a season and done really well.” McKenzie was replaced as boss by Bertie Neill as manager. He arranged for McElhinney to have a trial with English top-flight club Bristol City, who had Joe Royle on their team. “I played against Vancouver Whitecaps, it was a friendly. We drew - and I thought I did fairly well,” Gerry adds. Manager Alan Dicks was impressed by what he saw, but with the clubs financial situation and so many of the squad on long-term contracts. His hands were tied. “I was that down in the dumps, so I decided to go back to America. I came back again at Christmas and went back to Distillery,” he continues. With a good pre-season under his belt, he was playing well and impressed a Bolton Wanderers scout during a friendly away to Drogheda in July . Within a week, McElhinney and Neill were on a plane over to Bolton.  Gerry in his Bolton kit “I played a friendly against Bury FC. It was - and I done quite well and they more or less signed me straight after the game. “Bolton bought me for a fee that rose to around pound, after I had played a certain amount of games and lined out with Northern Ireland. Distillery moved to their new stadium in Lisburn, got the greyhound track and built that big wall. They reckon my transfer paid for that wall. They were really good to me.” *** Anytime Northern Ireland Billy Bingham came to see Billy Hamilton play for Burnley against Bolton his heart mustve been in his mouth. Gerry McElhinney didnt stand on ceremony. He gave as good as he got. During his first two seasons at Bolton, the international call never came despite being on the standby list for the squad in the build-up to the  World Cup in Spain. “I broke my toe. It had came through my boot and I was injured and wouldve never been fit,” McElhinney admits. Later in his Bolton career, after ing from a -game spell at Rochdale, he forced himself into the first-team and his form earned him an international call-up, with the  European Championships around the corner. Seven games came and went, with McElhinney yet to make an appearance. Their last game was against West Germany, who they had beaten - in Belfast thanks to Ian Stewarts goal earlier in the campaign. With Hamburgs Volksparkstadion filling to an attendance of over ,, Billy Bingham decided to reshuffle his deck and took his Derry contingent to three. Martin ONeill was joined by Paul Ramsay for his second appearance and dropped Chris Nicholl at the expense of Gerry McElhinney for his debut at the age of . Gerry remembers Bingham giving him the news: “Youre playing big man, get yourself sorted out,” he was told. “I didnt think that much about it at the time, it was just a game. You have to understand that I wouldve travelled anywhere for a game of football,” McElhinney said. Just to spice it up, he was up against captain Karl-Heinz Rummenigge who had six goals to his name during the campaign, but the Park mans early tackle laid down a marker. After  minutes, Northern Ireland grew in confidence much to the frustration of the home fans. Early in the second half, Harald Schumacher failed to hold an Ian Stewart effort and when Ramsays shot was blocked, Norman Whiteside fired them into a - lead. McElhinney was part of the back four that thwarted the Germans and on the one occasion they threatened to beat goalkeeper Pat Jennings, Jimmy Nicholl cleared the ball off the line from Lothar Matthaus shot. For four days, Northern Ireland led West Germany by three points in the one qualying spot. “They had a game in hand against Albania to qualy and a win would put them through on score dference,” McElhinney can remember. Their chances were not out of their own hands. The Albanians took an early lead, only for Rummenigge to immediately level the game and with  minutes to go, Gerhard Stracks goal ended their qualication dreams. “After that, I played for Northern Ireland in the Home Championships and we were the last winners of it in ,” McElhinney adds. In the first game, they were - winners over a Scotland side that included Roy Aitken. McElhinney nearly score a third and after the game the Scots manager Jock Stein admitted to McElhinney that he shouldve kept him on at Celtic. *** By Christmas of , Bolton were in the third tier of the league and their bank accounts didnt make for pleasant reading. Aside from a squad of kids, McElhinney and Jeff Chander were the only senior players they could sell to help their plight. “He went to Derby County and I went Plymouth. Bolton got a combined total of pound, and it kept them afloat. Even though they had been relegated from the first ision, they were still getting really good crowds. “They lost a lot of players, with them not being given contracts. Nothing has changed with Bolton, they still have got no money.” During his four years at Plymouth, McElhinney was captain for two seasons as they gained promotion to the old second ision. In his first season,  , he helped tighten up their defence, helping them begin their climb – beginning with a - win over Bolton early in his spell. The following year, Argyle were promoted in second place. ”We beat Bristol City in a mid-week game to seal promotion. Reading won it, we were second and Derby County came third,” McElhinney remembers. His Gaelic career was beginning to take prominence back home and after steering Gortin to the final of the Tyrone senior championship – a game be missed due to Boltons pre-season – he transferred back to Craigbane. “A lot of the guys who sign for Plymouth never leave that area. It is a lovely and Cornwall is on your doorstep,” explains McElhinney, who had the opportunity of following his promotion winning manager to picturesque Torquay. “I was coming home, every now and then, playing Gaelic football on the sly. To come home and play, I had to drive from Plymouth to London to get a flight home. I thought Id move a bit closer, so I moved to Peterborough.” When Peterborough gained promotion in the  season, Gerry was the youth team coach before moving to non-league Corby Town for two seasons at the end of his career. Gerry now lives in Draycott, near Derby where he currently works in construction. He is still fanatical about sport. He is also a guest at Bolton on match-days days and takes part in an open mic question and answer session. “Plymouth get me down too, I am part of the Plymouth Argyle legends and I got my free tie,” he laughs.

The following year, Argyle were promoted in second place. ”We beat Bristol City in a mid-week game to seal promotion. Reading won it, we were second and Derby County came third,” McElhinney remembers. His Gaelic career was beginning to take prominence back home and after steering Gortin to the final of the Tyrone senior championship – a game be missed due to Boltons pre-season – he transferred back to Craigbane. “A lot of the guys who sign for Plymouth never leave that area. It is a lovely and Cornwall is on your doorstep,” explains McElhinney, who had the opportunity of following his promotion winning manager to picturesque Torquay. “I was coming home, every now and then, playing Gaelic football on the sly. To come home and play, I had to drive from Plymouth to London to get a flight home. I thought Id move a bit closer, so I moved to Peterborough.” When Peterborough gained promotion in the  season, Gerry was the youth team coach before moving to non-league Corby Town for two seasons at the end of his career. Gerry now lives in Draycott, near Derby where he currently works in construction. He is still fanatical about sport. He is also a guest at Bolton on match-days days and takes part in an open mic question and answer session. “Plymouth get me down too, I am part of the Plymouth Argyle legends and I got my free tie,” he laughs. Gerry McElhinney – a legend on both sides of the pond. RELATED - The greatest showman - Gerry McElhinneys GAA career. More...

Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. Still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that theyre gone.”  - Morgan Freeman as Red in the Shawshank Redemption Netflix delivered a gem to the sporting fraternity recently in the form of The Last Dance, a behind the scenes documentary following the Chicago Bulls during their six NBA titles in eight seasons during the s. It was casual watching and not needing much concentration, but interesting on a range of dferent levels. googletag.cmd.push The footage of Michael Jordan was just enthralling. His demand for the highest of standards turned around the fortunes of the underperforming Bulls. His brilliance gave him locker room clout beyond his newcomer status. His power to jump and score was sizzling. When he leapt off the court, he was a genius. The Bulls went from winning just over a third of their games to pushing for glory and he was named as Rookie of the Year in his first season. As the series began to pan out, it was centred around three main players and their personalities – Jordan, Scottie Pippen and later Dennis Rodman. googletag.cmd.push Tangled in the storyline was Scottie being grossly underpaid for what he was offering the team. It led to a fallout with the franchise General Manager Jerry Krause. One glance at Dennis Rodman made me think more about team dynamics. He is the ultimate maverick. He came from a broken home but somehow escaped the drug culture that passed by in front of his eyes. The day he lted a basketball saved him. A family friend saw enough to tip off a local school basketball coach and it was his passport to college and eventually the Detroit Pistons. The Pistons were labelled the bad-boys of the NBA. They got into teams faces and under their skins and they developed nasty rivalry with the Bulls. Rodman morphed into one of their most influential players and built up a terric relationship with coach Chuck Daly. So much so, than when Daly – a father figure almost – resigned, Dennis went off the rails. He was a troubled inidual and demanded a transfer. He also dated music star Madonna who convinced him that he needed to express himself and be who he wanted to be and not how others wanted him to fit. HUNCH After a spell with the San Antonio Spurs, Rodman moved on to the Bulls. It was a gamble. The club hierarchy went on a hunch that Dennis would be safe due to the presence of Jordan and Pippen and how they would steer and inspire him. The other factor was the most important – coach Phil Jackson. They knew he could handle him. A glance at Rodman and he is not your everyday player. Tattoos, jewellery all over his face and a hairstyle that changes day on day. Even on one occasion, he had bleached all through his hair, to mark his teammatesto the court from injury. Rodman made me think of that line from the Shawshank Redemption. The one Red mutters when the innocent Andy is on the the brink of escape – some birds are too beautul to cage. And Rodman knew his worth. “Youve got the great Michael Jordan, the great Scottie Pippen and the greatPhil Jackson...you take me away from this team...do they still win the championship  I dont think so,” was one of his comments during the documentary. Everybody  knew it too. In  when the Bulls were chasing their sixth title, Rodman requested some leave time in mid-season and was granted  hours. As Jordan expected, Dennis went AWOL in Las Vegas and they had to go to get him back. Onto training, Jackson put the Bulls through their paces to blow the black smoke out of Rodmans system from his time off the rails. The old fashioned back to the front runs. During laps the player at the back had to sprint to the front, all the way around the court. The GAA pre-season drill from hell. The Bulls players plotted to take it easy on Rodman -and themselves – by keeping the pace low. But when it was his turn, their colourful colleague blew them away and they spent the the rest of the session chasing him. They didnt need to worry. His natural fitness levels could absorb time away from training. The support structures around him were strong. He was motivated by winning and coach Taylor understood the concept of not everyone being the same. You cant put a saddle on a mustang, Chuck Daly once said. Welcome the concept of the maverick. For the manager in team sports, it can be easy to pigeon hole everyone into the same category. That way, you have a simple team ethos andsomeone steps out of line, the pre-written rules leave the decision to omit someone easy. “At the start of the year, everyone knew the story,” would be the narrative. But not everyone is the same. Why should they be  The challenge is how to manage on a dferent scale. Some need a kick up the ass, some need an arm around the shoulder. But in a team scenario, not everybody fits. If someone is too disruptive, has nothing to offer the team and wont meet the coaches rules somewhere in the middle – then cutting them loose is the only option. I remember chatting to former Dungiven manager Jim McGroarty a few weeks ago. He uttered a statement along the lines of...anyone can throw down a load of cones and copy drills off their phone and call themselves a coach, but management is about so much more. He is so right. Having not covered a game of sport since St Pius won their MacLarnon semi-final, watching sport on television has been filling the gap. It has also led to a period of reflection. If we are lucky enough to get through all this, sport should resume in a better place –team managers have also used their time to reflect and not just find a better way of playing  or  men behind the ball. Gerry McElhinney waltzing through the heart of the Dublin midfield, Maradona tearing strips of the England defence in  and Michael Jordan dunking shots with his back to the basket - these are the people who build a legacy. They are players who will inspire and –managed properly - are the dference between a team being average and great. Without them, sport is dull. These are the players teams need to revolve around. Development should not be about seeing how many athletes you can find that can handpass with perfection and follow out orders. Anyone could do that. Dennis Rodman and the mavericks need to meet the team ethos halfway down the path. If they dont, then you can say you tried and agree to go your separate ways. If they understand the word compromise, then so too should the manager. If they cant dferentiate between their ego with the ego of others, they shouldnt be managing.

This follows commitments made by ministers over the weekend that the government will meet with the two representativebodies for publicans over course of the coming week.As part of their discussions with the government, the two organisations will be pressing for pubs to reopen at the same time and on the same basis as cafes and restaurants. Recognising the challenge of maintaining social distancing in a hospitality environment, the organisations will also be putting forward radical changes to the normal operations of barsin order to protect public health.These measures include: googletag.cmd.push • Bars will become dispense bars only with no sitting, standing, ordering, payment or drinking at the bar allowed. • Table service will be a requirement with pubs only serving customers seated at tables. • The numbers on the premises would be confined to no more than  per every  square metres. • A maximum of  people would be permitted at any one table. • Customers will be required to use hand sanitiser upon entry. • All customers must remain seated. • Staff will be fully trained in the new procedures. They will also be asked to maintain a safe distance from customers when taking orders and to wash their hands thoroughlyevery  minutes. googletag.cmd.push • The utilisation of outdoor spaces to enhance social distancing. • Procedures implemented to ensure safe use of toilet facilities, which may include limits on the numbers using toilets at any one time. • No live music or DJs. Speaking about the proposed measures, Donall O’Keeffe, Chief Executive of the LVA said, “We fully respect the need to continue to protect the public health. We have repeatedlyproven this commitment, not least in the fact that our sector was the first to close across the country. We also believe thatother venues who serve food and alcohol are allowed toreopen in Phase , then pubs should be granted the same opportunity to trade. We don’t believe it is in any way appropriate that the Government should apply one rule for somehospitality businesses and another rule for others.“We are making a series of radical proposals to how bars should operate for the reopening scenario. Trading will be extremely dficult under these circumstances. There is no doubtthat the pub experience as we know it will have to change dramatically. Many pubs may choose not to reopen as it simply won’t be financially viable under these conditions.However, for those who want to trade, these measures will have the essential impact of protecting the health and wellbeing of staff and customers alike,” Mr. O’Keeffe said.

Plans have been put forward to construct the new footbridge as part of a proposal to extend Derrys popular quayside walk and cycle path. Derry City and Strabane District Council has applied for planning permission to build the footbridge across an inlet close to the Fort George site. This would allow the quayside walkway to be extended into the Bay Road area. There are also plans to create a new three-metre wide cycle walking path along Bay Road to link in to the Bay Road Park. Derrys quay has been revitalised in recent years and the latest proposal looks set to continue the regeneration of the riverside area. googletag.cmd.push The plans for the new footbridge and walkway are now being considered by the local councils planning department. Meanwhile, a new cycling champion role has been created to encourage more people to get on their bikes in Derry. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon this week announced a new walking and cycling champion with a focus on transforming communities and developing creative solutions to support a new way of living during and post COVID-. “Our champion will ensure that we deliver our commitment to increase the percentage of journeys made by walking and cycling. Inspiring our communities, restructuring our spaces, changing forever the way we live – and changing it for the better,” said the Minister. googletag.cmd.push “I want to increase the space available for people who want to walk and cycle by extending pavements, pedestrianising streetsand introducing pop up cycle lanes. I have already identied someparts ofBelfast City Centre and Derry city that can betransformed in this wayand I intend to work with councils to identy more areas across the North as a matter of urgency. Changing how we use our spaces will transform communities right across Northern Ireland – creatively change lives – enable social distancing and encourage health and mental wellbeing. “Thisenvironmental and public healthwork will be done on a collaborative basis, with an action group, formed from both within and outside government. I also want to work in collaboration with communities, including identying and creating ‘Quiet Streets’ where pedestrians, cyclists and play have priority and motor vehicles are guests,” added Ms Mallon. “As the Executive looks this week to review thelockdown – we all need to be looking ahead – out of the darkness of this pandemic and into a better world that we need to build for ourselves. Greener, cleaner, healthier and happier people and places must be our aim as we learn to live with this new normal during and after Covid-.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA Foyle Martina Anderson said several caravan owners have spoken to her about having to pay fees despite not being able to use their caravans. “It was the right decision to close caravan parks, given the obvious dangers of people staying together in such close proximity during this pandemic, said Ms Anderson. “It is however unfair to expect all caravan owners, many of whom have seen their incomes affected, to continue to pay a pitch fee while they have no access to their caravan. googletag.cmd.push “Park owners need to take into account the circumstances that many caravan owners are facing during these dficult times. “They should therefore consider reducing or waiving annual and partial fees given that owners are unlikely to be able to access their caravans during the summer months at least. “Rather that park owners collaborating to force caravan owner to pay their site fees regardless of the impact of this deadly pandemic, they should be uniting in their call on the Irish Government to put financial support in place to ensure that neither caravan owners or park owners are penalised as a result of this pandemic.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Like all of us, hersquos patiently waiting for when thingsto normal and travel is possible again.ldquoI definitely havenrsquot spent more than at couple of weeks at home since  when my father George died, explains Tim. ldquoItrsquos a real shame that I canlsquot really enjoy everything that Co Down has to offer, but at least home is a good spot. Myself and my mother enjoy going out for a walk along the Quoile river every now and then.The third of four children, Tim has an older sister, Heather, and two brothers, Michael and Pat. Their late father was a highly respected lawyer, who became a county court judge.Ash, the band Tim founded in  at the age of  with fellow Down High School students Mark Hamilton, also from Downpatrick, and Rick McMurray, from Killyleagh, exploded on to the Britpop scene in the mid-s. Known as one of the softer alternative rockpop bands, Ash put Downpatrick well and truly on the music map. Along with the success of the Papenfus brothers, Kenneth and Carl, with their band Relish, and local rockers, The Answer, it was a golden age for music for the town and district.Tim and the band have been recording and touring ever since, having recently embarked on a European tour to support their new specially compiled album, Best of Teenage Wildle ndash  years of Ash. Coming in a combination of vinyl, a special  CD with an  rare track CD, Teenage Wildle has charted well so far, coming top in both the UK and Irish Independent Albums chart and th in the UK Album chart.When President Donald Trump closed the US airports in March, it could not have come at a worst time for the band in promotional terms.Tim explained: ldquoWe were in the middle of European tour in February and everything was just gradually grinding to a standstill. At that time, I did thinkI didnrsquot leave for New York soon there was a chance that I wouldnrsquot get back for two to three months.ldquoBut our UK dates were the following week and they still hadnlsquot been cancelled. I felt that I didnrsquot have a choice so we stayed and we spent three days driving to Hamburg to a gig which got cancelled on the day. We travelled back to the UK and then the tour dates got cancelled the day before the first show was meant to have been held. It was too late for me at that point to get back to the US so I came back to Northern Ireland and stayed at my sisterrsquos place for a week before I went to Downpatrick.While he is enjoying his downtime in Downpatrick, rehoning lyrics to songs he first started several years ago, Tim is naturally concerned about when andhe will get back to New York.ldquoIrsquom technically a temporary resident so Irsquom worried about getting back to the US as Irsquom not a citizen or permanent resident. I was planning to move to London in July as we have a recording studio there with a lease ending soon and we need to move equipment out over the next few months. Thatrsquos all a big question mark now. Irsquove been in New York for  years and would like a chance to say goodbye to everyone.Although the change of pace is dferent at home compared to New York, both are close to Timrsquos heart.ldquoThe number one thing about New York that I love are the people. Itrsquos such an amazing mixof cultures. It has so much energy to the place. The pace is really fast, itrsquos endlessly interesting, he said.ldquoBut Irsquove always been comfortable about coming back to Northern Ireland. We are surrounded by woodland and the Quoile river. When the sun shines, therersquos nowhere better in the world. I like going between the two extremes, itrsquos a really good place to be writing, reading and walking around.Tim recently connected with the world of music globally when he broadcast a live performance from his Downpatrick home to raise money for struggling musicians and artists impacted by the coronavirus lockdown. Organised by the Performing Rights Society , which pays royalties to members when their work is performed in whatever , Tim was one of  big names who took part.He started off with a rendition of his hit, Girl From Mars, performed with an acoustic guitar, and played Shining Light, which he won an Ivor Novello award in  for Best Contemporary Pop Song, finishing off with Teenage Kicks by Derry band The Undertones.ldquoThat felt really good and I felt really connected it was good seeing all the comments coming up, said Tim. ldquoBut to be honest, it was nerve-wrecking doing a broadcast from home as the internet is not too good here. Normally on stage you would have fears of your equipment failing but I was just thinking I hope that this internet does not cut out. If the phone rings the home, the internet cuts out. I was praying that no one would ring my mum in the middle of it.ldquoIt just dawned on me while I was singing Shining Light that I had written it in the same room where I was broadcasting from. Irsquove written a lot of good songs in that room.He joked at how long it normally takes him to release new music and how he is still working on songs he wrote several years ago.ldquoThe guys and I have been chatting a lot still and Irsquove been sending them song ideas and discussing things but I really wish we could get into a rehearsal room and jam through the stuff.

However, more sewers are coming on to help out as word spreads about the initiative.The club put out a call for people to help with the sewing and donations of material and were overwhelmed with the response.Mrs Fowler explained that the group came about after she was approached privately by some peopleshe knew anyone who could provide scrubs.ldquoWe started at the beginning of the month and so far we have made scrubs for four nursing homes, including Barrhall Residential Home in Portaferry, and supplied scrubs to Loughview Medical Centre in Kircubbin and Ballywalter Health Centre.ldquoWe have also supplied scrubs to nurses at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast and the Ulster Hospital in Dundonald as well to nurses in the Nightingale Hospital in Belfast City Tower Block through my sister-in-lawrsquos niece who is a nurse. We are now filling orders from Positive Futures, a group who visit people with learning disabilities who vulnerable, in their own homes and had absolutely no protective gear.

Only last month, all the hanging baskets produced at the New Model Farm site sold out.Locate at the site are two poly tunnels, flower beds and vegetable patches cocooned into a corner of the housing estate, with the apiary also a big hit with beekeepers who have honed their skills with the help of the Killinchy Beekeepers.Allotment holders and groups using the site regularly produce an array of fresh vegetables, flowers and bedding plants, while the beekeepers are producing their own delicious honey which is in its natural state with no additives.Sean Clarke, who is the chairman of Downpatrick Community Allotments, says there is nothing like working in the great outdoors, filling your lungs with fresh air and clearing your mind.ldquoAll our plots are currently taken but we are looking for new volunteers, he explained.ldquoWhen one of our plots does become available, it is snapped up immediately. Some of the townrsquos residentsrsquo groups have taken plots and we are delighted to have a mix of all abilities working at the site.ldquoThere is great camaraderie and we have our very own gardening guru mdash Stephen Harris.ldquoHe is brilliant to have around the place and has an encyclopaedic knowledge of gardening which is being passed on to the volunteers. Stephen once had his own landscaping business and is more than happy to share is extensive knowledge with us.Downpatrick Community Allotments now has its own Facebook page packed with photos and information about what is happening at the New Model Farm site with the social media page helping generate wide interest in what is going on there.ldquoMany people have come along to learn gardening skills including seed planting, propagation and how to fill hanging baskets and it is clear to see their enthusiasm. It is great to be outdoors and enjoying the benefits of physical exercise and fresh air, Sean continued, revealing that within three days of all the hanging baskets produced going on sale they sold out.Given the focus on greater public health awareness as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, all the equipment at the allotments is sanitised before and after use and social distancing regulations are enforced across the site, both at the allotments, in the poly tunnels and apiary.ldquoEveryone is always two metres apart and due to the size of the allotments, three people can work comfortably at the same time, while adhering to the social distancing guidelines.Sean is a great believer in how working at the Model Farm site is good for mental health and said there are many studies which back up his assertion.ldquoPeople really get a lot out of seeing the flowers and vegetables they plant growing and there is always a great buzz about the place. The allotments can certainly help people destress, especially in the current climate.It was planned to bring along a chef to the allotments so the volunteers can learn ious ways they can cook their fresh vegetables and while this has had to be put on hold, it is something Sean is keen to see happening when the pandemic is brought under control and the current lockdown regulations are relaxed.He added: ldquoWe are hoping that we may be able get a chef in around September, but that will depend on the current restrictions being eased.For further information on Downpatrick Community Allotments pay a visit to the grouprsquos Facebook page..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Council.jpg","title":"Council has no plans to lay off current staff  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has this week insisted that it has no current plans to lay off staff.The confirmation comes after Antrim and Newtownabbey Council confirmed last week that it was planning to make a number of employees redundant, with  jobs affected.However, officials subsequently deferred a decision on  positions, but  agency staff are to be let go due to funding pressures during the coronavirus pandemic.Defending its decision to cut jobs, the council said it had faced an ldquounprecedented financial challenge due to signicantly reduced revenues following the closure of public facilities.It also confirmed there has been ldquono confirmation of any additional funding being provided to councils from government and the UK-wide furlough scheme is not expected to be used by local authorities.While the planned job losses are subject to negotiations with trade unions, Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey made it clear that she will not support actions of councilsthey do not respect and protect workersrsquo rights.The minister said that each of Northern Irelandrsquos  councils mdash including Newry, Mourne and Down.ldquoI call on councils and other employers to do all in their power to safeguard jobs so that when the current restrictions are lted, those very workers can contribute to the economic recovery that we will so badly need, she remarked.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the provincersquos  councils mdash said councils were facing ldquoshort and long-term financial pressures like never before.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed that no decision has been taken in relation to reducing staff number ldquoat this time.Former NILGA president and Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos announcement.ldquoThese are unprecedented times and the local authority has lost a signicant amount of income given the closure of leisure and community facilities across the district, he said.ldquoVarious staff have been redeployed across the organisation and at these terribly dficult times, they are working to maintain services with others playing key roles in helping to deliver food packages to residents across the district.Cllr Curran said he would not want to see anyone losing their job and hopes the local council will continue to work hard to make sure this does happen anywhere within the organisation.ldquoNo one could have predicted the situation we now find ourselves in, he continued. ldquoItrsquos important that the public plays its part, stays at homeit all possible and when out, exercise social distancing to help protect the HNS and save lives.ldquoMany people have lost their jobs through no fault of their own and I hope that in the not too distant future, lockdown measures will start to be eased to help rebuild the local economy and people can get back to work.He added: ldquoThis will not happen overnight, but the more we obey public health advice now, the sooner the lockdown can be eased..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Evan.jpg","title":"Evan and mum raising dough for charity during virus lockdown  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman and her little son have been busy baking tasty treats on social media to help raise money for a local mental health charity since the lockdown began.When Pauline Smyth was forced to close the doors of the Blue Bay Cafe in Dundrum due to the outbreak of the Coronavirus, she and two year-old Evan took to baking some of their favourite recipes.For almost four weeks, the pair have stirred, sted and simmered their way through a mountain of ingredients, making everything from pizza pin wheels to Portuguese custard tarts and posting snap shots of their combined efforts on the Blue Bay Cafe  Bakery Facebook page, along with the recipes.Pauline says Evan loves to help out, especially when it comes to making doughnuts.

second week of serious assaults which left one local man requiring hospital treatment for sustained severe head injuries, inflicted during a vicious attack at the Bishopsbrae area.Mr McGuigan has also highlighted an incident when a family were forced to flee their Leaside Gardens home in the Flying Horse estate after a malicious blaze.In addition, two other young men were bundled into a car and taken to the Steamboat Quay area at the Quoile River where they were assaulted.Two weeks ago, an ongoing feud between two Downpatrick families was blamed for a shooting incident at the Vianstown Park

accommodation, and claims they paint a very wrong picture of the county town.The police chief said the sequence of recent events does nothing to enhance Downpatrickrsquos reputation and said people who live in a civilised community must accept the rule oflaw.DUNDRUM ndash A Dundrum man confronted a skinhead burglar in his home during the early hours of Monday morning and forced him to flee the

The county was a footballing powerhouse once more, landing two All-Ireland titles in the space of three years and the players secured their place in GAA folklore.An immovable force was their goalkeeper Neil Collins. He thwarted Meath in the  and in  memorably saved a penalty from Dublin danger man Charlie Coleman.Now a youthful , Neil began his football career with Ballymartin and then with Drumaness. But he is best known for his association with Carryduff. He broke into the Down senior  in  and remained in the squad for ten years.He remained a dedicated servant of Down long after his playing career ended. He managed the county U- team for three years, was goalkeeping coach of the senior team for six years and also a selector for three years when the team was managed by his All-Ireland-winning colleague, the late and much missed Eamonn Burns.Neil hasnrsquot included himself in his  greatest Down players, but for the others donrsquot look much further than his team-mates from the early Nineties.ldquoThese were the players I grew up with, so I have to stick with them. Irsquom too young to remember the Sixties, he says.ldquoI had a great time with Down. Obviously the highlights were winning the two All-Irelandrsquos, but I have wonderful memories of the people I played with and all the friendships.ldquoThanks to WhatsApp I am in contact with them every day. We had the th reunion of the  team in Dublin last year and we also got together to remember the th anniversary of the Loughinisland tragedy.ldquoThey are a great bunch of lads, but you canrsquot put a foot wrong, otherwise you would be pulled up very quickly. Pat DonnanPat was goalkeeper for the Down minors which won the All-Ireland title in  and was goalkeeper for the senior team for many years. He was a great keeper and became a mentor to me. He took me under his wing and made me a better player. He was also generous with time and advice. A great goalkeeper and an even greater man. Miceal MagillThis is the most dficult pick. It was between Miceal and Brendan McKernan, but I have gone for Miceal, largely because of his performance in the  final which won him the Ulster Bank Man of the Match award. He had a fantastic game and never let Charlie Redmond get away from him. He was always comfortable with the ball and could read a game well. Conor DeeganConor was a tremendous athlete and he could take on the oppositionrsquos biggest players. He always seemed to get on top of his opponents and I never once saw him roasted. He had terric hands and he could read a game as well as anyone. He always encouraged those around him. He was a true team player. Paul HigginsPaul was as hard as nails and he was also the quickest player in the squad, even faster than Mickey Linden. He dominated and bullied his opponents and he had great strength of character. John KellyMy Carryduff clubmate and a ruthless, nasty player in the best possible way. He was the sort of player nobody wanted to mark, whether in a match or in training. He would put his head where others feared to put their feet. Barry BreenAnother double All-Ireland winner. I first played with him at the Red High. Barry always seemed to have time on the ball. He played at a dferent level to everyone . What set him apart though was that he could play with his head up and see what was going on. He was always looking for someone off the ball. DJ KaneOur captain in  and an inspirational leader. DJ was one of the most competitive players I have seen in my le. He would not lie down and did not know what it meant to be beaten. It was win at all costs and he was someone you needed when things got bad. Gregory McCartanA massive character both on and off the pitch. Gregory kept the craic going in the changing room and in the bar afterwards. But he was also a tremendous footballer. He could take a free with either foot. He put money on himself to get the first score in the  final, which he did. Eamonn BurnsAn absolute gentleman, but a warrior on the pitch. He was quiet and unassuming, but had everything you wanted in a player. He scored two sublime points in the , which we won by two points, so he played a huge part in getting us over the line. His death came as a great shock. He is a much missed colleague. Ross CarrA Rolls Royce footballer. He had a wonderful left foot and was one of our two main free takers. Ross had a massive amount of inward drive and challenged us all to perform to the same high standards which he set for himself. Greg Blaney . Quite simply the best player I ever played with. He had it all. He was a brilliant ball player who made the forward line tick. He was always looking to play in James McCartan or Mickey Linden and wasnrsquot worried about scoring himself. An absolute team player. Gary MasonA superb free taker, particularly when under pressure. He never failed us. In June  he played for Down against Monaghan. It was the day after the Loughinisland tragedy. He must have been under enormous mental pressure and anguish, but he put on a massive exhibition and was man of the match. Mickey LindenWhat can you say about Mickey  He was an absolute flying machine and totally dedicated to Down football. He was still playing county football at the age of . A player of exceptional ability and one of the nicest men you could meet off the pitch. Peter WithnellA big, strong one-man wrecking ball. He would hit opponents very hard and early on. Peter brought something dferent to the team and his game fitted in well with the players Down manager Peter McGrath put around him. Many of their scores came about because of him. James McCartanConfident and aggressive with the ability to find space where he had no right to. Every time James got the ball, there was a buzz in the crowd. He was man of the match in the  All-Ireland final. He went on to manage Down and took them to the  final.Substitutes: Brendan McKernan , Aidan Farrell , Liam Austin , Ambrose Rogers Sr , Ciaran McCabe ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29th April 2020 Heather.jpg","title":"Heather coaching the kids  ","story":"A COMBER soccer coach is keeping local children on the ball mdash despite the coronavirus shutdown.Heather Kerr normally coaches primary school children, but now she is passing on her skills online and on social media.Heather, a player and coach with Comber Ladies and an Irish FA staff member, admits it can be a challenge keeping children active and entertained in the current lockdown, but she believes she has the answers.Heather is also a key member of the IFArsquos Electric Ireland Shooting Stars programme aimed at young girls and she says keeping it fun is the key to keeping kids engaged with their extra-curricular activities.ldquoItrsquos all about making sure that they are having fun while learning something new, she says.ldquoEven though your little ones arenrsquot getting out on the pitch they can still be trying out new skills at home.Heather has been involved in football since an early age and was inspired by her dad, who was a coach.ldquoI started volunteering with the youth section of my local club, Comber Rec when I was , and Irsquove been involved in some sort of coaching ever since, she explained.ldquoI completed a weekrsquos work experience with the Irish FA around this time too and I really got a taste of all the dferent aspects of what is involved in football development.ldquoOver the years I worked through my coaching badges and recently completed my A Licence.ldquoI have been coaching in primary schools for the Irish FA since .

I havenrsquot been running for a few years now but I was persuaded to get up off my rear end and try to mark the th anniversary of the postponed London marathon due to be held on the very appropriate th April by running or walking or generally moving over a distance of  or . miles or kilometres.And having sorted out a route around my garden, estimated to be  metres long, I worked out that  laps per mile would be achievable over the five days specied mdash i.e. I could walk  laps to count as . miles. And I also asked my friends for some sponsorship towards the Cure Parkinsonrsquos Trust . I am hugely indebted to everyone who contributed towards this charity, and raised pound. plus pound. Gt Aid. Which reminds me I must go and finish the last eight laps.At the top end of the sport, international marathon runner and Rio Olympian Paul Pollock, while naturally disappointed that the Olympics have been postponed until , feels that it could well prove to be a blessing in disguise in his case at least.He reasons that it will give him an opportunity to concentrate on clocking up stress-free miles in training, enabling him to recover from old injuries and come to the competition, for the first time ever, in the best shape of his le.Portaferry star Ciara Mageean, Irelandrsquos greatest hope of an Olympic track medal since the halcyon days of Sonia OrsquoSullivan, is also disappointed, having been, as she says, in the form of her le, but, like Paul, will continue with her planned training regime and sees it as an opportunity to build up her strength and thus make up the ground on her nearest rivals.Eoghanrsquos viewNewcastlersquos Eoghan Totten, who aspires to taking part in a future Olympic Games as a marathon runner, in a recent interview published in the Athletics NI webpages said: ldquoWhen I recorded a : personal best over the half marathon in Barcelona in mid-February, the virus was relatively undocumented in Europe.ldquoBy mid-March, I understood that I would not be racing for a long time. My biggestfear was that there would be a blanket ban on exercise. Nonetheless, the sanctions under which we are all living have forced me to reconsider the spirit in which I run. I decided that I would follow lockdown protocol as strictly as possible to do my part.Double runshave always been a staple part of my training, allowing me to hit the high mileage required to prepare for the marathon. Completing the same mileage across the week off one daily training session was initially challenging. However, I eventually adapted after two weeks of attrition. In the process, I learned that I benefit from the extra recovery time between runs. This pleasant surprise helped me come to terms with what seems like a more or less empty race calendar in .I can understand that many of you will be disappointed not to be running the Belfast Marathon this weekend, but your chance to do so will come around again in the future. Anyone who is brave enough to step on the start line of a marathon is a special type of person, irrespective of fitness. More so those who run to raise money for a cause. It takes courage to do this. Bank that courage and build on it over the coming months.Athletes are creatures of habit. We are conditioned to race on a monthly or two-monthly basis. Having the options restricted has enabled me to focus on the process of training without looking too far ahead. It has reminded me that, despite thriving off pushing to my limits in races, I love the journey, equally as much.ldquoYes, it is all about achieving in races, but also, to get there a long time is spent training . So we have to love the training too.Right now, I have to wait. We all have to wait. Runners are resilient. Focus on whatever training you can do right now and enjoy the journey.ldquoTo those friends and family in the health service, who have been tackling the virus over the past six weeks, I am amazed beyond words. Thank you for what you are doing.Club updateThese words echo the sentiment of all of us and we commend all key workers who have been put in the front line in the course of their work. We have many EDAC members who are in that position and we send them our best wishes.So what of the last six weeks  The clubrooms were closed with immediate effect and the committee advised all members of the governmental advice to stay home and stay safe. The only good news was that there was no ban on exercising so long as training was done solo or in household groups.It may seem crass to be concerned about the ability to train when there are much bigger issues at stake, but it is well known that sticking to some routine is beneficial in keeping mental health in good order and anything which allows us to be positive will help us to cope with the situation that has evolved.Most have been taking daily exercise as prescribed by the government as it is already a part of our daily routine. However, because of the restrictions on movements and associations and the change of routine for many, whether through being laid off work, working from home, working for NHS at the coal face so to speak, or any of above combined with the added dficulties of home schooling kids of whatever age, it means that many runners are no longer free to go for a run whenever they chose or indeed will have to make signicant changes to their daily routine to fit it in.Some have turned their daily run into a practical outing where they canessential items to those who are shielding. Others have managed to combine their exercise with fund raising for charities involved in the frontline or for organisations who will see their funding hit by the economic fallout of the pandemic.Our juniors could be forgiven for thinking this is an unexpected long summer break, but they report back from time to time to log that fact that they are knuckling down to home schooling while using exercise to take a break.Jarlath and Anna Kearney have committed to a daily .k run, Mackenzie and Ky Murray have been out with their dad, Dee, making sure he doesnrsquot slack. Mackenzie even recorded an unofficial K PB this week.Ollie and Alex Robinson have the good fortune to be able to train as a family and they push each other as well as mum Marguerite. It is no surprise that dedicated athlete Lauren Madine is training away in between exercising the horses. Others such as Emily Burns have opted to cross train.If baking was an Olympic event, there would be a few EDAC records set there too by the sound of things. Tik Tok also seems to be a favourite occupation with some slick dance routines doing the rounds. The one thing that is clear is that our juniors miss their club mates but that physical exercise in any form is a big help. We are proud of our juniors for this mature approach and urge them to continue their efforts.Virtual challengesSome of the races that have been cancelled have then gone ahead in a virtual form, the Titanic K being one. Runners were invited to run a solo K on any course near their home and record the time.Three EDAC runners claimed the reward mdash a T-shirt and medal in the post. Gareth Reilly was the quickest of the trio, posting a -minute time. Hallie Jennings stole a march on Donal Smith by a couple of minutes mdash  minutes to his  mdash but with all runners doing dferent courses it was mainly for fun.Also for fun and the motivation to keep going was the Galbally Runners April Challenge. A simple concept where each runner chose a target of ,, or  miles etc and then had a month to complete. Evidence was submitted by Strava or fitness watch records.Kelly Smith and Donal Smith blew their goals out of the water with totals over  miles each. Marguerite Robinson, Hallie Jennings and Suzy Smith broke  miles in their inidual sessions and Alison Carroll completed a conservative  miles to start a new regime. They all agreed that it was a good way to keep base fitness. Buffs are apparently in the post and thanks are due to Galbally Runners for sorting this.Some runners were racking up the miles and others were thinking of improving speed. Jimmy Sloan has been following a programme which is hard without club members to egg him on, but he has been very successful nonetheless with a new K PB of .. All times are, of course, unofficial as they are not on measured courses but they are a good indicator of form.Jimmy was taking part in the NHS Run , Donate , Nominate . Many of our members will have taken part and the fun can be in nominating friends who would hate to run five km, let alone five miles mdash they canrsquot really refuse when it is for such a good cause!Every club has its mile munchers and in normal times Phillip Vint would see a weekend without a marathon as a waste of a free day. Like others, he has had to get used to a new normal, but when the weekend of the postponed London Marathon came round, he couldnrsquot resist setting off on a . mile course close to home to mark the day.No crowds to cheer him on and no sights of London to entertain him en route, but he was glad that he had the health to complete it. Predictably with the Belfast Marathon also called off, he repeated his endeavours seven days later and clocked another marathon with ease.The best bit is that the finish line is his own back door so no painful walk back to get the car or the train. He was straight to the sofa in seconds and recovery could begin.Donal Smith was to have completed his inaugural marathon at Belfast , as was his daughter, Kelly. Again their hard training seemed lost without a cause, but they had followed the programme to the letter and felt that they needed to test the waters.They set off to give it a rattle and coped well with the dry run of the full marathon distance. They were delighted to get the odd toot and cheer as a substitute for race day atmosphere and they received hearty congratulations when they posted their achievement on social media.While it would have been nice to have friends and family there to greet them at the finish line, it just means that they will have the incentive to do it all again when an official Belfast Marathon can eventually take place. At least they know that they can cope with the mileage and surely with the crowd support it can only be easier Last, but not least, EDAC ultra man himself Keith Reilly has been thinking up ways to raise money and satisfy his need for a challenge at the same time. He decided that his lockdown event would be a treadmill ultra and that he would appeal for funds for NHS Charities Together.He managed . miles running in hourly shts which is no mean feat on a treadmill and logged his th ultra marathon. He was delighted to announce a total of pound, for the frontline workers dealing with Covid- patients. A good dayrsquos work all round.So there you have it from both ends of the scale mdash what the top runners think and do and what the rest of us do. Not a lot of dference really is there  Letrsquos all continue to play by the rules and hope for better times. Stay safe and see you all when the lockdown is lted..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Loughinisland.jpg","title":"Loughinisland woman ‘was friend to all’  ","story":"THE artist son of a Loughinisland woman who has died has said his mother was his ldquobiggest fan.Sixty-four year-old Mrs Kate Sloan was buried in St Macartanrsquos New Cemetery in Loughinisland on Saturday.

on the latest phase of a mains gas pipe-laying scheme.The Recorder revealed last week that Phoenix Natural Gas has seized the opportunity to make the most of the coronavirus lockdown by bringing forward work on the scheme in the resort as part of its poundm investment programme across East Down.Work started last week at the Dundrum Road and Railway Street junctions with Main Street, with contractors switching attention to a stretch of road between the Railway Street junction and Castle Bridge, adjacent to Newcastle library, from this week.Next Monday, it is planned to lay a section of mains pipe between Castle Bridge and the Bryansford Road junction, while seven days later, contractors will be laying pipework along the Bryansford Road, between the Central Promenade and Shimna road junctions.This particular part of the scheme concludes with a pipe being laid between the Bryansford Road and Bryansford Avenue junctions at Shimna Road.Work in the town centre was scheduled to start towards the end of the year, but Phoenix officials have been working with the Department for Infrastructure to identy areas where pipe-laying could be brought forward in order to avoid further disruption to traders, visitors and residents.Phoenix says it understands that Covid- has had a signicant impact socially and economically across the region and hopes that by expediting its works in Newcastle, it can utilise the lockdown period to not only avoid further disruption later in the year, but enable more people to have access to fuel choice before the winter period.The works will involve one lane closure mdash rather than a full road closure mdash with traffic management plans also in place and Phoenix aiming to utilise underground drilling equipment where possible.In addition, the company insists that its work will not impact on Newcastlersquos granite paving which was part of the resortrsquos multi-million pound public realm scheme completed a number of years

in her stride mdash almost.The  year-old Portaferry runner, who is currently holed up in Manchester, says the current restrictions arenrsquot that far removed from her normal training regime.Even so, she says there are days when she does not want to run and she also misses her family and friends back at home.ldquoWersquore all struggling mdash therersquos days I donrsquot even want to go out and run now, and that the thing I have to do and the thingI always look forward to, she said.ldquoTherersquos days Irsquove cried and been like, lsquoWhat the hell is this rsquo Irsquove chatted to my

Balance, Ciara lives in Manchester in the same house with fellow athletes Jip Vastenburg and Adam Craig. Right now shersquos spending a lot more time inside the house than outside.ldquoThankfully my training hasnrsquot changed hugely, but wersquore in the house an awful lot more. The whole season has disappeared, which is very strange because wersquore training without any real focus.ldquoWersquore all watching the news and seeing whatrsquos happening the world over, and wersquore all far away from our families.ldquoLast week Jip lost her grandmother and she couldnrsquot get home for the funeral mdash she had to watch it over Skype.Ciara is worried about members of her own family. Her elder sister, Myra, is a registrar at a hospital in Belfast, her younger sister, Nuala, is a nursing student, younger brother Brendan has volunteered to work in the Nightingale hospital in London and her mother, Catherine, also works in the NHS, while an aunt is a pharmacist. She also misses her boyfriend, who she hasnrsquot seen in a month.Ciara, who won the m bronze medal at the  European Championships and bronze again at the European Indoor Championships last year, happens to be in the form of her le.She improved on her own Irish indoor m record in January and smashed her personal indoor best at m a month later.Training and events were geared towards the Tokyo Games this summer but the Olympics have been pushed back to  because of the coronavirus pandemic.ldquoIrsquom feeling in fantastic shape so itrsquos a little frustrating - we had the whole season planned out, she said.ldquoEven down to the training camps you were going to go on, down to the very day that I was going tointo the Olympic village and then the day that I would possibly leave the Olympic village.ldquoIt is quite tough because all of those plans are all scuppered, itrsquos all up in the air and we donrsquot know when wersquore going to be able to start racing.ldquoThe circuit doesnrsquot have a clue when theyrsquore going to be able to race - it depends on when countries allow more movement and, ultimately, does anybody know ldquoIrsquom not going to feel too sorry for myself because I know therersquos an awful lot of people out there that are in a much harder place than me.In a recent interview with RTE Ciara revealed something about how she is coping with the coronavirus restrictionsQ Whatrsquos the first thing you do in the morning A At the minute when I wake up Irsquove been giving my boyfriend a wee call to say good morning. Irsquom not quite sure when Irsquoll get to see him next as Irsquom in Manchester and he is in Dublin so itrsquos a nice way to start my day and always puts a smile on my face.Q Whatrsquos your favourite exercise A Oh I feel like I should say running, as I am an athlete, butI was to think of my favourite it would probably be a few things. I do miss playing a team sport so probably camogie, I absolutely loved dodge ball in school sothat was an option Irsquod pick that, and I do enjoy my gym workouts getting to lt weights.Q Is there one particular skill you practice every day A Running, every day! Running is a gross motor sport so fine skills arenrsquot really a part of my daily training, but I do work on dferent areas of my fitness every day. I have to work on things such as flexibility and fine muscle control every day to keep myself injury free. In the athlete house though we have been honing dferent skills while on lockdown, trying out dferent Tik Tok dances, press ups, and trying to get our eye in with the sling shot in the back garden!Q Netflix and chill or a nice evening jog A Both, usually we have an evening run, easy four miles... then we chill and watch a movie after dinner. We have had to mix training up a bit with the changes but in an ideal world we get both in.Q Name one book you want to read.A Irsquom making my way through a few Malcolm Gladwell books. I love coming away with new information and enjoy a book that challenges my thought process. Then when I need to flake out Irsquod pick something like A Man Called Ove. Soanyone could recommend books like this to me theyrsquod be on my ldquowant to read list.Q On a scale of  to , how good are your DIY skills A Ohhhh, Irsquom going to give myself an . -  here. My daddy is a joiner so I spent my le watching him make and fix things, and soon learned the names of tools and how to use them. I do know my limits though so I stay away from the plumbing... luckily in Portaferry my dad has a lot of friends who are alsotradesmen so they all help each other out.Q Have you a favourite pre-training meal to help you through a tough session A We usually train in the morning so I tend to eat an OTE DuoBar, the vanilla flavour in my favourite, and a cup of tea. When it come to racing in the evening, something easy to digest is usually what I go for... rice is always a winner.Q Name one movie you want to watch.A , I was planning on watching it in the cinema before the lockdown.Q Whatrsquos the best way to stave off boredom A Oh as a full-time athlete I feel Irsquove been preparing for lockdown for years. My le is basically train, eat, sleep. For me therersquos a few things I enjoy. I love chatting with my family, Irsquom usually on WhatsApp most of the day chatting or messaging and keeping in touch. I also love arts and crafts, Irsquoll be making postcards to post to my boyfriend and siblings to make them laugh, and currently my little cousin is teaching me the guitar via WhatsApp. She is a tough taskmaster, I have a lesson every Thursday and Monday and homework in between so that keeps me busy Q Have you any tips for training at home A Set yourself some goals that you can realistically achieve from home. We are allowed out for our daily exercise so you can get some cardio in outside, find a route that works for you and follow the guidelines. When it comes to working out inside, have fun. Find new alternatives, there are so many exercises we can do with body weight, or with stuff we have about the house so be creative and have a bit of craic. If you need any ideas check out social media, so many people are sharing home workouts. Give yourself a plan or schedule and try to stick to it. Being home means we can fall into the habit of sitting about and it can be hard to feel motivated. At the beginning of each week set out your plan for the week, what day, what time, and what exercise. Write it down and stick it somewhere you can see. Creating a routineduring these strange times means we can take back a little control.Q Name one documentary you want to see.A Anything with David Attenborough, I absolutely love animals and nature, and could listen to his voice all day.Q Have you discovered any new music or podcasts A My music taste is so ied but my wee sis and cousin Tara introduced me to Beoga and I absolutely love it. A lad from my hometown, Ryan McMullan also features in some of their songs, always a nice surprise hearing a weePortaferry accent as Irsquom listening.Q Is there one piece of housework you can no longer avoid A My own room! I actually enjoy housework, everywhere but my own bedroom. Irsquoll clean all day but canrsquot be bothered with my own mess!Q Favourite room of the house to spend time in A We are lucky that the Team NB Manchester athlete house is lovely and has lots of space so my favourite room ies depending in the time of day. In the morning my bedroom gets lovely light, it makes me smile sitting there chilling. Then when I want a bit of company the front room or kitchen is where we chill as a team and have the craic... andthe sun shines, which it does on the odd occasion over here, we have a lovely garden.Both Jip and Adam are enjoying learning how to puck about with my hurl..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/6th May 2020 Recycling.jpg","title":"Recycling facilities to reopen  ","story":"THE districtrsquos household recycling centres could reopen next week.Located in Downpatrick, Castlewellan and Ballynahinch, the centres closed at the end of March in line with the government directive to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.The Recorder understands that the sites will reopen, provided Newry, Mourne and Down Council can satisfy itself that the move can be managed safely and there is no risk to the public or frontline staff.Mid and East Antrim Council has already opened its recycling centres and Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots recently published guidelines aimed at paving the way for waste centres across the province to reopen.The reopening is expected to be discussed at todayrsquos virtual meeting between senior council officials and the leaders of the main political parties.Members of the local authorityrsquos senior management team are currently evaluating theenvironment ministerrsquos guidelines and developing a staff plan to allow the reopening to proceed in a safe way.In addition, officers are liaising with their recycling contractors, a number of whom have furloughed staff. The contractors are responsible for removing waste from all  council amenity sites, with early suggestions that it could take at least one week to ready themselves for reopening.With strict guidelines in relation to social distancing remaining in place, council officers are looking at the potential risks of reopening the sites and the required measures to mitigate them, with suggestions that ratepayers may have to book a slot to visit.Police and other statutory bodies, including the Department for Infrastructure, along with neighbouring councils, are also being consulted about reopening the sites.Council officers have suggested the recycling sites will open in a ldquophased manner and that certain restrictions will apply. Discussions with trade union officials are also planned.This Friday, the Northern Ireland Executive will review the current coronavirus regulations which could pave the way for the reopening of recycling centres not just in the local council area, but across Northern Ireland.Local councillors Willie Clarke and Billy Walker say Newry, Mourne and Down Council is right to carefully assess the guidelines published by Mr Poots and proceed with caution.They say the key importance is the safety of staff and residents, with the councillors suggesting that a visit to a civic amenity site would need to be classed as an ldquoessential journey under the current coronavirus legislation.Cllr Clarke says it is vital that the council approaches the reopening issue with caution, given that ldquocoronavirus is still rampant and people are dying.He continued: ldquoAny decision needs to be based on medical advice and direction from the Assembly.ldquoRecycling centres have not been classed as an essential service and people on their way to such a facility could end up getting stopped by police and issued with an enforcement ticket and sent home.ldquoThe council must ensure that all the Trsquos are crossed and the Irsquos dotted before the centres reopen. I understand there is a need across the community for this to happen, but my appeal to people is be patient for just a little longer.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoA phased approach to reopening the centres has been discussed by the party leaders. There is no point opening the centresthe contractors who remove the waste are not able to do so.

Also, much of the public sector is non frontline, yet unscathed by this crisis, while almost everyone  faces some hardship : User A week later, everyone in JPI Media,the News Letter owner, was told a pay cut was being imposed.No-one was surprised by the chief executive David King’s announcement. Other media groups had already done the same, and furloughedmore people than JPI did.In our case, no-one earning £, has had a pay cut, and above cuts were graduated all the way up to the top, with Mr King and the best paid executives losing %.No-one was thrilled about the cut but I heard no complaint. We respected the symbolism of the tiering, so that the best paid lost most.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

We have all learned a lot since then about Covid- and the impact of measures to halt it.One thing I have learned is a concept of Total Harm Minimisation, which means measuring the entirety of harm after a certain course of action. For example, forcing people to stay home might stop Covid- but cause other problems that are as bad or maybe worse. So you need to measure all costs and benefits.That will take years of careful examination of data. No doubt when results emerge not all the experts will agree on what they mean.My own emerging sense is that this first wave of the virus is nothing like as bad as it might have been, that this is not just due to lockdown – and that evenit was, the unintended consequences of lockdown might be as bad as the benefits.But that is only my sense [possible reasons why are given at the end of this article]. We all make our own judgments. My point in this column is the utterly uneven way that people are suffering from lockdown.This is nobody’s fault — no-one planned for restaurants to be destroyed and supermarkets boom.No-one decided that some people would be stuck in flats, and others in houses with large gardens. Butthis is going to go on and on, and some politicians almost scold us when they imply it will, then we need a new concept called, let us say, Total Harm Distribution.At present the economic harm distribution is wildly unbalanced.One long-term solution is to have a careful look at who is paid what.Most people think low paid key workers get a raw deal and there has been cross-party awareness of this. The  Labour government brought in a minimum wage, the  Tory-Lib one boosted it . It is easy to call for rises, but who pays for it  In an ideal world white collar workers, people like journalistsin an office, might face a pay trim to help fund manual workers.Butthis crisis goes on another subset of issues must be addressed. Leaders of private companies are taking big pay cuts, so perhaps public sector leaders and politicians will too  Many of the latter say lockdownis here to stay in the short term.I have written unpopular articles suggesting we pay politicians more , to attract talent. But there could be a temporary symbolic cut.And what about the swathes of the public sectorwho areunscathed by this crisis, while almost everyone  faces some sacrice  Few civil servants are frontline.In the same way that lists of essential businesses were drawn up, perhaps the same should be done for frontline NHS and key staff, who get a temporary bonus, while non essential public sector have a pay trim to help the national effort.There have been problems getting technology so that all civil servants can work at home, which is understandable given global demand on laptops, but it does suggest that some people have been at home for weeks on full pay. I put this to Stormont – they say that the “vast majority” are “working in line with latest guidance” It was political cowardice that Stormont went ahead with the teacher a pay rise, while sending out signals that schools will not reopen until September, and possibly only in a phased way even then.Memories are fading of the financial disaster in the s, when unions dictated pay, leading the UK to the International Monetary Fund.Meanwhile, appeal judges in Belfast last week put pressure on the attorney general to hold yet another inquest into a Troubles death where state failure is alleged .When people and businesses face ruin and when key workers are risking their health amid a shortage of protection gear, some of this taxpayer-funded expenditure is merely an insult.But some of it is an outrage. • Some reasons to be concerned at the grave harmof lockdown:There are, according to the Office for National Statistics, , unexplained excess deaths per week, in addition to , excess Covid deaths — a total of , excess deaths, which means deaths that above the average for a typical week at this time of year. It might ultimately be that the non Covid deaths are of people who are notably younger than the Covid patients who are dying, who have an average age of +, and many of whom were already gravely ill. We can speculate on about five likely types of non Covid deaths caused by lockdown: • Suicide .• Premature deaths from chronic loneliness of people who had little social contact before this crisis and now have none, or chronic stress of people who have lost jobs or are confined in an unhappy household .• Deaths from conditions that are not getting the treatment they normally do: heart, cancer, stroke.• Deaths from a depression plunging people around the world into poverty, reducing le expectancy. These latter deaths will take many years to show in statistics.• I asked the Department of Financeit was true thate some civil servants been at home for weeks on full pay with nothing to do  If so, is it a large number. Are there plans to change that  Andso, how will it change  When A Department of Finance spokesperson replied:“During the Covid- pandemic the vast majority of civil servants have continued to work in line with the latest guidance, either attending their workplaces safely or working remotely.“Civil servants have provided services and support to a wide range of people, including those members of society and businesses impacted by Covid-. Departments have redeployed staff to deliver priority work.“The Civil Service have been working over the past two years to change the way it works providing staff with the flexibility to work remotely. Services and working practices will continue to evolve in the future with more digital services coming online to serve citizens ensuring that staff can work efficiently from remote locations.”• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry in : If we want better politicians we might have to pay them more• News Letter home delivery service is expanded—— ——A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

In anticipation of what none of us wants to hear, politicians at Westminister got an earful from no less a person than Baroness Altmann, a former pensions minister, who warned there could be ‘social unrest’the over s are ‘forced to endure a longer lockdown than the younger generation’.This is a country where once upon a time women could retire at  and men at  – as that was regarded as old age. But people have been living longer due to better living standards, the results of all the hard work the baby boomer generation put in right up to the present time. This appears to have emboldened successive Governments to raise the age of retirement age for both men and women. More money in the public coffers is the result.

Putting up the age of retirement also means there will be less years for state pensions to be paid out.I worry at what appears to be the increasing use of the term ‘healthy over s’. What exactly does that mean  Few people in this age category I suspect enjoy perfect health, otherwise GPs across the land wouldn’t be advising them to take statins to keep blood pressure levels down. Women have been encouraged to take HRT long after menopause, even staying on it for leneeds be. These le enhancers, as some medical people appear to regard them, may be just the ticket. But how are we to know since the latter, statins, are relatively new to the people whilst HRT still attracts controversy Do either of these treatments increase longevity  We simply don’t know the answer to that question.Locking down the over-s, many of whom will still be paying tax to the Government, could be interpreted in many ways. I will take the kindly approach and suggest that the Government will need all the scope it has to get the economy back up and running schools will have to be re-opened and plans will have to be laid for the possibility of a future pandemic since the current one caught everyone by surprise and left the country on its knees. With the absolute necessity to get people back to work and paying income tax, the Government must have thought the oldies could wait and since many of them will have ious ailments it could be dressed up as ‘protecting them’. One Cabinet minister has said the whole thing ‘is to be based around consent rather than compulsion’.That’s fine, but it appears no one asked us first whether we wanted to be lockdowned for longer or left to do our own thing.I certainly do not want to be on lockdown for any more weeks than I have to because once you hit your s le seems to go by in a flash. It seems no time since my children were clinging to my skirts wanting me to play in the garden. Anniversaries and birthdays came and went with me so busy I scarcely noticed. The children grew up with me hardly noticing the years go by and then they were off to university. They found themselves wives, leaving us at home, on our own, wondering where all the years had gone. But still we felt young, still able to work and go on holiday.We hardly noticed our th birthdays, then last year it was the th wedding anniversary. We still have brothers and sisters and the only recognition of ageing is when the much older members in the wider family, the true older generation, pass on.
