Originally \u0027affodil\u0027, a word for the plant we now call asphodel. Colloquially known as jonquils — from the French \u0027jonquille\u0027, the colour yellow. William Wordsworth (of \u0027a host, of golden daffodils\u0027 fame) pronounced it \u0027junkwill\u0027. In folklore, if you deliberately avoid stepping on them, fortune will favour you. If you give someone a gift of daffodils, they, too, will have good luck — but a single flower means penury and ill-fortune.ERICA — From Latin and Greek meaning \u0027heath\u0027 — where these spring-flowering heathers grow. Summer-flowering heather that covers moors is Calluna (from the Greek meaning \u0027to beautify, sweep clean\u0027) or ling (from the old Norse word \u0027lyng\u0027). According to Richard Mabey\u0027s Flora Britannica, heather ale was once a staple in the Scottish Highlands and drunk from cattle horns.FOXGLOVE — The scientific name is Digitalis — because the flowers (right) can be put on a finger (digitus is Latin for \u0027finger\u0027) like a thimble. The puzzling part is \u0027fox\u0027 — unless it\u0027s because they grow in woods where foxes live.         A rose gets its name from the Greek \u0027kunorodon\u0027 and Latin Rosa canina, \u0027dog rose\u0027. The prickly species deter thieves, and have been given the mock Latin name burglaris disembowelisOr perhaps it\u0027s derived from \u0027folks\u0027 gloves\u0027. In parts of Scotland, it\u0027s \u0027tod-tail\u0027 (as \u0027tod\u0027 is a Scots word for fox). Other names: ladies\u0027 fingers, floppy dock, dead-men\u0027s bells and fairy gloves.Once widely used in folk medicine as, though highly poisonous, it can be turned into a drug that slows and strengthens the heart.GOOSEGRASS — Covered with tiny hooks that cling onto almost everything. Also known as Stickywilly, Velcro Plant and Cleavers. Botanically, Galium aparine means \u0027milk seizer\u0027 — from the Greek word meaning milk. Juice from a related plant was once used to curdle milk in cheese-making.Called Goosegrass because it\u0027s loved by geese — or Hedgeheriff, Grip Grass, Scratweed, Mutton Chops, Claggy Meggies, Robin-run-in-the-Grass, Loveman, Tongue Bleed and Everlasting Friendship.

Britain is home to half the world\u0027s population. But under threat from garden-escaped, paler, Spanish bluebell (Hyacinthoides hiica) with big concerns that hybridisation will dilute the gene pool of our pure, native bluebell and it could be lost for ever. Hyacinth is from the Greek youth Hyacinthus, killed accidentally by Apollo while being taught to throw the discus. Out of his blood grew the flower.IMPATIENS — Known as Busy Lizzies in gardens but as balsams in the wild. The word derives from the Latin \u0027impatiens\u0027 (impatient) after the tendency of the ripe seed-pods of some species to burst violently when touched. Seeds of the Himalayan balsam (whose leaves smell like Jeyes Fluid) can catapult 40ft away.JASMINE — From the Persian \u0027yasameen\u0027 (gift from God). Winter jasmine, which is flowering now, is Jasminum nudiflorum (which translates as \u0027naked flower\u0027)KNIPHOFIA — Commonly known as red-hot pokers but these African-originated plants were named after 18th-century German professor Johann Hieronymus Kniphof, who had a large botanical collection.

The tree was introduced to Europe from Japan in about 1709, while Magnol was alive, but the tree was not named until after his death.NARCISSUS — Daffodils and their relatives. Said to be linked to the Greek of the same name who starved to death because of his fixation with his own looks. The gods transformed him into a flower so he could remain for ever at the side of the stream where he admired his reflection. But this is not true. In Greek, \u0027narcissus\u0027 means \u0027numbness\u0027, so it\u0027s just a reference to the plant\u0027s narcotic nature.ORCHID — Name from the old Greek word for \u0027testicle\u0027 — because of the shape of many orchid roots. In Shetland, some call them Curly Doddies or Dog\u0027s Dubbles.POPPY — From the botanical name Papaver Rhoeas — \u0027papa\u0027 meaning \u0027thick milk\u0027 and a reference to its white sap Rhoeas is bastardised Greek for \u0027red\u0027, referring to the colour. Also, bledewort, redweed and thunder flower. When in good soil, one corn poppy can produce 800,000 tiny seeds.

In Shetland, some call them Curly Doddies or Dog\u0027s DubblesQUERCUS — The botanical word for the tree sacred to many gods. These include Zeus and Jupiter who both ruled over thunder and lightning — with oak trees prone to lightning strikes as they\u0027re often so tall. Quercin is a bitter alcohol obtained from the bark and acorns of oak.ROSE — Known to Shakespeare as sweet briar and eglantine. Mentioned by Oberon in A Midsummer Night\u0027s Dream: \u0027I know a bank . . . Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine, With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine. There sleeps Titania sometime of the night.\u0027 The name is from the Greek \u0027kunorodon\u0027 and Latin Rosa canina, \u0027dog rose\u0027. The prickly species deter thieves, and have been given the mock Latin name burglaris disembowelis.SALIX — The old Latin name for the willow from it comes salicylic acid, responsible for the anti-inflammatory action of aspirin. The name of the trees\u0027 catkins comes from Dutch \u0027katteken\u0027 (kitten). Willows are noted for their flexibility and graceful appearance, hence the adjective willowy.TULIP — From the Turkish pronunciation of the Persian word \u0027dulband\u0027 or turban, which the flowers resemble.         From the Latin \u0027anemone\u0027 and the Greek \u0027anemos\u0027 (wind or daughter of the wind). Alternatively the windflower, because the petals flutter in the breeze and open only when the wind blowsURTICA — The common name, Nettle, might have an ancient meaning \u0027to bind together\u0027 as nettle fibre was used for weaving. From the Latin for \u0027to burn\u0027, so linked with the stinging hairs. The word \u0027urticating\u0027 means \u0027stinging\u0027.VERONICA — Genus of plant that includes speedwells. Our name means just what it says — a fast-growing plant. Also because they are found beside roads and speed your journey. Named for St Veronica, who offered her cloth to Jesus. Other names: Eye Of The Child Jesus, Farewell, Goodbye and Cat\u0027s Eye (the pattern on the flower face).WALLFLOWER — An obvious name for Cheiranthus, plants that grow on walls also Gillyflowers and Milkmaids.XEROPHTE — A name for plants that grow in dry places, from the Greek for \u0027dry\u0027 — such as stonecrop and other Sedums.YARROW — Daisy-like, white or pale pink, with its name from Latin Achillea millefolium (\u0027thousand leaves\u0027). Greek hero Achilles\u0027 mother was said to have dipped his body in a tincture of the plant — except, fatally, his heel — in an attempt to make him invulnerable.

Anorexia would make you believe you are bigger than that … And Instagram reinforced that with the comments of “I feel so fat” all over those posts,’ she told the BBC.

File photograph: Dara Mac DónaillThe .A group representing members of the Defence Forces, pensioner members and their families is targeting local and European election candidates with a number of demands such as the restoration of austerity era cuts. The Defence Forces Family Political Forum is seeking to encourage strategic voting and says it is the first time the “military family” will have organised itself for voting purposes. It is claimed that there are between 200,000 and 250,000 serving and retired members of the permanent and reserve Defence Forces and their families. A forum set up last autumn in an attempt to influence how these people vote has now set out a list of four “asks” of political parties and candidates ahead of the May 24th elections. These are that military advice to the Government continues to be the “sole preserve” of the Defence Forces General Staff that all Defence Forces allowances are restored to pre-crash levels and that a standing commission to review pay levels for members be established and that the Defence Forces Chief of Staff takes over as accounting officer for defence budgets from the secretary general of the Department of Defence, as is currently the case. The last “ask” is that the Permanent Defence Forces be at least 10,500 strong at all times, the Army should be comprised of three brigades headquartered in Dublin, Cork and Athlone, and that a Reserve Defence Force with a “wide geographical spread” should be re-established.‘Targeted’Of the “four asks”, retired Brig Gen Ger Aherne said: “This is targeted at political parties, political groupings, and inidual candidates in the European and local elections.“If endorsed by them and included in their manifestos and literature we will inform the military family of whom is supporting us and... who is not.“Since the foundation of the State no political party has ever targeted the military family for support. Equally, the military family has never organised itself into a homogeneous group for voting purposes. This is now changing.” A ‘Respect and Loyalty Parade’ takes place in Cork on May 4th, three weeks out from the European and local elections.“While a major breakthrough on influencing the military family on strategic voting is a work in progress, it is felt that momentum in building, awareness of the perilous state of the Defence Forces is now widespread, and the military family will no longer tolerate political and institutional flattery but not respect,” retired Brg Gen Aherne said.

So far parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice. Motion after motion and amendment after amendment have been tabled without parliament ever deciding what it wants. All MPs have been willing to say is what they do not want,” she said.The UK prime minister was speaking after European Council president Donald Tusk said the EU could offer a short extension to the article 50 negotiating process on condition that MPs approve her Brexit deal next week.Mrs May will address the other 27 EU leaders at the start of today’s summit in Brussels before they make a decision on extending article 50.In a letter to Mr Tusk on Wednesday, the prime minister requested an extension until June 30th. She told MPs later that she could not consider a longer delay because that would require the UK to take part in European Parliament elections at the end of May.“What kind of message would that send? And just how bitter and isive would that election campaign be at a time when the country desperately needs bringing back together?” she said in her televised statement last night.“Some have suggested holding a second referendum. I don’t believe that is what you want – and it is not what I want. We asked you the question already and you gave us your answer.“Now you want us to get on with it. And that is what I am determined to do.”Strasbourg agreementsMr Tusk also said that the European Council should not have any problem ratifying the agreements made at Strasbourg last week between the EU and UK, on legal assurances about the functioning of the backstop.Mrs May said in her letter that the Strasbourg deal was important to her need to present a different version of the deal to allow it to be put to parliament again.Mr Tusk said that the conditional extension could be approved by “written procedure” at the end of next week, so not requiring the reconvening of the summit.But in the event the meaningful vote is not passed, it will probably be necessary to call the leaders together again next Thursday or Friday to consider any further request from Mrs May for either a short or long extension.The UK is due to leave the EU at 11pm on Friday, March 29th. Should Mrs May decide not to make a further extension request, the UK will leave on schedule on a no-deal basis.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar took a softer line to Mr Tusk, urging patience with Britain as as he warned of an accidental no-deal Brexit.“I think it’s time now to cut them some slack – to cut the British Government some slack when it comes to their request for an extension and when it comes to their request that the Strasbourg agreement be ratified formally by the European Council over the next two days.“So we’re willing to support both of those requests, but obviously we’re not entertaining any change to the withdrawal agreement or the backstop,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

MSF says it has found “alarming” rates of acute malnutrition in the centre in southeast TripoliChildren are among those severely malnourished at a detention centre in Libya, where hundreds of refugees and migrants have been locked up, many for more than six months, after they were intercepted trying to reach Europe.A report released on Thursday by medical organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which provides aid in multiple detention centres run by Libya’s department for combatting illegal migration (DCIM), says it has found “alarming” rates of acute malnutrition in Sabaa detention centre in southeast Tripoli.More than one-third of the 300 people imprisoned there are children under 18, who MSF says are “significantly” more likely to be malnourished.“What we see today in this single detention centre is symptomatic of an uncontrolled, unjustified and reckless system that puts the lives of refugees and migrants at risk,” said Karline Kleijer, MSF’s head of emergencies.“The fact that Europe, too, is contributing to this suffering through policies that enable people rescued at sea to be forcibly returned to inhumane detention conditions in Libya is utterly unconscionable.”About 5,700 refugees and migrants are currently held in DCIM-run detention centres, according to the United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR).The majority already tried to cross the Mediterranean, but were intercepted by the Libyan coast guard, which receives tens of millions of euro in support and training from the EU because of a policy aimed at stopping arrivals to Europe.No enough foodThe  has been in regular contact with dozens of detainees in Libya for the past seven months.All of them have spoken about not getting enough food. On good days they may get two portions of plain macaroni or pasta on bad days nothing.Often they have no idea when they will next be fed, either because guards say they have a lack of funding or want to punish them for protests or escape attempts.In Abu Salim detention centre, southern Tripoli, detainees say they have received almost no food since October, besides what they pay vastly inflated prices for themselves.In several centres detainees use hidden mobile phones to call family and ask them to send money. Though some share food, those without financial support are suffering badly, they said.“Here on this detention centre you get meals from your pocket cash. No money, no food to take,” one said.Detainees from countries including Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia say their families continue to beg or borrow, and sell property to support them, causing enormous stress.“They sell everything to save my life and even they get into debt to feed me,” said one Eritrean.DetaineesAnother estimated only 10 per cent of the food meant for detainees actually reaches them.“Do you think that European governments don’t know about this? They know but want to hide all dirty things about Libya.”DCIM did not respond to a request for comment.A spokesman for Department of Foreign Affairs said it was “deeply troubled by the grave human rights abuses that migrants and refugees suffer in Libya . . . Regrettably, political fragmentation and the fragile security situation in Libya limit the capacity of the international community to end these abuses.”While the EU’s Trust Fund for Africa was working on “improving conditions for detainees”, the spokesman said only “non-food items” were supported by EU funding.Read more on how Europe attempts to deal with the migrant crisis"},{"url":null,"title":"juxtaposed jigsaw art pictures","story":"Tim Klein, from Washington, USA, has been creating his surreal mash-ups from jigsaw puzzles since 1993.

The children, born last autumn, are thought to be the world\u0027s first gene-edited babies.The revelation took the world by surprise and was met with global condemnation. Medical ethics were breached because HIV can be treated without gene-editing and the risks that entails. Editing the genes of embryonic DNA may also have far reaching consequences as it alters the germline - meaning that the changes made are passed from one generation to another and cannot be undone.The panel, which included 18 researchers and bioethicists, said there is an “urgent need” to create a transparent global registry which lists all experiments related to human gene-editing, and asked the WHO to set up such a registry immediately. Dr Margaret Ann Hamburg, co-chair of the WHO panel, said the proposed registry - where scientific journals and funders would have to list anything they publish or finance - would “increase accountability of scientific researchers around the world.”The database should include studies that edit the DNA of eggs, sperm and early embryos, but should also include those that edit adult cells to curtail disease - which is far less controversial.The panel added that over the next two years it aims to produce “comprehensive governance framework” for work in the field, to help prevent maverick uses of the developing technology. But the panel stopped short of proposing a moratorium on germline gene-editing, which was called for by an international group of scientists in an article in Nature journal last week. I don\u0027t think a vague moratorium is the answer to what needs to be done, said Dr Hamburg. What we\u0027re trying to do is look at the broad picture.But Dr Hamburg also said: “The committee agrees that it is irresponsible at this time for anyone to proceed with clinical applications of human germline genome editing.Newsletter promotion - global health security - end of articleLong-term ethical concern and debate around germline editing revolves around the creation of “designer babies” - embryos modified not just to protect against disease but to produce children with enhanced intelligence, athletic prowess or cosmetic traits. Stephen Hawking’s final prediction, in an essay published after his death, was that the wealthiest strata of society would soon begin editing their own and their children’s DNA to create a ‘superhuman’ race, with enhanced memory, disease resistance, intelligence and longevity.He argued this risked iding humanity into genetic ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’.But in an interview in last week\u0027s  George Church, professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, said the controversy surrounding the editing of human embryos was overblown. He compared the debate to the short lived moral panic that proceeded the introduction of IVF treatment, predicting that germline editing would eventually be “adopted worldwide”. He did add, however, that there were legitimate concerns about the technology exacerbating inequalities.The WHO’s director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus , welcomed the panel’s proposals. “Gene editing holds incredible promise for health, but it also poses some risks, both ethically and medically,” he said.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security What next for Brexit?

According to the British Museum, you may have it all wrong.Many people believe it shows a man screaming. Not so, says the museum, which is about to display a black and white print of the image.“This rare version of the Scream that we’re display at the British Museum makes clear that Munch’s most famous artwork depicts a person hearing a ‘scream’ and not, as many people continue to assume and debate, a person screaming,” said Giulia Bartrum, curator of a forthcoming exhibition devoted to the Norwegian artist.The lithograph, unlike the coloured works, features an inscription by Munch that reads: “I felt the great scream throughout nature.”It is a reference to his inspiration for the painting. Munch was walking by a fjord overlooking Oslo in 1892 when the sky turned blood red, a sight that had a profound effect upon him.“Munch very deliberately included the caption on this version to describe how his inspiration came from the anxiety he suddenly felt.“He was trying to capture an emotion or moment in time. Through the inscription we know how he felt. People think this is a screaming person but that’s not what is going on.“It is a man hearing, whether in his head or not. He feels the sensation of nature screaming all around him.“I have no doubt that this iconic figure is reacting to nature’s external forces on that hillside. What can still be debated is whether, for Munch, those forces were real or psychological.”The coloured version of the painting are the most well-knownThe issue of whether the figure is screaming or listening has been alive for decades. The former director of the Munch Museum in Oslo, Gunnar Soerensen, has said: “It could be a scream in nature or a person screaming. It is a question of interpretation.”But Mr Soerensen’s successor, Stein Olav Henrichsen, said the British Museum has it right. “There are lots of comments on this work, but we have Munch’s own words and this is someone covering their ears as they hear nature screaming.“But we do not mind at all if people interpret it in different ways. During the Cold War, Time magazine put the Scream on the front page as a comment on the era and the atomic bomb.“We have heard that some English people are using it for Brexit. People can interpret and enjoy art in different ways, he told the .Edvard Munch: love and angst, which runs at the British Museum from April 11 - July 21, will be the largest exhibition of the artist’s prints in the UK for 45 years. It includes nearly 50 loans from the Munch Museum.The Scream is the highlight - the black and white print was disseminated widely in Munch’s lifetime and made him famous. The monochrome treatment emphasises the wavy lines in the sky that “give the sensation of a tuning fork resonating around the figure”, Ms Bartrum said. “When you look at it, you can almost hear a sound.”The Scream is one of the most recognisable artworks in the world because it has “a simplicity and an immediate impact for everybody, wherever you come from,” she added.What next for Brexit?

The index is a measure of inflation calculated by tracking the price of a selected basket of goods and services.Beer prices rose 0.6 per cent\u0026nbspbetween January and February compared with a decline of 1.1 per cent\u0026nbsplast year. Annually, food and alcohol inflation hit 1.1 per cent\u0026nbspand 5.1 per cent\u0026nbsprespectively.The price of food was up 0.4 per cent between January and February compared with 0.1 per cent last year. Alcohol and tobacco were up\u0026nbsp0.9 per cent increase on the month versus flat prices in February 2018.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said: “While February’s rise in inflation may be marginally disappointing for consumer purchasing power, it is still looking appreciably better than in mid-2018 – especially as earnings growth retained its firmer tone in January. Real earnings growth is currently 1.5 per cent, the best level since end-2016, although still appreciably below longterm norms.”Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersHe added that different Brexit outcomes were likely to affect CPI in the coming months.He said: “Our suspicion is that inflation will spike significantly higher if the UK leaves the EU without a deal,\u0026nbspprimarily due to a likely marked fall in sterling – even though the government has indicated that under a temporary scheme, 87 per cent\u0026nbspof imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access compared to 80 per cent\u0026nbspof imports currently being tariff-free.”Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “The rate of inflation is stable, with a modest rise in food as well as alcohol and tobacco offset by clothing and footwear prices rising by less than they did a year ago.”Upward pressure also came from recreation and culture, as prices rose between January and February 2019 compared with a smaller rise between the same two months last year. Computer games had the biggest effect.But clothing and footwear prices had a downward effect. Although pricetags were higher in February as usual, following the January sales, the increase was smaller than the same period last year.Annually, clothing and footwear prices dropped 2 per cent.At the pumps, motorists saw lower fuel costs last month, as petrol fell by 0.5p per litre on the month to 119.1p. Diesel also fell by 0.2p to 129.3p.The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, was 2.4 per cent, down from 2.5 per cent\u0026nbspin January. It is the lowest since October 2016, when it was 2.2 per cent.It comes ahead of the Bank of England’s interest rate decision on Thursday, when the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.KPMG UK’s chief economist Yael Selfin said the central bank may need to act more aggressively in future.She said: “Our expectations are for inflation to average around the Bank of England’s 2 per cent\u0026nbsptarget this year but to rise further in 2020, putting pressure on them to act more aggressively than markets currently anticipate.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.220 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience.

The Bird Box world is Malorie’s story, and I wanted to know more about her. I wanted to get to know her even better.”Bird Box\u0026nbspcame out on Netflix in December last year and, according to Netflix, was watched by 80 million households in the four weeks following its release.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

On 29\u0026nbspMarch, the UK will simply cease to be a member of the EU if a Withdrawal Agreement or an extension to Article 50 is not agreed.One of the main changes that would immediately result on this day is that the UK will need to apply its own tariff rates on its imports. It will not be bound by the EU\u0027s common external tariffs. It will also not be eligible for zero tariffs on exports to the EU. And, it will lose the benefits of almost all of the EU’s trade agreements, which cover 82 countries. To date, just seven of these trade agreements have been converted into continuity agreements, and none of these are with a major trade partner of the UK.\u0026nbspThe government has announced that, in the case of no deal, it will eliminate tariffs on 87 per cent of imports but introduce tariffs in key sectors including cars, ceramics and key meat products. The Cabinet has been ided over its tariff policy, with Michael Gove reportedly pursuing high tariffs, at least on agriculture, and Phillip Hammond preferring to opt for lower rates. Meanwhile, Liam Fox has floated the idea of unilaterally dropping all tariffs to zero.\u0026nbspFor many products, there is actually very little flexibility. Politics aside, the economic reality is that the maximum tariffs that can be set for any product will be determined by the “bound rates” that the UK already has in place under the WTO.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersMembers of the WTO negotiate over the maximum tariffs that governments can apply and these rates must be the same for imports from all countries, with the exception of developing countries and certain trade partners with who there is a comprehensive trade agreement in place. Successive rounds of WTO negotiations have led to low maximum tariff rates on a lot of goods.The average tariff that the UK charges to WTO members is under 3 per cent. But the average rate masks a number of tariff peaks, notably for agricultural products, textiles and apparel, leather products and automobiles, where the government, if they so wish, has a lot more room to deviate from the current EU tariff policy. \u0026nbspThe government faces a trade-off when choosing tariffs: high tariffs will mean higher prices to consumers, no matter whether they buy from the EU or from the rest of the world, as the UK will have to charge the same tariffs to all WTO members under no deal.Low tariffs will expose UK producers to greater import competition and will result in reduced bargaining power in future trade negotiations. The example of food imports illustrates this trade-off. Tariffs\u0026nbspon meat can be as high as 84 per cent, dairy produce up to 74 per cent and grains 63 per cent.At the moment, 71 per cent of UK\u0027s agricultural imports come in duty free from the EU, while the rest face these high tariffs. Jacob Rees-Mogg sees Brexit as a chance to break away from the “protectionist racket” of the EU and extend zero tariffs to all imports so that British consumers can enjoy lots of juicy, perhaps hormone-fed, Australian beef. Michael Gove wants to keep beef tariffs high to protect UK farmers from import competition.\u0026nbspLive: Theresa May caves to Brexiteers with request for short delayThe government’s plan is to place food items that are not produced in the UK (like oranges and sugar) on the zero tariff list and food items, like beef and lamb, that are produced in the UK on the sensitive list with tariffs. This is a sensible approach to account for consumer and producer interests - get rid of unnecessary costs to consumers where possible and try to protect domestic producers from import competition where desirable.While this logic seems sensible for unilateral trade policy actions, it overlooks the fact that tariff peaks mostly remain in sectors where trade partners are reluctant to open up their economies to imports. Take cars for instance. Most developed countries protect their auto industry, arguably because of the value addition, research and development and the high quality of jobs that it provides.Under no deal, the UK will impose a 10 per cent tariff on cars – the same rate currently applied by the EU to external countries - to protect the domestic auto industry. But that\u0027s just not going to be significant enough to help the UK car industry during a time when its exports start to incur tariffs in their biggest export destination - the EU.In fact, the most comprehensive study on the projected impacts of no deal on the UK car industry suggests a 12 per cent reduction in UK car production, because the rise in domestic sales would hardly make up for the loss in sales from increased trade barriers in UK\u0027s export markets.\u0026nbspUnilateral trade policy actions are limited in terms of what they can achieve. That\u0027s the reason trade agreements exist – they enable countries to reduce trade barriers and encourage mutual economic activity by providing reciprocal market access to each other.Government plan to axe no deal tariffs savaged by all and no wonderBrexit plan to slash tariffs after no deal condemned as \u0027madness\u0027Tariffs to be scrapped on most imports after no-deal BrexitPlans to scrap import tariffs after no-deal Brexit to be kept secretThe EU-Canada trade deal does exactly that in the auto sector – both sides made concessions to each other by lowering tariffs and reducing costs arising from regulatory ergence between them.\u0026nbspGovernments rarely eliminate all tariffs unilaterally because tariffs are important bargaining chips in trade negotiations to get market access concessions from trade partners in the same or other areas.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspUltimately, while the government\u0027s proposed principle of managing consumer and producer interests appears sound, it begs the same question that many have been wondering since the run-up to the referendum. Is all this tinkering over little margins of adjustment on unilateral trade policy worth the loss of deep market access with the world\u0027s largest trading bloc and the clout that goes with it in third country trade negotiations?The actual performance of the economy since the Brexit referendum suggests \u0027no\u0027. The UK is now one of slowest growing OECD countries. Sterling has depreciated massively and remains low.\u0026nbsp This has already made imports more expensive, especially intermediate inputs, and there has been no export boom. New research shows workers have already borne the brunt of this.As the UK\u0027s place in global value chains has become more precarious, workers have seen slower wage growth and cutbacks in job-related education and training. This does not augur well for future productivity.\u0026nbspMuch time has been spent over tariffs and this has taken away from the bigger question of weak productivity and low real wage growth in the UK. Services, which have no tariffs, are key to this as they employ 80 per cent of the UK\u0027s workforce. The scale of the costs from no deal in services and related activities could be large.The EU is a crucial market for UK services and getting access to third markets in these sectors is even more fraught with concerns over sovereignty and quality standards. Except sectors like finance which have the clout to get special deals, much of the UK economy will have to pay a hefty cost under no deal, which could result in long-term reductions in GDP.Dr Swati Dhingra is a research leader for The UK in a Changing Europe, Associate Professor, Department of Economics and Research Associate, Centre for Economic Performance at LSE.

Kingfisher sales rise to £3bn thanks to strong performance at ScrewfixKingfisher enters DIY expansion war with £500m turnaround planThe company’s troubled French arm, Castorama, is still wilting. B\u0026ampQ isn’t doing well either, leaving the group even more dependent on Screwfix, the trade arm that’s been propping things up.\u0026nbspWe are told the “engine” that will spark the group into life is now nearly in place. It’s going to have to go some to instil any confidence\u0026nbspthat this is a business heading in the right direction.\u0026nbspChair Andy Cosslett paid gushing tribute to “Vero”, who is just the most senior of a string of top executives walking out of what has become a rapidly revolving door at the entrance\u0026nbspof the executive suite.Another, Steve Willett, the chief transformation and digital officer, announced his departure alongside that of Laury. She at least looks set to be with the business for some time to come because no date has been set for her exit and she says she’s\u0026nbspgoing to stick around until there’s a replacement.Meanwhile the calls for a change in strategy to go with changes in personnel are only going to grow louder, regardless of Cosslett’s insistence that the change at the top “won’t slow us down or deflate us from our strategy”.Laury going\u0026nbspwon’t buy off Kingfisher’s critics, many of whom have been calling for a breakup. It will give added ammunition to the critics of the FTSE 100’s hiring practices.\u0026nbspLaury may have disappointed her investors, but that doesn’t make her unique in an index that already has more Davids or Daves (seven) than it has women at the top.\u0026nbspWhen she’s gone there will be just five.Created with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

There\u0027s a reason its rivals have opted to take their regulatory medicine. It really isn’t doing itself any favours by engaging in a fight like this.\u0026nbspAnother problem with the attention that has been given to the company, and its business practices, is that it’s rather detracted form the other important points the committee has made about live music, which makes a hugely important contribution to the UK’s cultural and its economic life.\u0026nbspIt is an industry that employs 28,000 people, and generated almost £1n in terms of gross value added in 2017, a year in which 29.1m people attended concerns and festivals in the UK.\u0026nbspLooked at in those terms, it is a stunning success. But all is not rosy in its garden and its problems go far beyond people buying tickets from secondary websites and getting fleeced.\u0026nbspThe report highlights numerous issues. Venues have been closing, especially smaller ones. The way in which the benefits of live music are shared around the country is distinctly uneven. In terms of gross spend, for example, the North East generated £51m, compared to £194m in the Midlands, compared to more than £1bn in London.\u0026nbspDespite this the capital has fewer arenas per person than do other major cities and one witnessed stated that it is “trending down” with respect to its international rivals.\u0026nbspThe industry is dogged by competition issues and conflicts of interests that Tom Gray, from the band Gomez, pointed out “would not be tolerated in any other industry”.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Business news: in pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.110 No deal, no tariffsThe government has announced that it would slash almost all tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

The index is a measure of inflation calculated by tracking the price of a selected basket of goods and services.Beer prices rose 0.6 per cent\u0026nbspbetween January and February compared with a decline of 1.1 per cent\u0026nbsplast year. Annually, food and alcohol inflation hit 1.1 per cent\u0026nbspand 5.1 per cent\u0026nbsprespectively.The price of food was up 0.4 per cent between January and February compared with 0.1 per cent last year. Alcohol and tobacco were up\u0026nbsp0.9 per cent increase on the month versus flat prices in February 2018.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY Item Club, said: “While February’s rise in inflation may be marginally disappointing for consumer purchasing power, it is still looking appreciably better than in mid-2018 – especially as earnings growth retained its firmer tone in January. Real earnings growth is currently 1.5 per cent, the best level since end-2016, although still appreciably below longterm norms.”Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersHe added that different Brexit outcomes were likely to affect CPI in the coming months.He said: “Our suspicion is that inflation will spike significantly higher if the UK leaves the EU without a deal,\u0026nbspprimarily due to a likely marked fall in sterling – even though the government has indicated that under a temporary scheme, 87 per cent\u0026nbspof imports by value would be eligible for zero-tariff access compared to 80 per cent\u0026nbspof imports currently being tariff-free.”Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “The rate of inflation is stable, with a modest rise in food as well as alcohol and tobacco offset by clothing and footwear prices rising by less than they did a year ago.”Upward pressure also came from recreation and culture, as prices rose between January and February 2019 compared with a smaller rise between the same two months last year. Computer games had the biggest effect.But clothing and footwear prices had a downward effect. Although pricetags were higher in February as usual, following the January sales, the increase was smaller than the same period last year.Annually, clothing and footwear prices dropped 2 per cent.At the pumps, motorists saw lower fuel costs last month, as petrol fell by 0.5p per litre on the month to 119.1p. Diesel also fell by 0.2p to 129.3p.The Retail Prices Index (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, was 2.4 per cent, down from 2.5 per cent\u0026nbspin January. It is the lowest since October 2016, when it was 2.2 per cent.It comes ahead of the Bank of England’s interest rate decision on Thursday, when the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is widely expected to leave rates unchanged at 0.75 per cent.KPMG UK’s chief economist Yael Selfin said the central bank may need to act more aggressively in future.She said: “Our expectations are for inflation to average around the Bank of England’s 2 per cent\u0026nbsptarget this year but to rise further in 2020, putting pressure on them to act more aggressively than markets currently anticipate.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Then on 25 October a cow fell ill on a farm near the market town of Oswestry in Shropshire.That was the beginning of an epidemic that only ended five months later, with the farming business on its knees and huge areas of the country covered by overlapping five-mile exclusion zones.A total of 442,000 animals had been slaughtered in 2,364 separate outbreaks. Roughly £150m\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspa huge amount at the time –\u0026nbspwas spent on slaughter costs and lost sales farmers received £27m in compensation.It became known as the Great Cattle Plague, and even today it is still the subject of angry discussion in rural circles.As outbreaks popped up around the country, triggered by the combination of the virus’s 14-day incubation period and its extreme infectiousness, the Ministry of Agriculture began imposing five-mile exclusion zones as new infections were identified animals could not be moved in or out.Created with Sketch.Looking back at Britain’s foot-and-mouth outbreaks: 1927-1967 Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Two farmworkers read a notice declaring a footpath closed because of foot-and-mouthA man hoses down a car at Cockernach Farm, Barkway,  Hertfordshire, in an attempt to contain the spread of foot-and-mouth.

Entrances to fields and farms were blocked with disinfected straw members of the public were not allowed to enter them.Humans are usually safe from the disease, but at least one person died from the epidemic some of the worst outbreaks were in Cheshire, Shropshire and Wales.The disease was later reckoned to have been virtually eradicated throughout the European Union after a campaign of vaccination and slaughter. That makes yesterday’s action, in which the EU banned all meat, milk and livestock exports from the UK, understandable.After slaughter, farms had to be scrubbed twice a day with special disinfectant and animals were not allowed on to the land for at least six months. Restricted entry signs stood over the entrance to farmland, bearing warnings including: “You are now entering an infected area.”Horse racing was suspended in Britain after the 1967 outbreak and the official Shrovetide football game in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, was cancelled in 1968 because of continuing restrictions.The outbreak was finally linked to frozen lamb carcasses imported from Argentina.Although Britain did suffer another foot-and-mouth outbreak in 1981 on the Isle of Wight, it was easily isolated. A total of 200 cattle and 369 pigs were destroyed.This article first appeared in The Independent on 22 February 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

In nine days, Scottish farmers and dealers reach the more important deadline when they can apply for a resumption of overseas exports, because then they will have been free of the disease for 90 days.The auction at Kirkwall, capital of the Orkneys six miles off the mainland, was seen as a trial run for the resumption of trade in other unaffected areas of the United Kingdom.Though no more than two dozen buyers, many of them mainland farmers from Aberdeenshire, made the ferry trip for yesterday’s sale, only auction and government veterinary officials, and representatives from the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, were allowed close contact with the livestock. The buyers, dressed from head-to-toe in hats, clean boiler suits, rubber boots and white plastic raincoats, had to forgo the usual close inspections of the cattle before the sale began.For the Orcadians, the resumption of the weekly cattle mart was more than just a lifeline for business. The social effect of the closure has been devastating.

There’s much still to do to get out of the mess that foot-and-mouth has caused and get the farmers back to a kind of normality.”Steven Metcalf, chairman of Orkney Auction Mart, said: “The social effect of the mart reopening is good news. Early in the outbreak people were frightened to move around and weren’t visiting neighbours or friends. It is a good boost for the morale of agriculture and it is a step nearer to normal trading and normal life.”Although the slaughter of more than 800,000 animals north of the border has so far limited the number of confirmed cases to 187, Maria Limonci, spokeswoman for the NFUS, said Scottish farmers needed to see export bans lifted. “Around 40 per cent of the sheep produced in Scotland usually go out of the country and at present they have nowhere to go,” she said. “More farmers deal in sheep than cattle, and this was only one sale. It’s a huge step in the right direction but it doesn’t mean things are now OK.“We have to hope nothing goes wrong in next few days. Having 90 clear days would give Scotland grounds to put forward the proposal to Europe to allow exports to restart.”In England, continuing restrictions prompted 600 farmers yesterday to demand a public inquiry into the handling of the crisis.David Handley, head of the pressure group Farmers For Action who spearheaded last year’s fuel blockade, led a protest march from Hyde Park to Downing Street to hand in a petition condemning the government’s policy on dealing with the crisis and the failure to implement a vaccination strategy to prevent the spread of the disease.Although the turnout was lower than expected, protesters included farmers from foot-and-mouth hotspots in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon and Cornwall.Up to 3,000 civil servants at the Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs held a one-day strike on 20 August 2001 over pay inequalities that followed formation of the new departmentThis article first appeared in The Independent on 21 August 2001We’ll tell you what’s true.

Nor is the belief that it remains one even now. Knowledgeable historians calculated that it was once the greatest empire in human history, if one takes into account both the territory it controlled and the time its\u0026nbspdomination lasted.\u0026nbspAdventurous political analysts have argued that in recent times Russia is inclined to regain its imperial powers. As Zbigniew Brzesinski, the former\u0026nbspnational security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, put it in 1997: “without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire … however, if Moscow regains control over Ukraine, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, ning Europe and Asia.”\u0026nbspThe annexation of Crimea is apparent evidence of this process.Yet many observers believe the present “empire” (ie the Russian Federation) might itself collapse once more, dissolving into different parts. Some politicians hope that it will.Very few, however, attempt to understand the nature of the Russian imperial project – and the similarities and differences between the Russian empire and the other European ones.The most striking similarity between the Russian and the western imperial histories – the one that is arguably critical to any European adventure of the kind – is the fact that they were clearly ided into two discrete, consecutive phases.\u0026nbspWhat the Roman empire can tell us about modern middle eastThe first was the period of settler colonisation, by which the applicable imperial power subjugates great landmasses either on its own continent or overseas, and relocates there significant numbers of people, to the point they are able to outnumber the indigenous tribes. This was the case for the Russians in Siberia, for the French in Louisiana and Canada, for the British in the Thirteen Colonies, Australia and New Zealand, as well as, in some senses, for the Spanish in Latin America.\u0026nbspAll these appropriations were made between the early 16th and mid-18th centuries and resulted in what Angus Maddison called “the western offshoots”.\u0026nbspThe second phase involved more straightforward military conquest this tended to see locals being dominated by relatively small regular armies and a complicated system of vassalage (like in the case of the British Raj in India). Here Russia followed the western path as well: just as the French conquered Indochina and west Africa and the British took huge parts of Asia, from modern Pakistan to Malaya, and of Africa, from Kenya to Rhodesia, so the Russians added to their empire both the Caucasus and parts of central Asia, confronting the British during the Pandjeh incident of 1885.In both phases, Russia was as European in its behaviour as either Great Britain or France: it built its empire directed by European logic and using European means of communication and warfare. Nevertheless, between the western method and the Russian approach there was one huge difference.Created with Sketch.Protests break out after Russia seize Ukraine warships Show all 32Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Activists of opposition parties burn flares during a rally demanding to break an agreement with Russia on the use of the Azov Sea and the Kerch Strait, in front of the parliament building in KievVolunteers with the right-wing paramilitary Azov National Corps light flares during a rally on the snowy streets in front of the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev after Russia seized two of their armored artillery vessels and a tug boat in the Black SeaUkrainian Nationalists demand to break the diplomatic relations with Russia and nationalization of Russian property in UkraineUkrainian activists burn flares during their rally in front of Russian Consulate in KharkivSeized Ukrainian ships, small armoured artillery ships and a tug boat, are seen anchored in a port of KerchThe President of Ukraine, Petro Poroshenko, announced, on 25 November, at a meeting of the National Security and Defense Council that they will introduce martial law in Ukraine for a period of 60 days and appeal to the Parliament to consider the moveRussia seized two small-sized \u0027Berdiansk\u0027 and \u0027Nikopol\u0027 armored artillery boats.

This forced the colonial powers to turn to military force effectively to create new, second empires – usually in different places.\u0026nbspIn Russia’s empire, meanwhile, neither its Siberian provinces nor the newly “reconciled” lands of today’s Ukraine and Belarus tried to secede.\u0026nbspTherefore, while Britain and France in fact possessed two different empires each, consecutively, the first and the second Russian empires (the first achieved through settler colonisation, the second through military action) were simply added to one another, rather like the traditional Russian matryoshka doll.\u0026nbspThis key difference between the imperial histories of Russia and the west helps to explain how the European powers have ended up where they are today.In particular, let’s consider the dissolution of the Soviet Union. With some minor exceptions, the borders of Russia now resemble those that existed in the mid-17th century, the time when the first empires of both Russia and the west powers were almost complete. Therefore, I would argue that the fall of the USSR was broadly the same process which evolved on a global scale between the end of the Second World War and the early 1970s and which is widely known as “decolonisation”\u0026nbsp(I dislike the word because I believe the European overseas appropriations of the time were not colonies, but rather military controlled possessions).\u0026nbspBut whereas this process ultimately left countries like Britain and France without empires at all, today’s Russia lost only its second – by retaining its first, it never lost its ambition for future re-expansion.For political elites in Russia and Ukraine, war still makes senseHere we should return to history.\u0026nbspThe Russian and the western empires were similar as it comes to the timings of their creation and to the methods of their construction – but they differ from each other in terms of the actors that stood behind the process.In western Europe the major nations (kingdoms then of course) had gained a clear national identity before they started their colonial adventures. Portugal, the oldest European nation state, fully sovereign since 1143, was the first to launch its overseas expansion. France emerged in full grandeur after peace with Britain in 1453 and the defeat of Burgundy in 1482 Spain became united in 1469 and Britain itself evolved as a single state after England was joined by Scotland and Ireland under James I in 1603.\u0026nbspWe can see this period as pre-imperial. By the time the Portuguese, the Spanish, the French, and the British sought to expand overseas, their own national unity was beyond question. This meant that when their first empires dissolved towards the end of the 18th and beginning of the 19th centuries, little damage was done to the sense of national identity of the imperial bases. As a consequence, the later, “second” empires appeared in the same sense British and French, as were the earlier ones.Contemporary Russia remains and will remain an empire since it simply has no place to retreat toIn Russia, things followed a different path. Moscow, a small settlement at the time when the Kievan Rus’ (the medieval alliance of Slavic and Finnic groups) reached its apex in the 11th and 12th centuries, became stronger when the separated Russian princedoms fought for their liberation from the Mongols.\u0026nbspTill that time, the vast country we call Russia today was united not so much by national or even quasi-national identity, as by its Orthodox faith as well as by the belief that it had become the beacon of the “true” Christian faith after the fall of Constantinople.\u0026nbspThe Muscovites overthrew the Mongol domination in 1480 and less than a century later ruined the Mongol khanates in the Volga region and started their expansion to the east. It took them another 100\u0026nbspyears to reach the Pacific shores – but in the west they weren’t able to advance further than the current border between Russia and Belarus.\u0026nbsp“Russia” as the country’s name became widespread in the mid-17th century as all the three major centres of Russian statehood – Novgorod, Kiev and Vladimir – started to be governed from Moscow. But the key point about this development is that the Russian state emerged as an empire, was administered as an empire, and possessed many other imperial elements. In other words, Russia itself arose as an empire – built not by Russia, but rather by Muscovy. Therefore the first Russian empire was actually the empire of Moscow, and not the empire of Russia.The Muscovy-built empire called Russia consolidated itself during the 17th and 18th century, strengthening its domination both in its settler colonies in the east and in the “original” “Russian” lands in the west.\u0026nbspOnly as this consolidation process was actually completed did Russia begin\u0026nbspto conquer militarily neighbouring lands – from Finland in the North to the Caucasus in the south from Poland in the west to Bukhara and Kokand in the southeast.\u0026nbspAs such, the second Russian empire became an empire built by Russia, not Muscovy and in a self-fulfilling cycle, bolstered the sense of a “Russian” national identity.\u0026nbspThe imperial core of all the western European examples remained the same from beginning to end (Britain, France, Spain etc) in the Russian case, it changed from Muscovy to Russia. Therefore, in the 20th century it was not only Stalin’s will that ided the Soviet Union into different “Socialist Republics”, but rather Russia’s entire history. The vast “country” of the USSR consisted of the Russian republic, which had boundaries similar to the first Russian empire, and all the other republics which replicated the second Russian empire’s military possessions.\u0026nbspIt should be noted that while in the USSR-era Russian republic Russians themselves accounted for 81.5 per cent of the population according to the 1989 census. In none of the other Soviet republics did they make even a simple majority.\u0026nbspThis history and these demographics were the two major factors that made the Soviet Union ready for speedy disintegration after 1989.From all this, three crucial conclusions can be drawn.First, contemporary Russia remains and will remain an empire since it simply has no place to retreat to. As Russia lost its possessions in 1991 it returned to an entity territorially similar to one that started the last wave of expansion in the late 18th century.\u0026nbspOn the face of it, it looks like all the other European empires which, during the “decolonisation” of the 20th century were pushed back to those territorial limits from which they began. But while the western imperial cores were and always had been nation states, (some of them democracies and even republics), Russia was itself an empire when it started to expand two and a half centuries ago.\u0026nbspA socially acceptable form of murderRussia detains two US Mormons as tensions flare US generals ‘thinking about possibility of nuclear war’Russia orders all orcas and belugas kept in \u0027whale prison\u0027 be set freeThe Russians are European people who share the major European values and principles – but nevertheless Russia as a country arose not as a nation based on these values but as an empire driven by a thirst for power and expansion.\u0026nbspIf a nation state builds an empire and fails, it comes back to being a (hopefully better) nation state, one which transcends imperial aspirations. But if an empire constructs an even bigger empire and fails, it reemerges as an offended, revanchist and aggressive empire – exactly as Russia now looks like.The second I draw is that we should not expect Russia to fall apart, as many current observers suggest. Even though the country remains multiethnic, the Russians make up the majority of the population in almost every part of the country. I cannot think of any cases in which truly consolidated, culturally homogenous country collapses and is ided into parts unless as the result of a war (a prospect for which there are no markers).\u0026nbspInstances of countries existing as ided entities but being inhabited by the same ethnic group or people were all caused by military conflicts (East and West Germany, South and North Korea, North\u0026nbspand South\u0026nbspVietnam, continental China and Taiwan).\u0026nbspNo foreign force could at present defeat Russia militarily and cut it into parts moreover, the fear of external powers is so huge in today’s Russia that those parts of the country that used to have some inclination for greater autonomy (like\u0026nbspeastern Siberia or the far\u0026nbspeast), no longer do.\u0026nbspAnxiety in those areas about the growing influence of China outweighs any concerns about growing pressure from and “exploitation” by the (imperial) centre. As Russia becomes weaker in the economic and political sense, any outsider hopes for its dismemberment actually fade.The final conclusion is the most important and it is this. There is, despite everything, a crucial weakness in the existing political construct of the Russian “Federation”. Inside this federation there are still several regions that look completely alien to it – those that were acquired not during the first wave of empire-building but during the second.\u0026nbspThese territories are the entire north Caucasus, which was attached to Russia as a result of bloody wars in the mid-19th century, and the Republic of Tuva at the border with Mongolia that first became part of the Soviet Union in 1944. The north Causasus lands are by no means “Russian”: today the complete share of the ethnic Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian population in the “Russian” republic of Ingushetia is a mere 0.9 per cent. Compare this with\u0026nbspremote Kyrgyzstan, a sovereign nation in central Asia, where it accounts for close to 6 per cent.\u0026nbspThese parts of the current Russia are elements of the second empire which were incorporated into the first one due to a historical mistake. Things were nearly different: in early 1990s, as Chechnya revolted against the Russian rule, it was thought other regional republics were ready to follow – but it never happened. \u0026nbspNow, Russia claims it “re-established” its control over its former military possessions, although in reality it pays countless tribute to local “khans” and “emirs”. In the end though, these remnants of the second Russia empire will surely secede at some stage.\u0026nbspIn sum then, Russia is a unique creature: not so much superior to other European empires, but drastically different from them. These differences shouldn’t be either neglected or denied one should look on the country sine ira et studio for exploring its European nature and history and for understanding what might be expected from it in the future.\u0026nbspRussia is the last existing empire – and an empire that lasts, if not forever, than for longer than its western equivalents. It should not be criticised for this, but explored and investigated.Vladislav Inozemtsev’s new book, with Alexander Abalov, is ‘The Last Empire’, published\u0026nbspin Russian\u0026nbspby Alpina Publishing House.

It is able to identify different facial features, as well as glasses, clothing, makeup and facial hair.Up until now, Face ID has struggled to differentiate between identical twins, though Apple claims it is still significantly more advanced than its Touch ID fingerprint scanner.The creating and storing of facial maps have inevitably led to concerns from privacy advocates, who worry about the implications if such data was accidentally leaked and fell into the hands of malicious actors.“I think we should be quite worried,” Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspwhen the technology was first announced.“The chances we are going to see mischief around facial data is pretty high – if not today, then soon, and if not on Apple then on Android.”It is not clear whether Apple plans to introduce the new subepidermal\u0026nbsptechnology to Face ID in its 2019 range of iPhones and iPads, as the company\u0026nbspdoes not comment on rumours surrounding forthcoming products.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

How the cue is interpreted once the signals reach the brain depends on the kind of animal doing the hearing.Studies of birds have previously shown they have exceptionally well-developed neural maps – brain passageways which chart the locations of sounds. It is also known that mammals use a different system, but little was known about how alligators pinpointed sounds.Created with Sketch.Dinosaurs in the Wild  Show all 18Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Dinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildPrevious studies examining animals’ hearing capabilities have often focused on skull-shapes and size, but scientists Catherine Carr, a professor of biology at the University of Maryland, and her colleague Lutz Kettler from the Technische Universität München, focused on evolutionary relationships between groups of species.Birds have very small head sizes compared with alligators, but the two groups share a common ancestor – the archosaur – which predates dinosaurs. Archosaurs began to emerge around 246 million years ago and split into two lineages – one that led to alligators and one that led to dinosaurs. Volcanoes may have wiped out dinosaurs before asteroid arrivedTiny T rex: Ancestor to the king of the dinosaurs discoveredNumber of asteroids pummelling Earth shoots up since age of dinosaursFossil of gigantic ‘mammal-like’ reptile discovered in PolandAlthough most dinosaurs died out during the mass extinction event 66 million years ago, some survived to evolve into modern birds.Professor Carr and Dr Kettler’s findings indicate the hearing strategy birds and alligators share may have less to do with head size and more to do with common ancestry.“Our research strongly suggests that this particular hearing strategy first evolved in their common ancestor,” Professor Carr said. “The other option, that they independently evolved the same complex strategy, seems very unlikely.”To study how alligators identify where sound comes from, the researchers anesthetised 40 American alligators with ketamine injections and fitted them with earphones. They played tones for the reptiles and measured the response of a structure in their brain stems called the nucleus laminaris. This structure is the core area of auditory signal processing. Octopuses given ecstasy by scientists become more friendly, study findThe results showed that alligators create neural maps very similar to those previously observed in barn owls and chickens. The same maps have not been recorded in the equivalent structure in mammal brains.“We know so little about dinosaurs,” Professor Carr said. “Comparative studies such as this one, which identify common traits extending back through evolutionary time add to our understanding of their biology.”The study is published in the Journal of Neuroscience.We’ll tell you what’s true.

The odds remain small but not insignificant – around one-tenth of 1 per cent.Only slightly wider than the height of the Empire State Building, Bennu is not big enough to destroy Earth but could cause huge destruction.Its size makes it the smallest body to ever be orbited by a spacecraft, Nasa said.Studying Bennu with Osiris-Rex will allow researchers to learn more about the origins of our solar system, the sources of water and organic molecules on Earth, and the hazards and resources in near-Earth space, the space agency said.Nasa\u0026nbspwill\u0026nbsphost\u0026nbspa media conference at 5.30pm GMT to announce further details about the agency\u0027s mission to return the spacecraft to Earth.We’ll tell you what’s true.

Not all companies are prepared for the worstWith a week to go, the prime minister has finally sought to delay Brexit. As things stand, however, there is no formal agreement between the government and the EU about the length of any Article 50 extension.So, what\u0026nbspwould\u0026nbspa Brexit delay do to inidual businesses in terms of\u0026nbspcontingency planning?Not much, is the answer.\u0026nbspOne thing to understand is that a lot of businesses simply haven’t done any.When the Institute of Directors (IoD) looked at this question earlier in the year it found 40 per cent of its members had taken no steps at all to prepare for a sudden no-deal situation.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThat may seem like extraordinary complacency, given the wretched state of a\u0026nbspUK government\u0026nbspled by arguably the worst prime minister in history. And in some cases, that’s probably true. (There is still the feeling that “it just won’t happen” in some quarters.)\u0026nbspBut there is a much larger slate of smaller firms that simply lack the resources to be able to plan effectively\u0026nbspfor the\u0026nbsplooming earthquake.\u0026nbspWatchdog bans advert encouraging loans to fund Brexit food stockpilesWe’re just over a week away from the notional exit date and it’s still the case that no one really\u0026nbsphas the faintest idea how (or when) this will end, and what the impact will be. That being the case, small firms have opted to take a wait and see approach. They will react to what emerges, because they don’t have much of a choice.\u0026nbspThe IoD, and the Scottish National Party, have called for businesses to be issued with prep vouchers, along the lines of\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspschemes the Irish and Dutch governments have put into operation.\u0026nbspThese, the IoD says, could persuade some to act in the event of a short delay by incentivising them to take preparatory measures.\u0026nbspWhatever is agreed, those businesses that are prepping will continue to do so. Those that aren’t will carry on crossing their fingersBut that looks unlikely at present. For a start, the EU doesn’t seem minded to agree to a short extension\u0026nbspand such a scheme would be an example of something the current government seems allergic to: forward-thinking policy-making.Suren Thiru, from the British Chambers of Commerce, says those that have been preparing for no deal will continue to do so if a delay is secured. That means a continuation of the weak investment that is slowing the UK economy to a crawl as resources are erted to emergency planning.\u0026nbspThe problem for all businesses, as he points out, is that there are just “so many key questions to which we don’t have answers”. How will trade work, how will customs work, how will\u0026nbspfirms lay their hands on the staff they need?The prospect of a “rolling”, non-date-specific delay fills businesses with almost as much horror as no deal (which\u0026nbspmost regard as the equivalent of Hereditary, The Exorcist\u0026nbspand Children of the Corn all merged into one).\u0026nbspSo whatever is agreed, those businesses that are prepping will keep doing so. Those that aren’t will carry on crossing their fingers in the hope of Westminster coming to its senses.\u0026nbspThey’d probably best cross their toes, and anything else they can lay their hands on while they’re at it.\u0026nbspGot an unanswered question about Brexit?

And, he said, he was advising all the contenders for the Democrat nomination for next year’s\u0026nbspelection of the need to put an\u0026nbspEU deal first if they win.The senator said that while he was not echoing President Barack Obama’s warning that Britain would be in the “back of the queue” for an agreement, he stressed that Congress “would think very carefully” about giving London precedence over the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit so far: in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Boris Johnson led the VoteLeave campaignBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

Speaking in Brussels alongside Irish taoiseach Leo Varadkar, Mr Tusk said: “I’ve been wondering what a special place in hell looks like for people who promoted Brexit without even a sketch of a plan how to carry it out safely.” He also tweeted the accusation moments later4343 EU and UK announce talks to restart after Theresa May visits BrusselsBoth have agreed to restart Brexit talks to find “a way through” the deadlock in Westminster, following a visit by Theresa May to Brussels. In a joint statement the British government and European Commission said Ms May had had a “robust but constructive” meeting with president Jean-Claude Juncker, and that the pair would meet again before the end of the month. But the EU again refused to reopen the withdrawal agreement and its controversial backstop – with any negotiations expected to focus on the future relationship between the UK and EU insteadIn the meantime Britain is likely to have to wait “two or three years” for talks while “the economy starts to suffer in a major way here because of a semi-hard Brexit.“I think we have got to put the EU first and Britain second, not because we don’t love Britain, but because we have got to do some important work to restore American relations with multilateral institutions like Europe,” said the Connecticut senator.Mr Murphy was speaking in London as the US president’s son, Donald Trump Jr, declared in an op-ed in The  that democracy was “all but dead” in UK because Theresa May had failed to deliver Brexit.Donald Trump Jr’s remarks about Brexit are astonishingly hypocriticalMr Trump\u0026nbspJr criticised the British prime minister because she had “ignored advice from my father”. Mr Trump had stated that he had repeatedly advised Ms May to go for a hard Brexit.Mr Trump Jr, who holds no political office, has been in the news for being part of special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into Russian collusion which allegedly helped put the president in the White House.Mr Murphy, seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, is on a trip to the UK, Northern Ireland and Ireland, during which he is meeting ministers and politicians about “an alternative view” from Washington to the Trump administration about Brexit.He is meeting David Liddington, the minister for the Cabinet Office who has been described as Ms May’s “de-facto deputy prime minister”,\u0026nbspand MPs in London politicians including DUP leaders in Belfast and Ireland’s\u0026nbspforeign minister\u0026nbspSimon Coveney in Dublin.The senator described Donald Jr’s view as “bonkers” and wondered why any credence should be given to someone who is not a member of the administration and holds no elected office.“I am not sure what the views of the president’s children have to do with this,”\u0026nbspsaid Mr Murphy.Turning to Mr Trump, the senator continued there is a “worry that the president’s message is drowning out other perspectives coming from the United States”.Speaking of the president’s call for a hard Brexit, he said: “Trump has worked himself into a box where he is demanding a hard Brexit which would shatter the peace process, which would then quell any interest in congress to support a trade agreement with Britain. There’s a circular firing squad here that the president has created.“The Irish American lobby, of which I am a member, is pretty powerful in the US. Unless there is certainty about how you’re going to put off a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, there isn’t going to be a lot of interest in congress in the US getting into a trade deal with Britain.Mr Murphy advised caution over Mr Trump’s tweets promising a quick trade agreement with Britain: “We’ve learnt not to pay too much attention to the president’s Twitter feed. There is not a lot of connection between what he tweets and what he does.“So just because the president’s tweeting that he’s going to go gangbusters into a US-Britain trade deal doesn’t mean that he’s going to, nor does it mean congress will follow.”The senator also warned that London should not expect an easy ride in a Trump deal. The US will have great leverage in negotiations and use it to demand market access for farm products like chlorinated chicken now barred from Europe, he warned.“Trump wants to negotiate with Britain because he can get stuff from Britain that he can’t get from the EU. The administration believes it can get Britain to drop agricultural protections that it can’t get Brussels to drop,” he said.The senator said there was “big bipartisan support for a trade relationship with Britain” but also “big support for a relationship with the European Union ... We worry about the European Union if the US incentivises countries to leave and a trade agreement between the US and Britain comes before a trade agreement between the US and the European Union.”MPs pass Theresa May’s deal in House of CommonsDamage to the European Union would be “a gift” to Russia, held Mr Murphy. “It will be another quiver to their arrow, help them in weakening the EU. Russia is surreptitiously trying to get countries to leave the EU and if their message is that a bilateral free trade agreement with the US awaits upon departure from the EU, then it makes their case more persuasive.“That’s why I think congress is going to think very carefully about how to sequence these trade agreements, as a way to send a message to Russia that we stand with the EU,” he commented.Asked about whether he supported a second referendum, Mr Murphy said he did not want to comment directly on an issue before parliament.But, he continued: “It feels to me like a lot of people here want a second look at this with all this new information. If there’s talk of a second referendum, I want to make sure that folks have all the information in front of them.Mr Murphy pointed out that the US was also facing political upheaval with a prolonged standoff between the president and congress.He added: “Our crisis is a 30-day government shutdown and your crisis is total and utter confusion about how to leave the EU.”\u0026nbspAnd while Mr Trump may be a one-term president:\u0026nbsp“Brexit is forever, in that way it’s very different what’s happening there and what’s happening here.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

It’s not the role of the Home Office to play theologian.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “This letter is not in accordance with our policy approach to claims based on religious persecution, including conversions to a particular faith.“We continue to work closely with key partners, including the All-Party Parliamentary Group on International Freedom of religion and a range of faith groups, to improve our policy guidance and training provided to asylum decision-makers so that we approach claims involving religious conversion in the appropriate way.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

At no stage did she pause to consider whether it is, in fact, the way she is leading this government that might be contributing to the situation.”The pro-EU Tory said he had long considered Ms May to be “a friend”, but added: “I have to say I could have wept – wept to see her reduced to these straits.May hints she will quit if forced to accept long delay to Brexit“And wept to see the extent to which she was now simply zig-zagging all over the place, instead of standing up for what the national interest must be.”Created with Sketch.

Total constitutional constipation. Ironically Brexit also sounds like a constipation relief medicine.Unless the prime minister changed course “at the 11th hour and 59th minute”, the UK would “spiral down into oblivion, and the worst part of it all is that we will deserve it”, Mr Grieve added.The fierce criticism came after Ms May used prime minister’s questions to lay into MPs for twice rejecting her deal – and for threatening to do so a third time.Explaining why she was not seeking a long Brexit delay, she told the Commons: “The outcome of a long extension would be endless hours and days of this house carrying on contemplating its navel on Europe and failing to address the issues that matter to our constituents.“This house has indulged itself on Europe for too long. It’s time for this house to determine that it will deliver on Brexit for the British people.What would Brexit delay mean for UK business contingency planning?Brexit extension ‘conditional on MPs voting for deal’ says EU’s TuskTheresa May’s letter to Donald Tusk: what she said and what she meantStudent leaders sign letter urging May to hold Final Say referendum “That’s what the British people deserve. They deserve better than what this house has given them so far.”The comments came during a stormy prime minister’s questions, during which MPs lined up to attack Ms May’s plan to ask the EU for only a short extension to the Article 50 process.She was bombarded with criticism that a short delay – even if granted – would achieve nothing, given the logjam at Westminster.It was pointed out that the decision flew in the face of the motion, passed by MPs last week, for a long delay if – as has happened – the government was still unable to pass its agreement.The deal now looks even more doomed, because Brexiteer MPs are even less likely to abandon their opposition with the threat of a long extension evaporating.Furthermore, speaker John Bercow has warned he will not even allow a third meaningful vote\u0026nbspunless the proposal before MPs has “significantly changed”, which the EU has ruled out.We’ll tell you what’s true.

back\u0026nbspher Brexit deal by staging repeat votes are in tatters, after speaker\u0026nbspJohn Bercow dramatically blocked the tactic, citing rules dating back to before the Gunpowder Plot.The prime minister was left stunned by the shock announcement – which torpedoed her hopes of a third “meaningful vote” while threatening MPs with a long delay to leaving the EU if they refused to give way.The dramatic twist, outlawing fresh votes without substantial changes, left ministers scrabbling for solutions – including an extraordinary proposal to suspend parliament and start a new session.It also achieved the remarkable feat of uniting supporters of a no-deal Brexit and a second referendum, who both believed it made their favoured option more likely.The solicitor general, who warned of “a constitutional crisis”, put forward the escape route of ending the current parliamentary session early to get around the 1604 convention invoked by the speaker, which lapses after a fresh Queen’s Speech.Here’s how Theresa May can get around Bercow’s dramatic Brexit ruling“There are ways around this – a prorogation of parliament and a new session,” said Robert Buckland.Created with

12-day session to pass legislation to reduce the power\u0026nbspof the House of Lords.No 10 is also mulling a possible vote to overturn the speaker’s ruling – but this seemed only likely to succeed if there are enough supporters of the deal in the first place.There was no immediate official response from Downing Street, other than to express its fury that Mr Bercow gave no warning of his bombshell announcement, made in the Commons chamber.The speaker said a further meaningful vote\u0026nbspwould be ruled out of order if the motion was “the same or substantially the same” – under a 1604 convention to stop the government bullying parliament on issues MPs have rejected.Ms May has already admitted that the negotiations with the EU are over, making it hard for her to argue that a further meaningful vote will be on a different question.Crucially, the speaker suggested something would have to be renegotiated with the EU to constitute a “change”, rather than, for example, a clarification of legal advice by the attorney general.Is Matteo Salvini going to veto a Brexit extension?French EU minister names cat ‘Brexit’ because of its indecisive natureMr Bercow told MPs: “What the government cannot legitimately do is resubmit to the house the same proposition – or substantially the same proposition – as that of last week, which was rejected by 149 votes.”The Independent revealed in January that pro-EU MPs believed that Ms May’s tactic to bludgeon her deal through, despite heavy defeats, was barred by parliamentary rules.Senior Tories were livid, believing the speaker had once again laid bare his anti-Brexit bias while twisting constitutional rules to suit his purpose.Rory Stewart, the prisons minister, taunted Mr Bercow by tweeting: “‘When I use a word,’\u0026nbspHumpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean.’”He added: “In the normal course of events, as the speaker says, parliament says no, and the issue is dropped.“But in this case, this is not an option, because these votes respond to an instruction in a referendum, endorsed by parliament, which rules out dropping back to the status quo.”Supporters of a Final Say referendum were delighted, with former Tory MP Anna Soubry telling\u0026nbspThe Independent: “It puts a second referendum very firmly at the top of the agenda –\u0026nbspit must do. We need a way out of this and this is the only way out.”Guto Bebb, a former Tory minister and People’s Vote supporter, said: “It is inconceivable now for ministers to carry on trying to force this broken Brexit deal on the people of the United Kingdom.”And David Lammy, a Labour supporter of the anti-Brexit Best for Britain group, said: “If the prime minister wants us to vote on her deal again, she should add an amendment allowing for her deal to be put to the people.”In the short term, the speaker’s intervention killed off any prospect of a third meaningful vote this week – already in doubt as the Democratic Unionist Party failed to switch sides.It appears certain that Ms May will have to ask EU leaders for a long\u0026nbspextension – anything between nine\u0026nbspand 21 months – to the Article 50 process at a summit in Brussels on Thursday.The new departure date will then be put to a “take-it-or-leave-it vote” in the Commons and Lords next week, just days before the 29 March Brexit day.For that reason, it increases the chances of a crash-out Brexit, which the Treasury has predicted could\u0026nbsptrigger a near 10 per cent GDP decline.However, a long extension could also open up the space for a further referendum, which some believe the prime minister might yet embrace if it is the only hope of passing her agreement.Speaking to a silent Commons, Mr Bercow said repeat votes had been blocked on 12 occasions up until 1920 – a situation only not repeated since because of “general compliance”.“This convention is very strong and longstanding, dating back to 2 April 1604,” the speaker said.“It’s a necessary rule to ensure the sensible use of house time and the proper respect for the decision which it takes.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Her speech was incendiary and irresponsible. If any harm comes to any of us, she will have to accept her share of responsibility.”His Labour colleague Lisa Nandy accused Ms May of “pitting parliament against the people”, saying that to do so was “dangerous and reckless”. She added: “Yesterday her government attacked their civil servants. Now she’s attacking the MPs whose votes she needs. It will have cost her support.”Sam Gyimah, the Conservative former minister, said that engaging in a “blame game” was “a low blow”.“Democracy loses when a PM who has set herself against the HoC then blames MPs for doing their job. Distracts from Art 50 extension, all part of her strategy to run down the clock and rule out other options. Toxic,” he added.Fellow Tory Connor Burns asked of the address: “What was actually the point of that?”Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats’ Jo\u0026nbspSwinson\u0026nbsptweeted: “PM says\u0026nbspMPs\u0026nbsphaven’t said what they want??? @LibDems\u0026nbspand many others have been crystal clear WE WANT A PEOPLE’S VOTE AND WE WANT IT NOW!”And Anna Soubry, who left the Conservatives for The Independent Group, tweeted: “Fed up with Brexit?

I agree. I am on your side. It is now time for MPs to decide.”Parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice. Motion after motion and amendment after amendment has been tabled without parliament ever deciding what it wantsShe then doubled down on an attack she had fired directly at MPs earlier in the day, saying: “So far, parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice.“Motion after motion and amendment after amendment has been tabled without parliament ever deciding what it wants.“All MPs have been willing to say is what they do not want. I passionately hope MPs will find a way to back the deal I’ve negotiated with the EU, a deal that delivers on the result of the referendum and is the very best deal negotiable.”Earlier in the day, Mr Tusk said a short extension would be possible, but would be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement.Mr Tusk said that if the deal is not approved by MPs then the EU may hold another emergency summit to decide what to do.A leaked diplomatic note which emerged earlier showed any extension would be a “binary” choice between a short extension to 23 May, close to Ms May’s suggested leave date, or a long extension until at least the end of the year that would see the UK participate in European parliament elections – something the prime minister said would be unacceptable.Yet in the Commons earlier in the day, Ms May said: “As prime minister, I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than 30 June.”She later repeated the statement to drive home the message, leading to intense speculation she would quit if forced into a position where the only way to avoid a no deal was a long delay to Brexit.Later, Ms May’s spokesman repeatedly failed to give a clear answer over whether her words definitely meant she would resign rather than seek a long extension, finally saying: “What you should infer is her determination to get this over the line.”MPsIn a major obstacle to her strategy Commons speaker\u0026nbspJohn Bercow\u0026nbsphas warned he will not even allow a third “meaningful vote”\u0026nbspunless the proposal before MPs has “significantly changed”.The prime minister spent the evening before her statement meeting MPs in a bid to persuade them to get behind her deal, if Mr Bercow allows the crucial vote to go ahead next week.Many Conservatives were pushing her to simply let the UK drop out of the EU without a deal on 29 March if her plans fail to gain approval.Nigel Evans MP said: “A lot of us believe we should just leave a week Friday anyway.”We’ll tell you what’s true.

Starting over is just not an option — andNo Deal is unpalatable toMPs, then the obvious solution is to support leaving with a deal.Secondly, a y delay puts us in the awkward position of having to stand candidates for the European Parliament election.This would be a humiliation and the public would be right to be furious.Worse still, as part of an offer for a long extension, the EU may require us to hold a second referendum.Thirdly, we came dangerously close to a backbencher coup — where those who did not win the right to govern wish to take over the role of government, in an extra-ordinarily unconstitutional move that would overturn years of parliamentary conventions with the sole aim of stopping Brexit.Make no mistake, their motives were not to deliver a dferent Brexit or to honour the result of the referendum — it would be to stop Brexit in its tracks. All the while, our hard-working voters and our long-suffering businesses just want to get on with le beyond Brexit.In a survey by market researchers Survation, the majority of Conservative voters said they would take Theresa May’s deal over every other option — No Deal, a long delay or another referendum.There is, however, an obvious solution to all this — and every parliamentarian can choose to take it.I spend my days at the legislative coalface as Leader of the House of Commons. I know what we need to get done to leave the EU in a smooth fashion — and I also know that we do not need is a y extension.While the negotiators have been hard at it in Brussels, I’ve been preparing for and delivering the legislative changes needed for Brexit to make sure our laws work when we leave.So I know thatwe get this deal passed next week, we can deliver Brexit quickly — and potentially much faster than the end of June.If both Houses — the Lords and the Commons — acknowledge the country’s desire to get this settled, we can crack on with passing the Withdrawal Agreement Bill.A short extension to get the legislation finalised is far better than a long one — which would come with unacceptable conditions we have no control over.In setting out the parliamentary timetable, I will, as I always do, fully respect Parliament’s desire to scrutinise and debate.But I will also be looking to move quickly, so Parliament can turn its attention to the wealth of opportunity that awaits us when we leave the EU.As I said at the dispatch box this week, this is an important time for Parliament and there have been dficult decisions to make.With such strongly held views across the House, it’s vital that we continue to listen to each other with respect and understanding.Over the centuries, the country has looked on as Parliament has faced historic decisions.Even in the most challenging of times, we have pulled together and put our duty above all .So I hope the House will now find a consensus that delivers on the will of the people to leave the EU as close to March  as possible.We can then, finally, turn our eyes to the bright future ahead of us and seek to reinstate confidence in British politics.Let’s do our duty — and do our country proud.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We all stand united as brothers and sisters”.Her defiant words are a fitting epitaph for the New Zealand victims: “We must tell them you will not win.”ENOUGH is enough on the Brexit shambles. We want out as soon as possible.A poll today shows that  per cent want PM Theresa May to ignore MPs and leave the EU without a deal.Buther exit plan does not get past Parliament, Britain’s departure could be postponed for two years.

It would be an Establishment stitch-up, with serious consequences for the public’s faith in democracy for decades to come.For those Labour supporters who voted to leave, it’s a reminder that the party’s MPs are desperate to overturn the result of the ‘People’s Vote’ in June .There are some notable exceptions. But the vast majority are determined to frustrate Brexit, regardless of the result of our biggest ever democratic exercise.Labour is now far more interested in north London than the north of England.The threat of Remainers wrecking our departure gets more pressing by the day.Brexiteers must accept reality and back the best Brexit possible: the PM’s deal.MIKE Thalassitis’ suicide is a wake-up call for Britain’s TV companies — and the country at large.Suicide is the single biggest killer of men under  in the UK.

Run for your lives.“But it really isn’t like that.”Oh, OK, you could maybe take your chances listening to her Fanny impression then. Talking of which, This Morning’s Martin Lewis. There’s a strong argument to say he should have been made to do If I Were A Rich Man, from Fiddler On The Roof. And an equally strong one to say he really shouldn’t. But he ended up doing Any Dream Will Do, from Joseph, and oh-my-s**tting dachshund he was bad. Talking point of the night, evenCorrie’s Daniel Brocklebank won, was Alan Titch-marsh singing Some Enchanted Evening, from South Pacic, on a stretch of thoughtfully placed decking.A man overcome with emotion. The main one being anger by the look on his face.Like next door’s kids had just punted their football straight into his prize begonias, it was.The audience went nuts for it, though, the judges were in floods of overwhelmed tears and, must admit, even I was aware I was watching something that would be played again and again, for both good and bad reasons.But I must urge caution here. Antony Cotton got his own ITV chat show after winning Soapstar Superstar.It just needed Simon Cowell tuning in on Sunday, and, before you know it, he’s got Titchmarsh back in the white blazer trying to Dream The Impossible Dream for the Christmas No.Still, we have to look for the positives, and what I’ll ultimately take from All Star Musicals is the fact John Barrowman appeared on telly, for two entire hours, and didn’t shout: “FAB-U-LOUS!” once.Progress. FRIDAY.

Or am I just odd ”No, you’re corpulent as well.ROMESH Ranganathan broke with  years of Red Nose Day tradition and said something vaguely funny about Four Weddings And A Funeral on Friday night.“As a young Asian kid growing up in Crawley that film really spoke to me.”OK, not belly  laughs, but an acknowledgement that some of us don’t get Four Weddings and think we need a charity sequel about as much as Gregg Wallace needs a hairnet on Inside The Factory.Still, it was a chance to see what the ravages of time have done to almost everyone except Andie MacDowell, who certainly hasn’t spent the past  years taking acting lessons.The lesbian wedding plot was also entirely in keeping with the right-on tone of an event that’s so self-satisfied, starstruck and preachy you can understand why some people think Africa should go it alone rather than submit to Comic Relief’s condescension for all eternity.You’ll have to make your own judgment call on the true value of Red Nose Day, where the night’s grand total has been dropping ever since  and civilians have been almost vanished from the process entirely.Personally, I took inspiration from Sir Lenny Henry’s final words of the night: “See you in two years’ time maybe.”’Cos I heard that “maybe” and thought, “maybe not”. Channel ’s  Hours In Police ­Custody.The “fat ginger” ­playground line on Ricky ­Gervais’ new Netflix ­comedy After Le.Goggleboxer Lee dipping his Doritos in Jenny’s face pack.Scotland’s Finn Russell suddenly deciding he’d given England enough of a head start at - in an enthralling Calcutta Cup match.And Celebs Go Dating civilian Joe asking Love Island’s Georgia Steel, “What do you actually do ” and getting the perfect response  from narrator Rob Beckett: “In summary, f*** all.”b “Down Royal and Downpatrick in Northern Ireland host the racing of what animals ”Matt: “Cows.”Bradley Walsh: “What flying animal is the slang term for doing time in prison ”Rachel: “Monkey.”Bradley Walsh: “The hymn Guide Me, O Thou Great Jehovah is most associated with which sport ”Shirley: “Fishing.”Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “Colloquially known as ‘Dubya’, President George Bush used which middle initial to distinguish himself from his father ”Jacob: “J.” .CHANNEL ’s hugely entertaining series The Bachelor UK was further proof that men are  from Mars and women are from an as-yet- undiscovered galaxy many thousands of light years away.They seemed surprisingly keen to mate with Alex Marks, though, considering he looked like Captain Haddock with a man-bun, below, and would’ve been the most vacant lot on any planetit wasn’t for the presence of host Mark Wright.He had only one tactic with all of the women as well: Tell them “You’re beautul,” ask for “a hug,” then move in for the kill with Reanne, Robyn, Charlotte T, Charlotte E, mad Georgie the circus performer, and even shark-eyed Essex nightmare Alicia.It was working a treat as well, until Tuesday’s episode, when Alicia found Alex snogging Charlotte T and it all kicked off massively.Reanne took the smartest option available, in the circumstances, by immediately quitting  the show.Alicia  took the dumbest option available, by locking herself in the South African mansion’s bathroom.So she can probably be thankful it wasn’t a celebrity version of the show and Alex is hardly the sharpest tool in  the box.Because the gormless, great oaf  only went and ruined everything by picking Alicia ahead of talented, beautul and much nicer Charlotte T on Thursday night’s final.I’d give it until the end of the credits.INCIDENTALLY,you’re still trying to decide whether Baptiste is great TV or not, it’s not.Andyou don’t believe me, watch next Sunday’s far-fetched finale and try to avoid replying: “Not bloody soon enough” when Stratton screams: “God, when does it end ”Bet you can’t. SORRY.

Then MPs backed a Brexit delay.It’s asthe House of Commons is ­following Tony Blair’s step-by-step guide to overturning the  referendum.A No Deal Brexit will only happen in nine days’ timethe EU refuses an ­extension. That is unlikely.Theresa May will beg for a delay, whatever the conditions.EU members will not want to be blamed for a messy No Deal outcome.From next week, MPs could start voting on their preferred Brexit options through so-called indicative votes. Spoiler alert — they will not end up backing a harder exit.I know there are Leave voters who do not like Theresa May’s Brexit deal.Butyou do not like her deal, look at the alternative options for softer Brexits, which would be far worse for the country.If you think this deal risks the UK ­getting stuck in a customs union, just wait till you see what the deal would look like with Labour’s “permanent” customs union glued on top.Better to have an imperfect route to controlling our own trade policy than no route at all.If you do not like the fact that, under the PM’s deal, we would have to keep existing EU goods and agricultural rules, imagine staying in the Single Market or, as it is rebranded, Common Market .. We would lose the veto over goods rules which we have in the backstop, and be forced to follow rules on services too.Even in a worst-case scenario, Theresa May’s deal lets us escape the EU’s “ever closer union” political project and seize control of our own immigration policy.We would be in control of almost all our economy and not have to pay a penny for it on an ongoing basis.It is far better than most critics will admit. Thanks to changes secured at Strasbourg last week, we have new protections.The EU can no longer do what French President Macron arrogantly threatened. It will not be able to use the backstop as a “trap” to demand access to UK fishing waters.The EU cannot just say “non” to every sensible idea for resolving the Irish border issues. The so-called Star Chamber of MPs were quick to reject the Strasbourg changes.But they should listen to the Irish opposition party.Their Brexit spokesperson said: “We have come a long way” from a “bullet-proof, rock-solid, cast-iron backstop”.Or how about top barrister Lord ­Pannick  He is the QC who won the case for Gina Miller against the Government.He argues that in some circumstances the UK could terminate the deal through the so-called Vienna Convention.Conservative Eurosceptic big beasts, from ex-leader Michael Howard to former Chancellor Norman Lamont, have all weighed in behind the deal.David Davis, who resigned over ­Chequers, is now onside.Lord Trimble, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for the Good Friday Agreement, has backed it. If he can live with the backstop, that should count for something.But some Eurosceptic back- benchers still refuse to support the PM’s deal.Led by Jacob Rees-Mogg, they would prefer a harder deal. But face facts. There is no harder Brexit on offer.With No Deal out of reach, there is no incentive for the EU to provide any more concessions.That means the choices are this deal or a softer Brexit. Or no Brexit at all.And be sure that the Speaker, John Bercow, will bend every possible rule to frustrate Brexit.So, do not expect a long delay to offer a better answer.Anyway, the choice on our future could be made soon.There is no time to lose to save Brexit. Even a snap General Election offers no easy salvation. It would mean Theresa May leading the Tories into another campaign on a manesto of her deal — precisely what her critics want to avoid. And of course, the Conservatives could lose any path to power at all, kissing goodbye to any Brexit.Brexit would never have happenedit had not been for Boris Johnson.Now he has a crucial opportunity to save the whole project.He can show how he can be a ­statesman, by compromising in the national interest.And he can demonstrate the sort of leadership that won him so much praise as Mayor of London.If the Government can persuade the DUP to vote for the deal, backbenchers including Dominic Raab, Iain Duncan Smith, Theresa Villiers and Mark Harper should follow suit.Otherwise, they risk being remembered as the MPs who wrecked Brexit, along with Labour MPs who helped trigger ­Article  and then opposed both No Deal and the current deal.Theresa May also needs to recognise that backbenchers want someone  to take forward the next stage of the negotiations.If she tries to cling to power, critics on both sides of the Brexit ide may never back her deal.Whereasshe pledges to step down on getting her deal through, she can step down as a hero who delivered Brexit against the odds.MPs should know that politics is about taking the world as you find it, not as you would like it to be.And leadership is about taking decisions, even when all the choices are unpalatable.It is fine to stick to principle, but notthat means emulating King Canute’s stand against the waves.If Brexit does not happen it will be a ­national democratic calamity.As the party in power, the Conservatives will be punished.That means risking ­letting Jeremy Corbyn — a leader who can not even deal with anti-Semitism in his own party — seize control of the country.The stakes simply could not be higher. If this chance is squandered we will likely never get another moment.Right across Europe, critics of Brussels will think “even Britain couldn’t break free”.Henry Newman is director of the Open Europe think tank.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We needed the permission of the police to do that but you know, but quite frankly I didn’t care and neither did M. We just wanted to get on with it.Mr Peribanez adds: Patrick was a young kid at the time. We spent hours doing stake outs, surveillance. He was a quick learner.Mr Malinka confirmed he was followed, telling the documentary: My first experience of private surveillance was when I saw some cars in my rear view mirrors. I made a list of the number plates.Patrick says: We were trying to find out where he was going because it looked like he was trying to get somewhere in a rush.He has no regret for his actions, saying: I didn’t feel sorry for anybody. The little girl who had been abducted - that is the person I felt sorry for. Nobody .Mr Peribanez said at one point his boss told me to call him and offer him money to talk about the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.Confirming the approach was made, Mr Malinka reveals: In this sort of situation there are two types of people - one with power and one without. I didn’t have the power or the money.Mr Peribanez continues: I started with ,and I went to half a million, something like that. Malinka said don’t offer me money because I don’t know anything and I can’t give you anything.While Mr Malinka was wrongly dragged into the botched police inquiry someone firebombed his car when it was parked by his flat in Luz, and the Portuguese word FALA, which means talk, was sprayed on the pavement.There is no suggestion in the documentary M had anything to do with that crime but Mr Malinka recalls the incident, saying: This is the only time when it broke me, really hurt me. One missed phone call pretty much ruined ten years of my le.Mr Peribanez also admits: We put some trackers on Murat’s car and they found them.

Theresa May is still Prime Minister and we’re currently heading for a Brexit which would be a travesty of the one we voted for in . If we get Brexit at all.Some of the Brexiteers in Parliament think we might still be able to escape the EU with a No Deal, on World Trade Organisation terms. I think they are deluding themselves.Parliament, which is two to one in favour of NOT leaving the EU, simply will not let it happen.And the EU, desperate to retain its market for goods in the UK, will make sure it doesn’t happen, too.Our Brexiteers are right that Theresa May’s deal is awful. Butthey get a chance to vote on it again, they should hold their noses and vote in favour.Because I reckon it’s that or nothing. We will have a delay, the EU may insist we hold a second referendum as a condition of that delay.And trust me, the second referendum will be rigged in favour of remaining in the EU. It will not be a straightforward in or out option. There will be three options, to split the Leave vote down the middle.In this fight to leave the EU, the British people have had everything against them. The EU, obvs. But also the House of Commons and the puffed-up, ludicrous, pro-Remain speaker John Bercow. And the House of Lords, the civil service and the BBC.The lesson for us low-born, powerless Leavers is to take what we can and scarper before the whole idea is killed stone dead. Which I fear it may be.And now Mrs May is heading back to Brussels to plead for a delay in triggering Article .All along she has been too obsessed with the process of leaving the EU, rather than the clear imperative as demanded by the British people — to simply LEAVE the EU, all of it.She has followed Brussels’ agenda at every twist and turn. And she’ll be following it now. She’ll do what the EU wants.So here’s the deal, as I see it. Give her hopeless proposal one more chance and this time vote for it.We will have been cheated, but not as badly aswe do not leave at all.Because the longer this goes on, the more likely that outcome will be.THIS country becomes more deranged by the very hour.A Roman Catholic journalist claims she may face JAIL because she referred to a transgendered person by the sex assigned at birth, rather than the one she now identies as.Caroline Farrow has been told she must attend a police station for a taped interview.She said: “I have pointed out to police that I am a Catholic journalist commentator and it is my religious belief that a person cannot change sex.”Quite.

Such as “zir” and “hir” and the horrible “peoplekind”.I hope they have room next year for these following words I’ve just made up: Togerov – a Bulgarian man who has transitioned to female.Abbottophobia – the irrational fear that Diane is about to appear on the TV talking complete b******s.Droll – an internet troll who is nonetheless quite funny.WYLFWTS– someone on a gender studies or media studies course.

I quickly came to learn that, in relation to Brexit, nothing could be further from the truth.Unfortunately, I must remain anonymous for fear of the backlash I would receive at my place of work.However, I can reveal I am a senior policy professional within the service and work closely with a number of government departments.There are a number of extremely dangerous myths regarding civil servants that I must dispel because of the impact they are having on the Brexit process.MYTH : The civil service is independent. The civil service was founded on the pillars of political neutrality.Civil servants are meant to ensure that their own political persuasions do not affect their work. Crucially, they should accept those from all political leanings and points of view.It has become clear to me that the vast majority of civil servants support Remain.From my observations I would estimate this number to be well over  per cent.This is worrying in itself and far from representative of the  per cent of the people who voted for Brexit.Most horrying, however, is the sheer disdain and utter contempt that my colleagues display towards people who voted to Leave.I have lost count of the number of insulting and derogatory terms that are used in my own department and where to refer to the .million people who voted for Brexit: “Racist”, “stupid”, “uneducated”.Anti-Brexit jokes and snide remarks are dropped casually into everyday office con-versations. I live in fear that my colleagues will discover through a slip of my tongue that I am a Brexiteer.Were this to happen, I believe that most would refuse to talk to me again and I might even lose my job.This entire culture creates a thickening cloud of negativity towards Brexit that shades all areas of the civil service. I have witnessed first-hand civil servants doing everything within their power, subtly and under the surface, to frustrate Brexit and talk it down at every opportunity.This can only seriously undermine our efforts to be in the strongest position possible on leaving the EU.MYTH : Civil servants are experts in their field.One would like to think the iniduals making decisions that affect our entire nation would have some level of skill or experience.If only that were true.For example, I know of one stand-alone “expert” policy team leading our preparations for Brexit.You can imagine my disbelief when I discovered none of its members had worked on anything remotely related to the EU before. In fact, I have discovered over time that the vast majority of “experts” within the service have no expertise whatsoever.In many cases the “portfolio” you take on when you join the service is dictated by the one held by your predecessor.As a result, you have new civil servants inheriting politically sensitive and highly important work without the faintest clue about what they are dealing with.Civil servants who are seriously underperforming will usually have a new job title and position created for them somewhere  in the organisation instead of being sacked or performance-managed — they become someone ’s problem then.Given the influence that civil servants are exerting over the Brexit process, this is truly concerning.MYTH : The civil service does not engage in scaremongering.I had hoped that civil servants, even in times of crisis, would be able to remain calm and level-headed in pursuit of ensuring the best outcomes for our country.And yet it is not uncommon for me to receive emails from colleagues promoting Brexit scare stories that are nothing more than lies and speculation. Recently, things have become so panicked that ious “Brexit contingency” plans have been set up throughout the organisation. This is to prepare for the “national public transport breakdown”, “surge in criminality” and “widespread public unrest” that is going to follow after we leave.These plans also involve collecting the personal details of certain civil servants to put in place a -hour, on-call rota for the “emergency” that is looming. This scare-mongering, created and whipped up by civil servants, is having a marked impact on the confidence and well-being of ordinary citizens.For example, one acquain-tance of mine is so terried by the speculative threats put out by the service they have started to stockpile large quantities of their medication. This needs to stop.MYTH : Ministers are in charge.When I was outside the civil service looking in, I always believed civil servants were there simply to advise their ministers, who, as elected representatives of the people, would make the ultimate decision. However, I have come to realise that ministers are often mere puppets, with civil servants pulling ferociously at their strings.The level of bureaucracy is unimaginable.In my experience parlia-mentary briefings go through — at a minimum — five stages of internal clearance, with crucial information being amended or deleted at every stage on the whim of that inidual civil servant.The power and competence of our ministers is, I’m afraid, a facade.They are nothing more than a megaphone for the views of biased civil servants who lurk behind them in the shadows.I am a supporter of the Leave campaign.To go against the will of the people expressed in the  referendum would be the ultimate act of betrayal.The Government MUST allow us to take back control by leaving the EU on World Trade Organisation terms. If the people are betrayed, I may have no choice but to resign.Honesty, impartiality, integrity and objectivity. We will soon discover, once and for all, whether our politicians embody these values.©The Sunday Times News Licensing Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I agree. It is now time for MPs to decide.”Her declaration came as EU chiefs laid down the gauntlet to MPs by insisting they will only grant Mrs May a short Brexit delay IF the Commons passes her deal next week.The ultimatum teed up the real chance of a clf edge No Deal Brexit on the originally scheduled March  exit in just eigtht days time.The PM ignited Westminster uproar yesterday by formally requesting a three month EU membership extension until June . But in a boost for the PM’s leverage on winning round diehard Brexiteers to back her deal, EU Council chief Donald Tusk also held up the prospect of a year-long delaythe agreement is voted down a third time next week.Addressing the nation live from No at .pm last night, Mrs May dubbed her three month delay “a matter of great personal regret for me”.But she added: “Of this I am absolutely sure: you the public have had enough. You are tired of the infighting. You are tired of the political games and arcane procedural rows.“Tired of MPs talking about nothing  but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children’s schools, our National Health Service, and kne crime.”Also on another day of extraordinary drama in Westminster yesterdayMrs May’s attack on rebel MPs triggered a backlash from many last night.Her former Universities Minister Sam Gyimah said: “Democracy loses when a PM sets herself against the House of Commons then blames MPs for doing their job.”Mr Tusk, president of the European Council, said in Brussels this evening: A short extension will be possible but it will be conditional on a positive vote on the withdrawal agreement in the House of Commons.His comments raise the prospect of a do-or-die Commons showdown next week, with MPs forced to choose between swallowing the PMs deal - even after rejecting it twice - or quitting without any deal on March .Conservative MP Bob Seely said: Sounds like Deal or No Deal next week.Mr Tusk did not mention the possibility of a long extension - but he has previously spoken in favour of delaying Brexit by up to two years, suggesting the EU could still swoop in at the last minute to put Article  on ice for months to come.Tory Brexiteers will seize the opportunity to go for a No Deal outcome by rejecting the PMs deal again next week.Mark Francois told Sky News: If the EU dont give us an extension and her deal is voted down again, then we are free - that is what I am fighting for.But dozens of Remainer MPs could flock to Mrs Mays side in a bid to avoid what they see as the worst-case scenario.Any extension must be signed off by every one of the other  EU leaders at the European Council summit starting tomorrow, giving a veto to each country.French media reported that Emmanuel Macron is so sick of the ongoing drama that he will block a delay at the upcoming European Council summit.Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the European Commission, suggested the request to delay could be rejected this week but then approved at an emergency EU summit next week.He told German radio: We will probably have to meet again next week, because Mrs May has not got agreement for anything either in her Cabinet or her Parliament. As long as we dont know what Great Britain will say yes to, we cant come to a resolution.The top Eurocrat added: If Great Britain does not leave at the end of March, then we are, I am sorry to say, in the hands of God. And I think even God sometimes reaches a limit to his patience.We are not in a state of war with the UK, but a state of negotiation. But the negotiations are finished.NO DEAL Brexit is now closer than ever.On the face of it, Donald Tusks statement means MPs will have to choose between approving Theresa Mays deal early next week, or crashing out with No Deal on March .Otherwise, Britain WONT get the three-month delay that the Commons voted for last week - which both the PM and Labour want to see.Brexiteers will use this as a chance to go for No Deal, which just a few days ago seemed almost impossible.But evenshe loses the support of Eurosceptic Tory backbenchers, the PM could still get her vote through by winning over Labour MPs.Even Jeremy Corbyn may drop his opposition to the deal rather than risk a No Deal outcome.However, some Remainers will cling on to the one option Mr Tusk failed to mention at all - a long extension lasting beyond the summer and potentially as long as two years.They still hope thatthe deal falls next week, Britain will end up staying in the EU permanently.But thats a high-stakes gamble - giving Parliament less than  hours to thrash out a months-long delay to Brexit which would then have to be signed off by  other EU leaders.It remains to be seen whether MPs are willing to risk it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Andrea Leadsom made the remarks on LBC Radio, where she appeared to suggest that children should not be required to learn anything about LGBT people until the age of . Itaposs led to comparisons with Section , the Tory law which banned promoting homosexuality in schools. But Ms Leadsom later claimed there had been unacceptable and deliberate misrepresentation of her views, which will have genuinely hurt my own LGBT friends and family. She told LBC: I think this party, my party has done a huge amount to support LGBT rights, and quite rightly to. Iaposm a massive supporter of the efforts that weaposve made to achieve real equality in LGBT rights. And so itaposs absolutely vital that children do grow up understanding the society that they live in and they grow up tolerant and seeking equality and respecting dferences.    Mrs Leadsom abstained on the vote for same-sex marriage to be legalised in . In , she said she really didnapost like the law because of the clear hurt it had caused to Christians. During the interview, she added: I think itaposs right that the government should have passed legislation that requires that relationships and sex education is taught in schools. But at the same time I also agree that itaposs right that parents should be able to choose the moment at which children become exposed to that information and there are steps taken to allow children to be withdrawn from classes up until a certain age. Ms Leadsom later said this comment was not specically about LGBT education, but about sex and relationships more generally. Asked at what age that should be, she said: Actually Iaposm sorry, Iaposm not quite sure, I think itaposs running up to their th birthday. But I would have to check. Ms Leadsom was slammed at Prime Ministeraposs Questions, and accused of using it as a dog-whistle.    Furious Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle said: I know the Prime Minister campaigned to keep Section , which banned LGBT people being talked about positively in schools and led to millions of young people like myself growing up in fear of being LGBT. I thought the Prime Minister had seen the error of her ways but this morning, the Leader of the House said on radio that parents should decide when theyaposre exposed to LGBT education. This is conservative party dog-whistle politics. He asked: Will the Prime Minister condemn the Leader of the House  Will she condemn bigots who donapost want LGBT people to be heard in schools and will she support Ofsted with good LGBT education in our schools   The Prime Minister replied: Iaposm very happy to write to him with the guidance that is given to schools on LGBT education and teaching. My right honourable friend, the minister for women and equalities and Secretary of State for International Development, has been at great pains to ensure working with the department for education that appropriate guidance is given to schools. I recognise the issue that the honourable gentleman has raised and I will write to him with the details of the guidance because it is very clear about what is appropriate. Later, Ms Leadsom said: As I said this morning, it is vital that every child is taught about the need for tolerance and respect, at home and in school, and that they demonstrate these values towards LGBT iniduals at all times.I believe wholeheartedly in equality and ensuring children grow up accepting and respecting the ersity that shapes our country. Government policy allows parents to choose when their child takes part in sex education lessons of all kind, up until the age of .This unacceptable and deliberate misrepresentation of my views will have genuinely hurt my own LGBT friends and family, as well as the wider LGBT community.

The Prime Minister lashed out at elected politicians for failing to rubber-stamp her pact, before packing her bag for tomorrowaposs crunch Brussels summit. She hit out hours after the EU issued the UK with a sensational Brexit ultimatum: accept her deal or crash out in just eight days. In a four-minute statement from Downing Street, Mrs May attacked the Westminster paralysis, claiming: “It is high time we made a decision. “So far Parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice. All MPs have been willing to say is what they do not want.” Addressing the country  minutes later than planned, she stepped into the wood-led State Dining Room at No at .pm and stood behind a lectern to insist the public wanted politicians to “get on with it”. Speaking in front of two Union Flags, she said it was a “matter of great personal regret” the UK would not leave the EU as planned on March .    The PM insisted: “Of this, I am absolutely sure - you the public have had enough. “You are tired of the infighting, you’re tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows, tired of MPs talking about nothing  but Brexit when you have real concerns about our children’s schools, our National Health Service, kne crime. “You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. “I agree, I am on your side. It is now time for MPs to decide.” And she again ruled out a second referendum to break the logjam. She said: We asked you already, and you gave us your answer. You want us to get on with it and that is what I intend to do. The PM’s statement was attacked from all sides.  Jeremy Corbyn spoke to the Prime Minister after the speech. After a phone call which lasted about  minutes, Mr Corbyn said: “The Prime Minister has shown tonight she is in complete denial about the scale of the crisis we are facing and unable to offer the leadership the country needs.“To continue to bring back her damaging and twice rejected deal without signicant changes, while threatening a no deal outcome ruled out by MPs, is unacceptable and reckless.“I made clear to the Prime Minister tonight that we must move immediately to agree a compromise alternative that supports jobs and living standards, can win the support of parliament, be negotiated with the EU and bring the country together.” Pro-EU Labour MP Stephen Doughty tweeted: “We are tired of *you* Prime Minister. You are not on our side. It’s the same old robotic nonsense. Time to listen. Time to compromise.”Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said: “The Prime Minister says the public is tired of Brexit. “If she wants to end the soap opera she has one clear way to do so: concede a People’s Vote.” “A short extension on the pretence her deal is acceptable to Parliament will achieve nothing.”  Brexiteer Tory Andrea Jenkyns tweeted: “As usual another statement saying very little. “PM says she regrets having to delay. Then don’t do it! “It is in the Prime Minister’s power to ensure we leave on the th, regardless of what Parliament suggests.” Fellow Conservative Connor Burns said in response to the speech: “What was actually the point of that ” Labour’s Lucy Powell, who is pushing for a soft Brexit, condemned Mrs May’s claim MPs have failed to decid what they want. Ms Powell said MPs have “never been asked what we want”, adding: “We just keep getting asked about the same thing that we’ve said we don’t want!” On another dramatic day at Westminster, Mrs May signalled should could quitshe was forced to take delay beyond June .  The high-stakes move came as she flies to the city for a crunch showdown with EU leaders tomorrow. She is set to gamble on winning her “meaningful vote” at a third attempt next week in a high-stakes Commons confrontation.The move piled pressure on Labour MPs in Leave-supporting areas to support her pact or stand accused of fuelling a doomsday no-deal departure.Senior backbencher Yvette Cooper accused the PM of simply carrying on with the same plan “that she has put to this House twice and has been roundly defeated”.   Mr Tusk said a short Brexit delay was “possible” - but onlyMPs backed the PM”s pact.Pressure was building on Labour MPs in the party’s Leave-supporting heartlands who feel duty-bound to honour the  referendum result. They offered No an olive branch, suggesting they would back her dealthe Government handed MPs power over the second stage of Brexit talks, negotiating the future relationship. The PM would also have to update Parliament every three months on the progress of negotiations on a trade deal. And the Commons would have a veto over the final terms of a pact governing the future relationship.    The amendment was tabled by Wigan MP Lisa Nandy and Stoke MP Gareth Snell, who both represent Leave areas. Earlier, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the PM’s attempt to “bribe” Labour MPs with a £.billion fund for “left behind” towns had backfired. The money was targeted at Leave-voting Labour constituencies to give communities a boost after leaving the EU. Blasting the PM’s “counterproductive” plot, Mr McDonnell said: “The Government’s bribe never attracted the votes that they wanted. “In fact, people like Lisa Nandy, who were key in those negotiations, came out and derided it as trivial and basically made it clear that to try that sort of manoeuvre at this stage of the negotiations was counterproductive to say the least. “It angered people and didn’t gain any support whatsoever.”    Downing Street is expected to need up to two dozen Labour MPs to back the withdrawal plan and cancel out the votes of hardline Tory Brexiteers. One MP said: “Why would I back the deal, putting my neck on the line with my own members,the Government can’t even get it’s act together with its own side ” A shadow minister from a Leave-supporting area said it was “not looking good” for the PM “at present”, with “very few” Labour MPs expected to back her. Theresa Mayaposs Downing Street statement in full Nearly three years have passed since the public voted to leave the European Union. It was the biggest democratic exercise in our countryaposs history. I came to office on a promise to deliver on that verdict. In March  I triggered the Article  process for the UK to exit the EU and Parliament supported it overwhelmingly. Two years on, MPs have been unable to agree on a way to implement the UKaposs withdrawal. As a result, we will now not leave on time with a deal on the th of March. This delay is a matter of great personal regret for me.  And of this I am absolutely sure: You, the public, have had enough. Youaposre tired of the infighting, youaposre tired of the political games and the arcane procedural rows, tired of MPs talking about nothing  but Brexit when you have real concerns about our childrenaposs schools, our National Health Service, kne crime. You want this stage of the Brexit process to be over and done with. I agree. I am on your side. It is now time for MPs to decide. So, today, I have written to Donald Tusk the President of the European Council to request a short extension of Article  up to the th of June to give MPs the time to make a final choice. Do they want to leave the EU with a deal which delivers on the result of the referendum, that takes control of our money borders and laws while protecting jobs and our national security  Do they want to leave without a deal, or do they not want to leave at all causing potentially irreparable damage to public trust not just in this generation of politicians but to our entire democratic process  It is high time we made a decision. So far, Parliament has done everything possible to avoid making a choice. Motion after motion and amendment after amendment has been tabled without Parliament ever deciding what it wants. All MPs have been willing to say is what they do not want. I passionately hope MPs will find a way to back the deal Iaposve negotiated with the EU, a deal that delivers on the result of the referendum and is the very best deal negotiable. And I will continue to work night and day to secure the support of my colleagues, the DUP and others for this deal. But I am not prepared to delay Brexit any further than the th of June. Some argue that Iaposm making the wrong choice and I should ask for a longer extension to the end of the year or beyond to give more time for politicians to argue over the way forward. That would mean asking you to vote in European elections nearly three years after our country decided to leave. What kind of message would that send  And just how bitter and isive would that election campaign be at a time when the country desperately needs bringing back together. Some have suggested holding a second referendum. I donapost believe thataposs what you want and it is not what I want. We asked you the question already and youaposve given us your answer. Now you want us to get on with it. And that is what I am determined to do.

A short extension of Brexit until the end of June is now considered likely followng a statement from the president of the European Council. Mr Tusk, a former Polish prime minister, told a press conference in Brussels: In the light of the consultations that I have conducted over the past days, I believe that a short extension would be possible.  But it would be conditional on a positive vote on the Withdrawal Agreement in the House of Commons. The question remains open as to the duration of such an extension. Mr Tusk indicated that it should be possible for leaders of the remaining EU  to approve his plan at a summit in the Belgian capital starting on Thursday. He said that while he did not foresee the need for another extraordinary summit next week, he would not hesitate to call onenecessary. If the leaders approve my recommendations and there is a positive vote in the House of Commons next week, we can finalise and formalise the decision on extension in the written procedure, he said. However,there is such a need, I will not hesitate to invite the members of the European Council for a meeting to Brussels next week.

The Prime Ministeraposs threat to resign will grab the headlines but it should distract from the tact she was not just in denial about her predicament, the state of the Brexit crisis and the virtual collapse of her Government, she refused to take any responsibility for the chaos she has created. Jeremy Corbyn began by trying to take the role of the statesman, rather belatedly, in the absence of any leadership from the party on the other side of the Commons and invited the Prime Minister to meet him today to discuss the way forward. This lead to a rather tedious bout of point scoring over which leader had been most forthcoming in trying to reach a compromise. Mrs May then went through all the iations of Brexit the Commons had rejected - a second referendum, no deal and Corbyn’s plan - but failed to mention it had also twice voted down her own deal.    Corbyn then pressed her on how she would use any extension were one to be granted by the EU. The Prime Minister then said she had already answered that point in reply to a previous question. She hadn’t. This was an insulting answer to a reasonable question. The MPs and the public deserved better, not least because as the PM was speaking Downing Street released the letter to the EU setting out the reasons for the extension request. She was more willing to communicate her thinking on Twitter than to MPs. But Mrs May had not even got to the depths of the abasement to which she is capable of sinking.    She then lectured the Commons on its failure to deliver Brexit. “This House has indulged itself on Europe for too long,” she said. Perhaps the Prime Minister had forgotten that Brexit was inflicted on the country by her party  Perhaps she had wiped from her memory that she had repeatedly pulled votes, delaying the process still further  Perhaps she no longer believes that holding the Government to account is an essential aspect of any democracy  The session ended where it began with a Prime Minister refusing to accept there is no support for her deal and unwilling to countenance any other option. It is hard to think of something more indulgent.  Score: Jeremy Corbyn  Theresa May  ,],totalVotes:,votesToShow:,mentometerId:,publicationId:,callbackUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  status,voteActionUrl:https:www.mirror poll-ws poll  vote,closed:,closedMessage:This poll has been closed!,hideResults:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : # , title : Mirror Politics ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\""},{"url":null,"title":"commuters terrified construction workers islamaphobic","story":"NewsWorkers shocking racist rant on London train over New Zealand mosque attackThe man ranted to commuters on a London Overground train about his hatred of Muslims just days after the mosque terror attack in New ZealandShareCommentsByTalia Shadwell:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video racist-commuter-filmed-shocking-anti-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News ,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA racist construction worker has been filmed ranting about his hatred of Muslims on a London train just days after terror attacks in mosques in New Zealand killed .

In the footage, the man appears drunk. As other commuters sit uncomfortably around him and some appear to walk away, the man, standing in the aisle, references the New Zealand terror attacks as he goes on a several-minute-long tirade. He can be heard to swear at , before saying: Who do they think they are  Just kill them. Forty nine Muslims got killed the other day, and I was like aposcome on mate you have to do thatapos.

Twice-orced Ade Goodchild, , said he had no plans to settle down but warned potential gold diggers he is no soft touch. The former metal factory worker said: “Anybody who I think I couldn’t have pulled before has got no chance, because I haven’t suddenly become more attractive overnight – just my wallet has. “I do like tall redheads, mind.” Ade sounded like football legend George Best as he joked while quaffing champagne: “I’ll spend my money on wine and women – and waste the rest.” But after two failed marriages he insisted “love would have to come find me”.    Cousin Michelle Lintern, , of Caerphilly, said the relatives would happily help only child Ade avoid gold diggers. She said: “He’s a bit vulnerable with all that money but we are all very protective of him. We are all about the same age and very close.” Ade’s first we Catherine Berkeley said she wished him well and did not want a penny of his winnings. She told the Mirror: “I could not be more pleased, it could not have happened to a nicer man.” She said they met in the pubs of Hereford when she was just  and married in , before orcing in . She added: “We were so young when we got together – it feels like a dferent letime.” Ade said he orced from his second we Susannah only two years ago. The pair, who were married for  years, have stayed friends and she still walks his labradoodles Taz and Mutley. He said: “I called to say I’d won £million on the lottery but she didn’t believe me, she knows I’m a leg puller. We are still in touch, there’s no bitterness.”    But he declined to reveal whether his ex would get a cut of his winnings although close pals revealed it is more than likely he will share some of his fortune with her. However Susannah’s parents, Malcolm and Lesley Smith, said she had told them: “I don’t want a penny of his winnings. He can keep the lot.” Mrs Smith, , reportedly said Susannah now works -hour days doing two jobs. She said: “Poor Susannah had been unhappy for years. She said he’d let himself go, become very self-centred. She put up with it for as long as she could but she’d had enough. “He wouldn’t do anything around the house or garden, or even walk their two labradoodle dogs. Even after they split up, she had to go back to the house every day to walk them.” Sports-mad Ade, whose family is originally from South Wales, revealed he celebrated finding out about his win on Saturday by watching Wales win the rugby union Grand Slam with his dad.    He said: “We had slightly fancier beer, nice Italian beer, sent out for pizza and had some spicy wings – the sort of things millionaires do every Saturday.” He now wants a new house with a jacuzzi, “a few staff” and dream holidays to places such as the Grand Canyon and the Pyramids. He said: “I’m not a gardener but I’d like a bit of space for the dogs and a nice spot for my hammock on sunny days, so it would be good to have someone to take care of the view for me. I think I could also get used to a driver and even my own cook.” Ade bought the winning ticket at a Co-op in Hereford, where staff said he was a “genuinely nice, lovely guy”.    He went public about the jackpot at a four-star hotel in Great Malvern, Worcs, today. He said: “I’m not one of these winners who is going to say this win won’t change me. “It b****y well will, or at least I’ll give it a damn good go.” Ade revealed that his first priority is to go looking at new houses with his parents. He said: “Like all parents, they worry about my mortgage, bills and how long I will have to work for. I’ve told my parents they can stop saving now and spend my inheritance.” Ade said he plans to help his extended family financially too, after having to keep the win a secret from them at a pub family gathering in Abergavenny on Sunday. He said: “I didn’t want to spoil our day. Most of them know now though. I am going to enjoy sitting down and chatting about how I might be able to help them.” Ade admitted he was not perfect, but said: “What man of my age hasn’t made mistakes  “I have regrets but I hope I haven’t hurt or upset anyone.” He added: “I’m certainly not a stupid man, but I have done stupid things, I think now I have learned from them and just put them all behind me.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middletons family business sheds","story":"NewsKate Middletons family business sheds half of staff amid fears for futureParty Pieces is owned by Kates mum Carole Middleton - but some staff were given chop before Christmas with more axed yesterdayShareCommentsByAndrew Gilpin:,  MAR NewsCatherine, Duchess of Cambridge and her mother Carole Middleton \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Duchess of Cambridge family firm where she used to work part time has shed half of its staff amid fears for the future, according to reports.

Harry was on good form as he chatted to staff, children and visitors at St Vincentaposs Catholic Primary School in Acton, west London.

Hannah Tittensor, , from Belfast, says she first became addicted to having a tan after ing from a holiday to turkey in . The beauty therapist loved the transformation from her paler skin to a dark tan so much, she decided to start having sunbeds and regular top-up injections. The aposunder-the-counterapos jabs include a substance called Melanotan, which users take to go darker more quickly under sunlight or sun beds. And while Hannah admits she is at the “extreme end’, she says she is part of a growing trend in tanning in Belfast, with many using the illegal drug.    Despite side effects that include feeling sick, her boyfriend Ben Dunlop, , also uses the injections. “Everyone is doing it,” said Hannah. “It’s become a trend in the city.” “I use the sun bed for about fteen minutes, three times a week. “Ben and I do the injections for about one week each month, where you have an injection before you go on the sun bed each time. “I just use the injections to top me up for that week, and then I stay really tanned all month. “I absolutely love the colour I go and much prefer this than spray or fake tan that’s smelly and makes you feel dirty. And it gets all over your clothes and bed.”Like many, Hannah regularly posts photos of herself on social media and has been using Instagram since , before she became hooked on tanning.   But when she uploaded the first photo of herself on the  holiday in Turkey - when she revealed her new ultra-dark skin for the first time - she started to get hate messages and online abuse. “I had an amazing tan but I felt like dying,” she said. “People told me I looked like an alien, that I looked ugly,” she said. “Some people accused me of trying to look like a black woman. I’m not trying to do that at all, I just like the way my skin looks healthy and glowing with a tan. “Some girls can’t live without getting their nails or hair done and for me its tanning. “I’m always playing around with my look . I’ve been a skater girl, sometimes had more of a surfer hippy look, and now I like to look like this.” In January , when Hannah combined her new skin colour with box braids - a type of hair braiding more commonly worn by African and African-American people - she received a fresh waves of attacks. “People were commenting on my photos accusing me of cultural appropriation and even saying that I was racist, just because of how I looked,” she said.    “I’m not racist at all. I’m just a white girl who likes to be overly-tanned. “It seems like I am the worst person in the world just for tanning sometimes. It seems to offend people sometimes and I’m not trying to. It seems pretty harmless to me. “Every girl I see on instagram is tanned. I know I’m at the extreme end but I like the way I look. I feel like me.” Hannah says she first found out about tanning injections when her brother Jack tried them in . “He came in one day and was suddenly really tanned,” she said. “We asked how he did it and he said it was Melanotan.” Trainee barber Ben has been using sun beds since he was  and has now been taking tanning injections for three to four years. He keeps fit with bodybuilding and regularly goes with Hannah to the local gym, where the couple like keep in shape.    Melanotan is widely promoted on bodybuilding websites and forums, aimed at bodybuilders who want to enhance the effect of the way their muscles look with deeper tans. “Bodybuilding has gotten really popular in Belfast, and so have the tanning injections with it,” said Ben. “I don’t compete in bodybuilding or go on stage, I just like to work out and feel healthy. Tanning is a big part of bodybuilding. A lot of bodybuilders take tanning injections. “My mum thinks I look like an idiot but I don’t care, I like it. “I worry about Hannah sometimes because cancer runs her family, and she goes into the sun bed for longer than me usually. I normally do  minutes while she does longer. “I don’t have a history of cancer in my family so I don’t really worry about myself. I don’t know much about the side effects of the injections.”   Users of Melanotan are able to buy it through Facebook groups and some beauty salons and gyms.The vial is mixed with water and injected under the skin. Hannah and Ben take around iu dosage each time they use it. “The injection doesn’t hurt,” she said. “You just feel a bit sick and lose your appetite for a couple of days.” The substance is created in a lab and increases the levels of a natural pigment in the skin called melanin, which responds to sunlight and causes darker skin, hair and eyes. Increasing it in your body using tanning injections allows your skin to go darker under the ultravioletlight of the sun or a sun bed. The UK National Health Servicewarns people on its website against using Melanotan, saying it is not legal because it has not been tested and approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency .    Because it is injected and users might share needles, other concerns about Melanotan include the spread of HIV and other blood-borne diseases like hepatitis or infections from injecting non-sterilised water. Despite the other health risks of too much sunlight or sun beds, Hannah is not ready to quit tanning. “One of the main reasons I do it is I don’t need to wear much makeup,” she said. Tanned skin looks better and it saves me lots of time going out or to work. “I’m not going to go any darker at the moment but I probably will in the summer, and that will spark off all the abuse again. “But it’s OK, we’re kind of used to it now.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk high streets lose 1200","story":"NewsUK High Streets lose , estate agents in ONE yearExclusive: Britains High Street crisis sees firms reeling from online agents, struggling market and rising costsShareCommentsByGraham HiscottHead of Business:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSome , estate agent branches closed last year, adding to Britain’s high street crisis.

Instead, she delivered a dishonest statement that blamed everyone but herself for the crisis. The Prime Minister took the dangerous and unworthy step of trying to pitch herself on the side of the people against Parliament. She claimed that MPs were thwarting Brexit by refusing to make a decision but failed to mention she has repeatedly blocked calls for the Commons to hold a series of indicative votes so they could find a way forward.    She said voters were tired of the endless hold-ups, without admitting her dithering and inaction were the main cause of the delays. An issue that should have been resolved weeks ago now rests on MPs having to make a decision against the tyranny of the clock. The Mirror set out a sensible alternative for Brexit based on a Norway-style deal which could command a majority in the Commons. Rather than test support for such an option, the PM has led the country to this clf edge by blindly pursuing a deal already rejected twice. It is a damning indictment of Mrs May’s handling of Brexit that with eight days before we could leave the EU, the world’s fth biggest economy still has no idea what its trading relationship will be with its largest market. A PM who put her country in such a position should have resigned. She and she alone is responsible for this national humiliation.    Sick slaughter If you want a definition of cowardice, it is a trophy hunter who uses a high-powered rle to shoot a sleeping animal.

I thought that was too much time added on but, having said that, it’s not the reason,” he said.“We had a great opportunity on the counter attack with two minutes to go and we’ve got to be better.“That’s the reason we are where we are because we’ve been going into so many good areas in each of the last few games and we’re not punishing teams.“We didn’t do what Celtic did. They were ruthless and that’s why we’ve not picked up enough points since I’ve come.“There has been plenty of positive play, plenty of areas we’ve got into but we need to be better in the final third.“It’s the only thing that’s going to get you out of the situation that you’re in – winning games.”Returning to Madden’s decision to play on for so long, Jim confirmed he had spoken to the referee to get his reasoning.“He said there were a couple of head knocks, so that was the reason why. It’s generally about three but there were a couple of knocks, so I could understand maybe four.

The society board have now informed Dens financial director David Gray and their own members of the decision to hang on to all their shares.Given there’s no provision in society rules for the sale of any shares and their rejection of the original attempt to get their veto-holding shares, this latest move comes as no surprise, particularly as even an improved offer of £, for the ordinary shares was viewed as derisory by many members.Dundee are now likely to undertake a full share issue that would allow Keyes to break through the % barrier but is likely to entail administrative costs running into five figures."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee uniteds game at dunfermline called off","story":"Dundee United#s game at Dunfermline has been called off.The referee has deemed the East End Park pitch unplayable due to being waterlogged.The Fe club had released a statement at am saying there were no plans to hold a pitch inspection because the pitch was considered playable.

I was quite shocked. But the more you play, the fitter you get – it’s been good fun.“It’s good to see people from dferent backgrounds, age groups and sexes all getting involved.

They’ve managed just one win in four games.And as well as a dip in performance over that period, United have struggled to find the back of the net from open play.In the last five games, only Cammy Smith’s close-range opener in the draw at Falkirk was not from a set-piece and the four other efforts to hit the mark have all been from the boot of Nicky Clark, either from the penalty spot or free-kicks.The effort to improve on that will not be helped by the absence of main striker Pavol Safranko tonight and again when Alloa visit on Saturday, because he is now away on international duty with Slovakia.The other experienced No  in the squad, Osman Sow, would not have been fit for the weekend after aggravating a troublesome calf problem early on in the last outing down at Partick Thistle.Sow was being checked in training yesterday but the chances are he will not make tonight and will even be a major doubt for this weekend.That being the case, Robbie has a big call to make when it comes to how he sets up his attack for the next couple of outings.He does at least have Peter Pawlett back available after the one-game suspension he picked up for his red card in the league win over Inverness. Theof the former Aberdeen man could see Clark pushed right up top and him used in a supporting role.Another option would be to use Matty Smith as the main striker but given the young attacker has not started since the Tannadice win over Dunfermline back on January , that would be a big ask.Whatever way he decides to go, tonight and in the coming games, the boss will be looking for both more chances to be created and a much better conversation rate.That will be a challenge against a County team that have hit league-winning form since mid-January.Their only defeat in  games in all competitions was when they went down to Inverness on penalties in a Scottish Cup replay."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-launches-veggie-happy-meals-as-greggs-sells-vegan-sausage-rolls","story":"MCDONALDrsquoS restaurants across Glasgow have launched their first-ever vegetarian Happy Meal for children from today."},{"url":null,"title":"richard-madden-flashback-to-when-rising-actor-spoke-to-the-evening-times","story":"RENFREWSHIRE actor Richard Madden has picked up a Golden Globe for his role in gripping BBC drama Bodyguard."},{"url":null,"title":"hugh-jackman-in-glasgow-how-to-get-tickets-without-using-ticketmaster","story":"AS is usually the norm when big acts announce gigs, music fans have been unable to buy tickets to see Hugh Jackman in Glasgow through Ticketmaster, despite him having announced a staggering three-night run in May."},{"url":null,"title":"taking-your-car-abroad-after-brexit-looks-like-youll-be-needing-a-green-card","story":"THE prospect of a no-deal Brexit, meaning no transition period, will mean insurance lsquogreen cardsrsquo will be required for UK drivers venturing across the Channel or into the Republic of Ireland from March , ."},{"url":null,"title":"princes-street-evacuation-suspicious-package-found-day-after-glasgow-university-on-lockdown","story":"BREAKING:Glasgow Universityrsquos Dumfries campus evacuated after lsquosuspicious packagersquo found.

It is also recognition of their consistency for Aberdeen.”Although there is a pride for McInnes in having players involved with Scotland, there is also the worry his chargeshaving picked up injuries.The Dons lost centre-back Mikey Devlin for almost three months earlier this season after an ankle injury sustained in November during training with Scotland.McInnes added: “I’m pleased we’ve got players going on international duty. We’ve got pride, but there’s still that bit of dread for us with players being away about them potentially getting injured.“Obviously any player that is away on international duty is a very important player for us.“That goes right through the age groups right the way up to the senior team.“So it’s great that our players are recognised at international level.“But we just need to make sure they come back in a positive frame of mind and free from injury.”McInnes also believes seeing Shinnie and McKenna in the Scotland set-up gives other players in his Aberdeen squad something to aspire to.Earlier this term, Devlin was in the squad for the UEFA Nations League clashes with Albania and Israel before having to pull out due to injury, while winger Gary Mackay-Steven played in October’s - friendly defeat to Portugal and McInnes has said previously midfielder Lewis Ferguson – currently on Under- duty – should aim to make the step-up to the senior squad.McInnes said: “When there is evidence that you can be a full international at Aberdeen it gives others something to aim for.“It takes away that argument that maybe existed in the past about maybe needing to leave to be an international.“The evidence is there now with Shinnie and McKenna.”"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/02/MPU-offers.jpg ","title":"global energy group takes over aberdeen based apollo offshore","story":"Global Energy Group has bought a majority stake in Aberdeen-based Apollo Offshore Engineering, forming a new contractor firm.The new company will be named Global Engineering and Construction, combining Apollo’s brownfield engineering capability with Global’s integrity and constructionision.Global EC will have a headcount of around  and will be an engineering procurement and construction contractor exclusively focused on services for mature fields in the North Sea.The value of the deal has not been disclosed."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 01","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe conditions being endured by refugees on a remote Greek island might seem of little importance to folk living in Argyll, but Pam Gregory spends time helping make their lives easier.More volunteers are desperately needed to assist as conditions worsen during the winter and Samos Volunteers would love to hear from anyone with the inclination to help.Pam#s dedication and the support of the Craignish community deserve great credit.

Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"honours even for red star in argyll derby","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ropework played host to this keenly contested local derby which was watched by a healthy crowd on Saturday February .And for the second time this season, Red Star and Campbeltown Pupils shared the points in a match both sides will feel they could have won.Both sides were struggling for fluency in the opening stages but Red Star settled first and grabbed the opening goal after  minutes. A long ball to the right hand side was met by Ryan Caskie who cut the ball back to Stuart McLean. The youngster took a touch before slotting past the Pupils# goalkeeper to give Star a - lead.Star continued to press and doubled their lead when Coll McCallum robbed the Pupils# defender on the edge of the box before cutting the ball across goal. The unfortunate Pupils# defender could only ert the ball into the empty net, with McLean waiting on a tap in. The game continued at a frantic pace, however, there was no further scoring in the first half and Star went in with a - advantage.Pupils came out with purpose in the second half as they looked to force themselves back into the game, however, it was a howler from Red Star which allowed them back into the match.A square ball across the back resulted in a mix-up between Star keeper Luke Kalache and defender Ben Forbes which allowed Donald McCallum to prod the ball home from just inside the box and Pupils were back in the game at - with eight second half minutes gone.The home side didn’t recover from this and you could sense a nervousness that gave the visitors plenty encouragement. The equaliser arrived with  minutes remaining when good play from Pupils down the right by Soudan saw him get a low cross in which was met by the on-rushing run of Ryan Deans and he finished well to level the score at -.This set up a frantic finish and both sides could have nicked it towards the end. Pupils went close with a headed effort which was clawed to safety while at the other end there was a goalmouth scramble which Star couldn’t convert and both sides had to settle for a draw in the end as referee Jimmy Litster blew for full time.Red Star were dealt a blow as it emerged that captain Aaron Moore suffered a dislocated shoulder. Hopefully this will not keep him out for too long.On Saturday February , Star have another important home game as they look to move off the bottom of the table when they take on Claremont AFC.

Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"eyesore burns house knocked down","story":"South Ayrshire Councils Burns House, Burns Statue Square.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailEyesore Burns House is set to be torn down this upcoming year.

The move means historic Burns Statue Square will be completely transformed. The decision was announced as part of the council’s budget for the year, which comes into effect next month. The cost to flatten the office block is estimated to be £. million. Council leader, the SNP’s Douglas Campbell said: “We will relocate staff from Burns House into properties already owned by the council in Ayr and other town centres to continue to support the local day time economy.” Speaking during his budget speech, he added:”This will result in the demolishing of Burns House commencing during this financial year.” Meanwhile across the road the crumbling Station Hotel remains covered over as question marks hang over its future. It is understood ScotRail staff will neverto the dangerous building. It is believed they are to be housed in new portable cabins across the railway line at empty ground on Station Road. The option of a new new transport hub being built in the vicinity of Burns Statue Square has been mooted in the past. But no solid plan has emerged. Councillor Campbell said: “We maintain dialogue with the Scottish Government, Transport Scotland and Network Rail about future investment at the station. Once we are clearer about their intentions we will begin discussions on the future of Burns Statue Square. “ The council’s former regeneration contractor Ayr Renaissance was tasked with hiring consultants to redesign the space at the top of the High Street.

Police objected to McLelland getting a personal licence at the council’s licensing board meeting heard last week, McLelland, , of Main Street, Auchinleck carried out the crime in November . Police Sergeant David Dougan told councillors McLelland was sentenced to a community payback order at Ayr Sherf Court last year as punishment. But McLelland said she was plagued by anti-social behaviour outside at her home in Main Street. She told the board: “I love kids. I regret it.” She claims she has had problems with people “chapping her door” and urinating in her garden. She rushed out to the nearby bus shelter during one incident, she told the meeting.. McLelland said: “I went out. It wasn’t even raw bleach. It is not an excuse. I shouldn’t have done it.” She claimed the bottle was kicked out of her hand and spilled over the victim. But the meeting heard McLelland pled guilty in court. The shop worker said: “I am not in the habit of going out and fighting with kids. “I am a -year-old woman.” She added: “Everybody in this le makes mistakes. Nobody in this world is perfect.” She told the meeting she had phoned the police numerous times to report anti-social behaviour at her property. Councillors adjourned the meeting to discuss whether she should be handed a licence. Ontheir opinion was split with three councillors voting to grant her application and the same number against. Board Chair Councillor Tom Cook had the ruling say and decided to grant McLelland’s licence. He said giving her the licence would not increase her chances of committing a similar offence in the future. Councillors George Mair, John Campbell and Fiona Campbell voted to refuse the licence. Councilors Drew Filson, Lillian Jones supported Councillor Cook’s view to grant it. Councillor Cook said he would grant the licence “albeit with reservations.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnEast Ayrshire CouncilCourtsJusticeAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"shopper yelled get back your","story":"NewsShopper yelled \"Get back to your own country, you Iraqi b******\" to Ayr Lidl workerManus McGhee avoided jail after his foul mouth outburst at the store.ShareByAyrshire Post:,  MAR NewsThe outburst took place at Lidl in Ayr \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA man who was asked to leave Ayr’s Lidl store went back in to racially abuse a staff member, writes Edwin Lawrence.

Super-fit Fiona McBlane was , practised yoga and cycled and was in London lapping up a glamorous working le in the music industry for companies such as EMI and Smash Hits. But during a Christmas visit home to Ayrshire she fell unwell with leg, arm and head pain. Such was her distress she admitted herself to hospital. First the minor stroke hit - on January ,  - and then the searing biggie nine days later. It left her semi-paralysed in hospital for  months, unable to speak, hardly walking and retaining very limited brain capacity. That was when Clan McBlane rallied round to give her the best future they could. They had been advised the best place for her was an old folks home but they stood firm. Once Fiona was fit enough to leave hospital she was brought into the bosom of the family in Prestwick. Twelve years on at the age of , Fiona is battling away and has got to the stage where she has joined the gym at Prestwick Tennis Club.

We spend time together and Fiona enjoys the company. “Despite the extent of her disability, she does brilliantly. “Doctors told us that her friends would eventually tail off but Fiona’s haven’t .

We don’t know what the future will hold for Fiona but we do know that whatever it is we will face it together.” There are , strokes in Scotland every year. Angela Macleod at the Stroke Association said: “Our latest research shows that by training and taking part in a Resolution Run you are helping to lower your stroke risk. “The funds raised by each runner means we can reach out to more stroke survivors and their families to offer the support that they may need to rebuild their lives.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnstrokeAyrAyr NewsPrestwickRunningCharity"},{"url":null,"title":"upper crust roost alloway","story":"NewsAn Upper Crust roost in AllowayAyrshire Post Property of the WeekShareByStephen Houston:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR News\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThere are few better places to bring up a family than the secluded suburban streets of Alloway.

how does a small childs cross pose a risk to anyone \"And from what we were told, they were going to inform familiesa stone required work to make it safe.\"There are now broken gravestones lying all over our cemetery - this wasnt a safety inspection.\"Scottish Borders Council is responsible for  cemeteries across the region.And they have health and safety obligations for all employees, contractors and visitors to each of the graveyards.Although headstones are the responsibility of the lair-holder, due to the age of many graves tracing families is dficult.A five-year rolling programme of safety checks began in September with  cemeteries earmarked for the initial checks.But for several families the heavy-handed testing regime - which has left many memorials broken - has come as a shock.One daughter, who we agreed not to name, said: \"My parents grave is neither old nor what you would describe as large, yet it has been taken from its base.\"I have been really upset by this -I or any of my family had known the stone was loose we would have had it repaired.\"Nobody has been in touch with me or my brother.\"According to the Scottish Borders Councils own guidelines on the testing procedures, an initial sight test would be followed,required, by a gentle hand push.All memorials were to be classed as either stable, slight movement or unsafe.And only memorials found to be in a dangerous condition will be cordoned off and or made safe.The guidance also states that they will ensure the work is undertaken with due respect and only when absolutely necessary.Scottish Borders Council has defended the testing procedures by the contracted company.A spokesman for the authority told us: \"The council took the decision to test all the headstones in the old section of Peebles Cemetery, regardless of size and age, following a risk assessment.\"This is part of a phased approach to testing which sees sections of cemeteries categorised based on estimated footfall, age, location and size of the memorials.\"So far the majority of unstable memorials tested across the Borders have been made safe by socketing, which means keeping the headstone upright with the majority of the inscription still visible for families and visitors to read.\"This is a recognised approach which balances the cultural importance associated with these historic memorials and the need to keep our cemeteries safe for the public to visit.\"Socketing is the preferred technique compared to other alternative methods such as lying flat, staking, banding or full repair, all of which carry signicant consequences to the future stability of the memorials or signicant costs.\"A total of  headstones were tested in Peebles Cemetery with  deemed unsafe.Council bosses have admitted they will discuss issues over stones being broken during the inspection.The spokesman added: \"We accept that during this signicant safety programme, and considering the nature of the memorials that we are dealing with, there will be occasions where a memorial can become damaged while being made safe.\"If anyone notices a memorial which they have a legal interest in and which they believe has been damaged during the process of making it safe, they can contact the council to discuss the matter further.\"Other graveyards which are included in the initial phase of inspections are Innerleithen, Wairds , Shawfield , Ashkirk, Earlston, Heriot, Lilliesleaf, Kelsoand Kelso , Ancrum, Denholm, Wellogateand Wilton , Ayton, Duns, Lennel and Eyemouth.Babies graves, war graves and many brokenWhere a memorial is classied as unsafe and there is an immediate safety concern, thememorial will be made safe. If a memorial is cordoned off or pocketed, the family, who areresponsible for the memorial can contact us and arrange for it to be made safe themselves.Memorials will be laid flatthere is no other practical way of making them safe.If it is found that a large number of memorials are unsafe within a section of the cemetery,we will fence off the whole area.

The objectors also presented evidence to the committee showing how their own planning policies were being ignored by their officials.Peebles Community Council and many residents objected to the land at South Parks site being earmarked for development in the Local Development Plan back in .Mr Turnbull said: ldquoWhat makes objectors particularly annoyed is the notion that once building sites have been included in Local Development Plans, their inclusion cannot be questioned.\"Their views then were ignored just as their views have been totally ignored now. One of the questions that needs to be asked is, why Mr Turnbull said the conduct of the planning committee with the housing application was ldquoappalling and added that the system is loaded in favour of developers.He added: ldquoWell over  dferent objectors submitted some very detailed evidence to planners who ignored it.\"This has brought many objectors to question the validity of the planning process. It would appear that this process is designed to allow developers to build as and when they want and they can appealtheir application is refused.ldquoObjectors on the other hand have no right of appeal given that they have no right of appeal it is surely essential that they are given a fair hearing where evidence is properly considered.ldquoIn the South Parks case, Councillor Fullarton made comments regarding the Caledonian Road being wide and safe, based on his knowledge of over  years ago - no one challenged him.ldquoWhat has caused so much anger was that not a single councillor on the committee knew enough about Peebles to question Councillor Fullartonrsquos assertion. It may be that the planning committee has insufficient time to deal properly with these more complicated and contentious applicationsthat is the case then something has to change.ldquoThey simply failed to understand the issues before them nor the tremendous amount of anger within our community.\"The Scottish Government has launched an initiative called Democracy Matters, which aims to improve the level of involvement of local communities.Mr Turnbull continued: ldquoWhat is the pointplanning officers can write what they want, ignore government guidance and legislation, which is then allowed to stand by councillors who either do not have the knowledge to challenge them or the will to do so. For democracy to matter the peoplesrsquo voice needs to be heard.The community leader says the democratic deficit will be brought into sharp focus with the next Local Development plan, and heeded a warning to elected councillors to be prepared to answer why Peebles is mooted for major development when Scottish Borders Council is not prepared to develop infrastructure first.Scottish Borders Council strongly refutes the claims that councillors and officials ignored the views of the community.A spokesperson said: ldquoAll planning decisions require the delicate balancing of a range of policy objectives and other material factors, including the views expressed by the Community Council.\"The two recent planning applications in Peebles highlighted how dficult that can be and the complexity of the decision making process. Both proposals were subject to detailed analysis, which was reflected in the presentation of the cases by officers and the y debate members had on these applications.ldquoIt is clear that a considerable amount of time was spent considering the points and issues made both for and against the proposed developments. Indeed, both applications were revised to take into consideration the views expressed by local residents and the Community Council.ldquoUltimately, and after considering all of the evidence before them, the Committee came to the view that it could support one of the applications, which was the development at South Parks. The application at Tweedbridge Court was refused."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-peer-lord-steel-suspended-from-lib-dems-after-giving-evidence-about-cyril-smith","story":"BORDERS peer Lord Steel has been suspended from the Liberal Democrats, pending an investigation into evidence he gave to an inquiry about child abuse allegations against former MP Sir Cyril Smith.The move, announced by the Scottish Liberal Democrats, comes after Lord Steel, a former Scottish Parliament presiding officer, gave evidence to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuseon Wednesday.The party had already announced they have started disciplinary proceedings against him, after he told the probe a conversation with Smith left him \"assuming\" the allegations were correct, but the party did not investigate them.The decision followed a meeting of senior figures within the Scottish party on Thursday evening.In a subsequent statement, the Scottish Liberal Democrats said: \"Following the evidence concerning Cyril Smith given by Lord Steel to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse on th March , the office bearers of the Scottish Liberal Democrats have met and agreed that an investigation is needed.\"The party membership of Lord Steel has been suspended pending the outcome of that investigation. That work will now commence.\"It is important that everyone in the party, and in wider society, understands the importance of vigilance and safeguarding to protect people from abuse, and that everyone has confidence in the seriousness with which we take it.\"We appreciate the dficult work that the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is doing on behalf of the victims and survivors of abuse, and the country as a whole.\"At the inquiry Lord Steel denied he had been \"hiding his head in the sand\" over the child abuse allegations made against the former Rochdale MP.Lord Steel said he asked the late politician in  about claims that he abused boys at a Rochdale hostel, and found they dated back to Smiths time as a Labour councillor in the s.He told the inquiry he came away from the conversation with Smith \"assuming\" he had committed the offences, because he did not deny them.Lord Steel recalled Smith had told him police had investigated the claims and taken no action.The IICSA heard no formal inquiry was then held by the Liberal Party into the claims.On the suggestion that no action was taken then because Lord Steel did not want to get involved in a nasty confrontation with Smith, he told the hearing: \"I wouldnt have been hiding my head in the sand.\"These allegations all related to a period some years before he was even an MP and before he was even a member of the party, therefore it did not seem to me that I had any position in the matter at all.\"Smith, who was an MP for Rochdale between  and , is accused of sexually abusing a number of boys.Allegations against him found a greater public spotlight after he died in .,params: .pushLord Steels conversation with Smith was prompted by a story in Private Eye.It came after the Rochdale Alternative Press published a story in  saying police had investigated Smith over allegations of abuse against teenagers at the Cambridge House hostel in the town.Lord Steel told the inquiry: \"He accepted the story was correct.

The Langlee Woods is very popular with walkers, and cyclists, and I know therersquos a good and a bad with everything and some of the cyclists come down the tracks without any idea of where theyrsquore going and who might be going to meet them.ldquoThe other thing that concerns is me is that in Langlee and Ladhope golf course, I donrsquot want to see any parking in these areas.ldquoIt has to be discouraged. The road up to Langlee Mains Farm is not suitable for the type of cycles yoursquore talking about, itrsquos a narrow, twisty road with zones of invisibility.ldquoIf there is to be parking, I suggest you look where.Councillors voted unanimously to submit the plans to the public for consultation, and for a report to be brought back to the committee in the future.Council officers also confirmed that the trail network will require planning permission, which will give residents a second opportunity to submit their thoughts on the development."},{"url":null,"title":"iceland-store-boss-admits-ignoring-21-parking-tickets","story":"A SUPERMARKET manager has been hit with a four figure bill after ignoring a y string of parking tickets.David Humphries car was frequently ticketed over several months after being parked in a pay and display area behind the Iceland store in High Street, Galashiels, where he works.But the -year-old never paid the tickets or answered letters from the Scottish Borders Council asking him to reveal the identication of the driver, so the fines could be sent to the culprit.Now he has been fined a whopping pound, for ignoring the council letters - pound for each offence - and there is still a pound bill outstanding for the  original parking offences between April and July last year.Humphries of Bourtree Place, Hawick, pleaded guilty at Selkirk JP Court to a total of  charges.Procurator fiscal Graham Fraser told the court that there was no CCTV in the car park showing who had come to collect the car on the days of the offences and Humphries had never informed the council of the identity of the driver despite the repeated requests.But he pointed out Humphries worked in the Iceland store which is right beside the High Street car park.Mr Fraser also said that failing to reveal the identity of the driver carried a maximum penalty of pound, for each offence.He explained that the council had to go through the laborious process of establishing who the regular keeper of the vehicle was and to find out who the driver was for the penalty to be paid.Mr Fraser said:\"In relation to all these charges he ignored the correct parking penalty which was not paid.\"There were other people who could have used this car parkspace but have not been able to do so.\"The accuseds vehicle repeatedly committed the offences of being parked overtime.\"Who did that we do not know as the accused did not bother to communicate with the council and say who the driver was which is a legal requirement.\"Not guilty pleas to nine other charges relating to the parking offences were accepted by the Crown.Defence lawyer Colin Severin said his client was negotiating with the council about the outstanding parking fines.He added: \"He got to the point where he was bogged down with the volume of letters coming through and did not know how to react.\"Andrew Bramhall JP told Humphries that ulging the identity of the identity of the driver when an offence is committed was an important part of the Road Traffic Act legislation.He said: \"The onus was on you and it has mounted up considerably.\"Mr Bramhall said he would have fined Humphries pound for each offence but restricted the fine to pound due to the guilty plea.As there were  offences, the fine totalled pound -

proposing £, more for winter gritting, outwith the A which is covered by the contract with BEAR.This was against cuts in the road safety unit, an award-winning safety programme for young children, a cut in youth and adult learning, a cut in environmental warden services, which means a focus on more fines but less time for fly tipping and dog fouling and a cut to music tuition in schools.There were amendments lodged by Councillor Donald Kelly and myself, the SNP group and councillors George Freeman and Jean Moffat.While gritting our roads is important Councillor Kelly and I, along with other council opposition groups, thought the other considerations were important to our communities which strangely enough is also supported by our corporate plan.Alas the gritting won the day.Full motions and votes can be found on the council website.However it was more disappointing that Councillor Kelly and I included in our motion a scheme to change funding due for Helensburgh and Dunoon.Just more than £ million would be moved to the regeneration project of Tarbert Lochgilphead Ardrishaig.This was defeated by the rest of the council which was particularly galling.Money for Helensburgh had been questioned by its community council which felt that too much had already been spent.The money for Dunoon was because of poor procurement processes and a general #I want syndrome#

Lauder, it is said, was the first place he stopped after fleeing from the Battle of Prestonpans.ldquoI suppose we kind of followed in his footsteps, said my friend, ldquoalthough in a very dferent way and totally dferent circumstances of course. Folk round here donrsquot really know the story, but coming from the Pans it gave us an immediate connection.The actual house on Lauder High Street that Johnnie Cope arrived at is now gone, replaced over  years ago. But Lauder must look much as it did on that fateful day when Cope arrived, with his horse close to collapse with exhaustion.Johnnie Cope was the general commanding the British Army at Prestonpans on that fateful day, September , . The battle was a major victory for the Jacobites. Cope fled the scene of battle, but only when it was clearly lost. He eventually arrived at Berwick-upon-Tweed to give news of his own defeat. Ever since, popular tradition has mocked Cope for running away and not standing his ground and dying lsquohonourablyrsquo, as Colonel Gardiner of Bankton House did.This ridicule was encapsulated in a traditional popular song, and the chorus remains well-known:Hey, Johnnie Cope, are ye wauking yet Or are your drums a-beating yet If ye were wauking I wad waitTae gang to the coals irsquo the morning.The song pokes fun at Cope and concludes with a harsh indictment:Now Johnnie, troth, ye were na blateTae come wirsquo news orsquo your ain defeat,And leave your men in sic a straitSae early in the morning.There are earlier versions with slightly dferent words, but the sentiment remains the same: Johnnie Cope ran away and should be ashamed of himself for leaving his men. However, he was later found to have done his duty, and this reputation deemed unfair. But mud sticks, especially when a catchy tune is added to it.This popular song is believed to have been written by Adam Skirving, a farmer at Garleton in East Lothian. There is a story that he visited the battle site a few hours after the fighting. Perhaps he spoke to some eyewitnesses who saw Cope flee up the road to Birsley Brae, and therefore got the idea for the song. The road Cope took as he fled from the battle has ever after been called Johnnie Copersquos Road.Lauder is a short journey from Prestonpansgoing by car. It had been a while since I had last ventured over Soutra Hill and into the border country and I enjoyed the drive despite the wild weather, or perhaps partly because of it.But what was Copersquos journey like as he galloped over Soutra Hill with some of his dragoons  He must have paused at the summit and cast a glance at the view over East Lothian and screwed his eyes to find Prestonpans. The panic and terror by this time would have given way to dferent feelings, I suspect.He rode more or less the same way I took to Lauder but it would have taken him much longer with very dferent emotions. His arrival in the town would have been a bewildering spectacle for the locals. He later continued his flight to Coldstream, which he reached by nightfall.All this was in my head as we headed home to Prestonpans from Lauder the next day. I could almost see the ghosts of Cope and his dragoons gallop past us as we ventured over Soutra.As we drove, I re-told the story to my kids and we sang the song in the car. They know the story and the chorus well, as we have many times ventured along Johnnie Cope Road on the way to the rail station.By the road is Bankton House, once the home of Colonel Gardiner, who did not run but stood his ground, and paid the ultimate price with brutal death.There is a small doorsquocot by the house, and inside you will find a free but almost secret visitor centre created with the support of the Battle of Prestonpans Heritage Trust.The doorsquocot can only be reached via a walkway through the wood from the rail station during the day, and inside lsquoAuld Archiersquo tells the tale of the battle, and the le and death of Colonel Gardiner. On the wall is a model map of how the area looked at the time of the battle, with the route taken by Johnnie Cope clearly marked.Itrsquos all fascinating stuff which had been unexpectedly brought to my mind by the visit to Lauder to see old friends.But it was the emotions rather than the events that I reflected on most. The hatred caused by this civil war , the loss, suffering and misery of conflict which is so often hidden by a cloak of romanticism.Adam Watters, a Panner who lives and breathes local history, and re-enacts it for children and visitors alike, is clear on this. It is a fascinating period to study, and to have the history on our doorstep brings it alive. But as Adam has said, letrsquos enjoy that sense of history on our doorstep and have fun with it, but let us not glory battle, rather learn from it.I think Johnnie Cope, even though he was a military man, may well have agreed with Adam."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-council-cockenzie-revised-plan","story":"Inch Cape Offshore Ltd has been given approval to site the building ndash which will bring energy ashore from an offshore wind farm ndash on land at the former Cockenzie Power Station by Scottish Ministers.A planning application was initially lodged with East Lothian Council but was called in by the Scottish Government before a decision was made.That decision sparked anger after it was announced as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on an official visit to China, where she met representatives of Chinese state owned Red Rock, which owns Inch Cape.Now the company has presented a revised plan of the space it intends to use to Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council.The community council posted the new design on social media and revealed plans were under way for Inch Cape to host workshops in the local communities in the coming months.The image shows the substation on about a third of the original .-hectare footprint applied for.One of the biggest concerns raised by communities and the local authority, which owns the land, was that a substation dominating the old power station site would make it a no-go area for other developments.The new plans were welcomed by many on the community councilrsquos Facebook page, with one person saying: ldquoGood news, less sterilisation of the site.Ian Johnson, Inch Capersquos project manager, said: ldquoWe are continuing to engage with East Lothian Council and local community councils on options to signicantly reduce the footprint of the onshore transmission works and moving this to the west of the site.ldquoWhile this detailed design plan is subject to further technical assessments, consultation and approval from the council, we are taking steps to ensure remaining land is available for other developments."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-school-pupils-to-take-part-in-strike-against-climate-change","story":"The NBHS Eco Committee have encouraged students to travel by public transport to attend the rally campaigning for stronger government action to combat climate change.The Edinburgh protest is one of many around the world that are happening tomorrow morning, where school children are walking out of classes to protest climate change.The protest starts at am outside the Scottish Parliament.An East Lothian Council spokesperson said: ldquoWe want to support our young people as global citizens to have their voice and to be able to express their views on important matters such as climate change.\"The safety and wellbeing of our young people is of paramount importance to us.

The outcome is likely to be announced by Council president Donald Tusk and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in a joint press conference before Mrs May joins the other leaders for dinner.Mr Tusk has indicated the EU could agree an extension in principle, subject to Mrs May getting her Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament next week.Their agreement must be unanimous.If they do not offer an extension, the legal default is that the UK leaves on March  with or without a deal.

Like Forrest Gumprsquos box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get, apart from the nut cluster that is murder. This series has dealt with the topical subject of people trafficking, with DI Jimmy Perezbeing put through the emotional wringer. While he has encountered some right wrong lsquouns before, the buying and selling of human beings brought him face to face with real evil. Even his beloved daughter Cassie was threatened, which in Perez terms is grounds for declaring global thermonuclear war.Letters: Henshall has a cheekThe story began with a brother looking for his kidnapped sister. Five weeks in and Perez, Tosh and Sandy still hadnrsquot found Zezi. Time was running out, as was the will to live of Zezirsquos mother . Writer David Kane extracted every ounce of tension he could from the will-they-wonrsquot-they find her in time situation, culminating in one devilishly manipulative, and highly effective, scene.While one does not like to cast doubts on his professionalism, Perez has been rather distracted on this case by the presence on Shetland of the lovely Alice, who reckoned she couldnrsquot live without him, and to heck with her husband.Meanwhile, Toshdecided the IT manager at the local fish factory was quite a catch, but with the place closing down it looked like he might have to move south, unless Tosh could learn to trust again and declare her feelings.With all this hearts and flowers nonsense going on you can see why poor Zezi had to wait so long to be found. Then it was time for Perez to do what he does best: lock up the bad guys and apologise to everyone he had offended along the way. It is not easy being a non-caped crusader for justice. Mistakes can happen in the pursuit of truth, things are said that cannot be unsaid.How the series beganThe offer of dinner round at Perezrsquos was not enough to persuade Alice to stick around. ldquoYou need to be apart from the rest of us, she told Perez, condemning him to a letime of gazing out to sea with the collar of his reefer jacket turned up.Crushed like a grape by Alicersquos decision, there was nothing for him to do but go home, where Duncan, Cassiersquos birth father, Perezrsquos co-parent and lodger, and Maryrsquos estranged husband, was preparing to leave. Perez had upset Duncan in a previous series by arresting him during a murder inquiry. This time he had accused him of knowingly renting a property to people traffickers. Awk-ward!There had been enough love lost today, though. ldquoDonrsquot go, Perez pleaded, offering as a sweetener to invest in Duncanrsquos new bar. A cash-strapped Duncan accepted, which keeps him round for series six, where he will doubtless be unfairly accused of crimes against humanity and helicoptered to The Hague to stand trial.All that is in the television future. For now, Perez suggested the balm for all hurt feelings and rotten days: pizza. Duncan, distracted by paperwork, murmured, ldquoThat would be great, Mary. Perez stared at him, speechless. Oh dear. What now  But there it was, a twinkle ing to those baby blues, a smile spreading across his lips like melted mozzarella.ldquoSure thing, Fran, he replied, referring to his late we, the woman who had brought the two men together.

Andthat doesnrsquot work, she can put a motion to suspend standing orders.Of course, she needs a majority for that to work and she still hasnrsquot got one. The Brexit press seemed to believe that the Bercow Block was a blow in favour of Remain, but it was equally welcomed by hard Brexiters like Sir Bill Cash and Owen Paterson. Indeed, not having to put a third meaningful vote ndash MVndash this week arguably played into the Governmentrsquos hands too by giving the Prime Minister an excuse not to subject her deal to a third, humiliating defeat.:Nicola Sturgeon: Scotland is being shortchanged over Brexit negotiationsYou get the impression from listening to all parties to this parliamentary permashambles that theyrsquod all really rather prefer to stop voting altogether. A kind of fatalism has descended. MPs are exhausted with the effort of having to find new ways to say what they donrsquot want. The Government has started to talk in riddles, and Mrs May has lost her voice altogether. Brussels is finding our quaint parliamentary antics amusing, like a rerun of Monty Python. Angela Merkel and Mrs May seem agreed now that the best thing to do is suspend Article , so that everyone can continue doing nothing for another three months or even two years.Mind you, there have been some signicant developments beneath the surface non-events. Labour has finally started talking with the SNP, LibDems and supporters of a Norway Plus option. This will at least force Jeremy Corbyn to find new ways of not agreeing with them. Therersquos little dference between the European Economic Area option and his idea of a permanent customs union combined with regulatory alignment with the single market. Butthere is a way to prevent consensus breaking out across parties, no doubt theyrsquoll find one.Read more: Theresa May remains determinedAll the parties have done their best to prevent Parliament coming together behind the one option most MPs agree on. They all want to be able to blame each for whatever happens after Brexit Day. The SNP supported the single market EEA option in two white papers and one General Election manesto, but is now focused on a second referendum.For their part, many Tory and Labour Brexiters ndash the more sentient ones ndash are getting seriously worried that, by continuing to reject Mrs Mayrsquos deal, they may lose Brexit altogether. This is an entirely rational fear. About the only thing the Commons has managed to agree upon is that it doesnrsquot want a no-deal Brexit. Conservative websites like Guido Fawkes and Conservative Home are humming with arguments from Brexiters, like the former minister, Esther McVey, saying that Mrs Mayrsquos deal may be worse than remaining in the European Union, but theyrsquoll vote for it anyway. Though a hard core of Moggists will never submit.The Commons has also said that it doesnrsquot want a repeat referendum on Brexit ndash at least that was the overwhelming result of last weekrsquos Peoplersquos Vote amendment. I still havenrsquot heard a convincing argument for why most Remainers refused to vote for this proposal, even though it came from the Independent Group of Labour rebels. It will be hard, following Mr Bercowrsquos ruling on not putting repeat questions to the Commons, to find another direct way of proposing it next week.Instead, we have the Kyle Wilson amendment from two Labour MPs who want their party to vote for Mrs Mayrsquos deal on the condition that it is put to a ldquoconfirmation ballot of the people in a referendum. There are two problems with this. First, it means Labour actually voting for a deal that it has repeatedly said is an abomination, threat to jobs, undemocratic and so on and second, there is no guarantee that the referendum would come out the right way.:May could seek Brexit vote just  hours before EU departureI donrsquot see how a repeat referendum could exclude No Deal, since that is what many people thought they were voting for in . Labour might want its preferred option on the ballot too. This could leave us with a complex multi-option referendum, in which no one would win or lose convincingly. It would also mean the removal of Mrs May, since she has said repeatedly that she will never accept a referendum.It could come to that. Itrsquos an open secret that the Government whips have been suggesting to Brexit MPs thatthey back Mrs May next week they can also sack her at the same time. For many, this must be tempting. Yes, it would mean supporting a deal they loathe, but it would perhaps mean getting Boris Johnson into Downing Street. Incomprehensible though it may be, the former London Mayor is still extremely popular among the Tory membership. And hersquos recently cut his hair to show that he isnrsquot a wild child any more.Come to think of it, the prospect of Boris Johnson in No  might be the one thing that forces Labour and mainstream Tory MPs to unite in extremis behind Mrs Mayrsquos deal.

We are now engaging with the treasury on the issue of revenue support for the sector, and any support she can give to that would be very welcome. In the meantime, we have the prospect of the Energy White Paper coming up. Will she use her office to ensure that the potential for marine renewable energy generation is fully recognised when that white paper comes to publication #Responding on behalf of the government the energy minister, Claire Perry MP, said: “I don’t want to pre-empt the white paper, but one of the things we will show in that is how the ongoing attempts to be technology neutral to try and work across the piece to generate low cost, low carbon and highly competitive technologies will be part of that. We remain interested in marine and tidal as the Rt. Hon. Gentleman knows. Of course we need to discuss with the Treasury any support mechanisms, but I do want to continue to engage with the sector on a long term basis.#Speaking after the exchange, Mr Carmichael added: “White papers outline government’s thinking on policy areas, and are a key stage in influencing decisions made by ministers. Getting something in the white paper on support for the wave and tidal energy would be a huge coup for the industry which is big in the Northern Isles.“The marine energy industry is an innovative area of research, with the potential to add even more to our ability to export renewable energy to mainland Scotland. If the minister is committed to what she said about the policy now being ‘technology neutral’ then marine renewables should get a fair chance to be heard.“With a little more understanding and investment from central government, I believe we will soon reach a point where this industry can support itself, and provide stable, well paid and skilled jobs for many in Orkney and Shetland.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

If cattle react aggressively, release your dog and take the shortest, safest route out of the field.The Scottish Outdoor Access Code website provides more information, including online video tutorials covering everything from teaching a dog to be relaxed around livestock through to dog walker etiquette and legal responsibilities.Dog behaviourist and trainer Natalie Light said: “These videos are packed full of great tips that will give dog owners the information and skills to have fun and safe walks in Scotland’s outdoors as well as understand their rights and responsibilities under the Scottish Outdoor Access Code.“I hope they encourage everyone to get involved and have the confidence to enjoy getting out and about with their pets this spring.”Farmers and other land managers are also encouraged to support responsible access with dogs by following the guidance in the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, for example by avoiding putting sheep close to lambing in fields with well-used routes, or indicating reasonable alternatives. If necessary, local access officers can also provide advice.More information is available on the Scottish Outdoor Access Code website.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The leboat’s entire crew of eight lost their lives as they selflessly headed towards the cargo ship.The crew lost were: coxswain Daniel Kirkpatrick, nd coxswain James Johnston, bowman Ray Kirkpatrick, mechanic Robert Johnston, assistant mechanic James Swanson, and crew Jack Kirkpatrick, Robert Johnston and Eric McFadyen.Longhope RNLI and Longhope Leboat Museum Trust have in recent months, been in the process of preparing for the commemorative events marking  years since the loss of the T.G.B. and her gallant crew.Those events will take place both on land and at sea today, including at the Longhope Leboat Museum, the former leboat shed in Brims, where Longhope leboats were based for many years, before being based at Longhope Pier.Commemorations will also take place in front of the Longhope Leboat Memorial at Osmundwall, and at the YM Hall, Longhope.It is planned that a flotilla of boats, including RNLI leboats from Thurso, Stromness, Wick, and the current Longhope Leboat, plus the Coastguard tug Ievoli Black, an Orkney Harbours tug, pilot boat, and vintage leboat from Ireland, will congregate in Aith Hope, to lower their flags as a mark of respect. The Coastguard will also be represented by one of their rescue helicopters.Flags at leboat stations around Scotland, the RNLI’s Divisional Base in Perth, and at the RNLI’s HQ in Poole will be lowered to half mast.Coverage will appear online on The Orcadian Facebook page today, and in a special supplement in The Orcadian, out on Thursday.Local company Cloudnet IT Solutions also plan to livestream aspects of the events live at: https:livestream accounts  TGBLonghope vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

He set out that, between -, tourism numbers have increased by an impressive  per cent to almost , people with an estimated value of nearly £m.Mr McArthur warned that this success could not be taken for granted and presented its own challenges. As well as urging ministers to resolve the stand-off over RET and provide support for the replacement Orkney’s ageing internal ferry fleet, the Orkney MSP also repeated his call for Orkney’s world-class heritage sites to be backed by world-class infrastructure.Speaking after the debate, he said: #Tourism is one of the few sectors that touches almost every part of the country and it is one where Orkney has been punching above its weight over recent years.#With the natural assets we have and a lot of hard work by those involved in all aspects of the tourism sector locally, Orkney has seen visitor numbers and income increase signicantly over recent years. This success has brought awards and recognition, but it also brings with it challenges.#Everyone knows that Orkney’s reputation for quality requires the tourist experience to be managed carefully. This will involve taking pressure off key sites as well as making more of what Orkney has to offer.#It also needs Scottish Government to step up to the plate, not least when it comes to transport links. The long-overdue introduction of RET would help Orkney remain competitive as a destination, while replacement of the ageing internal ferry fleet is not only vital for the islands they serve but a means of encouraging visitors to explore more widely once they get here.“Ministers also have a role to play, through Historic Environment Scotland, in helping ensure that Orkney’s world-class heritage sites are supported by high-quality infrastructure. Local partners, including Destination Orkney and the Council, must be closely involved but investment through HES is crucial to making this happen.“There is good reason to believe that Orkney can continue playing to its strengths when it comes to tourism and there will be plenty of opportunities over the years ahead showcase our islands.  However, we cannot be complacent about what it will take to maintain and enhance Orkney’s reputation for good quality”.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

With this in mind, for his safety and well-being, we have strongly urged Mr Guidi to stop his extreme personal protests.“Separately, Mr Guidi has previously raised complaints with the bank.

On top of a six-euro nightly tourist tax, the city is now considering imposing an entrance fee of up to ten eurosduring peak periods.Edinburgh has not reached that point yet, but it is clear many people are unhappy about the current situation, amid fears that it will become a ‘doughnut’ city with a Disneyland theme park version of itself in the centre, surrounded by the real city where people actually live. That said, tourism is a major part of the economy of Edinburgh and Scotland as a whole. There are plenty of places around the world which would love to be as popular. If we were to discourage visitors – and some would say complaining about their presence may already be starting to do that – we would almost certainly regret our actions when they take their business where.: Tourism ‘tearing up fabric’ of Edinburgh, warns Val McDermidThe trick is to remain as welcoming as ever, while finding ways to alleviate problems for locals. The partial closure of Edinburgh’s Royal Mile to traffic created a venue for performers during the Festival Fringe, but it has clearly become too congested. Expanding events to other locations such as Leith would help spread out tourists, making the experience more enjoyable for them and less of a hassle for people trying to get on with everyday le. Similarly, there is a need for greater help for tourists to enable them to discover quieter parts of the country, such as the Borders and Dumfries  Galloway, as Irvine suggests. Skye is a beautul island, but it’s not the only one – Scotland has dozens to discover. Better planning seems key.We do need to be alive to both the economic benefits and the problems that can be caused by tourism. But we also should not simply look at this as a matter of pounds and pence. It is sometimes forgotten that the provision of hospitality is an age-old duty. Providing a welcome to people visiting what is to them a foreign land is the right thing to do.

I value all public sector workers and I thank them for the work that they do.“On the police pay award - that is the best award for police officers anywhere in the UK and the Scottish Police Federation said it was the best award in  years.”She added: “If the member thinks . per cent is not good enough... then I wonder what he makes of the two per cent that has been awarded to police officers in England by his Tory colleagues in the Westminster government, I think described by the head of the Met as a punch in the nose for police officers ”Later, Mr Simpson said the First Minister should apologise for her remarks in Holyrood.He said: “Nicola Sturgeon should be taking the concerns of a serving police officer extremely seriously. Instead, in front of Scotland’s parliament, she branded him a disgrace.“It’s no wonder officers are losing faith in this SNP government with that kind of attitude. These brave and hardworking police officers should not be discriminated against because they don’t threaten to go on strike.“The First Minister needs to apologise for being so dismissive of his concerns.”In the letter, the anonymous officer said: “Why has such a massive importance been placed on the pay rise for school teachers when other public service staff are not being awarded nearly as much as a pay rise “Does the Scottish Government place the value of police officers as only half that of school teachers  Is it that the Government know that because police officers cannot strike or take any real industrial action that they are an easy target ”A spokesman for the First Minister later said that she would not apologise as her \"disgraceful\" comment was not directed at the police officer but at Graham Simpson.During First Ministers Questions, Mr Simpson was booed by SNP backbenchers as he read out the letter, and asked what Nicola Sturgeon would say to the officer and “thousands of others” like him.Ms Sturgeon went on to say: “In terms of our NHS workers many get higher pay in Scotland than they do in England because of the value we attach to the work that they do.“In terms of teachers they have now been offered an exceptionally good pay deal and I think that is recognition of the good work that they do and I hope that is now accepted.“But I value all public sector workers and I thinkyou look at any group of public sector workers you will find that the value attached to them by the Scottish Government is much much greater than the value attached to their counterparts in England by the Tory government at Westminster.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"royal mile treasure trove of mary queen of scots documents found","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...A treasure trove of documents signed by Mary Queen of Scots and revealing the #everyday reality of ruling the country# in the th century has been unearthed in a council storage facility on the Royal Mile.A haul of handwritten papers is said to show the doomed monarch “carefully managing the busy commercial le of Edinburgh”, as well as authorising the building of new defences for the city in Leith.The documents, which are set to be the centrepiece of a new exhibition in Edinburgh on Mary’s short-lived rule, have already been conserved and digitised to allow them to be viewed publicly on the council’s online archive. They were discovered by staff in a store at the Museum of Edinburgh, just a few hundred yards away from the Palace of Holyroodhouse, where Mary ruled for six years after ing from France in .

But we hope to have them assessed by a conservator and for further research to be done on them by experts on Mary, after which we hope to exhibit them, which will be hugely exciting.”Museums and galleries manager Frank Little said: “We’re constantly reviewing, caring for and researching our collections, and look forward to sharing more of the city’s rich heritage with residents and visitors through our programme of exhibitions and online activities.” Council culture convener Donald Wilson said: “Our museums and galleries hold thousands of historic treasures, many of which are on display in our venues.

They then went on to highlight some of the key tenets underpinning the debate such as trade agreements, law and immigration, before making their concluding statements.In the opening gambit for the pro-Brexit team, S pupil Abbi Morgan argued that leaving the EU #would be a hugely positive thing for the UK# and would allow the country to #take control of borders and create worldwide trade agreements#.She went on to add that it would put the UK in a position to #take back its sovereignty# and make its own decisions on important matters. She stated that as a net contributor to the EU, the UK would be better off by £. billion.In the opening address for the pro-EU team, Lois Langlandssaid that #history and past experience as a member of the EU# gave the UK a more secure position for the future and that, in leaving the European Union, the UK would #enter the unknown# and #walk into the future blindfolded#.She said that outside the EU the UK was a #small fish in a big pond# and asked why any country would be interested in providing a free trade agreement with the UK.#The EU as an organisation is extremely wasteful#, he said. #Every  days the European Parliament moves from Brussels to Strasbourg, where it sits for four days # this is estimated to cost nearly £ million a year.#Touching on the issues of freedom of movement as part of the remain team, Chiara MacLeansaid: #Once the UK leaves the EU, British citizens will become third-party nationals, with no automatic right of admission.# She added that, through the new European travel information and authorisation system, all UK nationals over  years of age #would have to pay money to go somewhere they had a free right to go now#.Seth Bennettook up the reins for the pro-Brexit side, arguing that in terms of laws and immigration the EU could pass any laws they wanted and in by doing so #strip Britain of its sovereignty# # which he described as #one of its driving forces#.He believed that Brexit would offer the UK the chance to #increase its spending in education and housing# which could perhaps lead to a #revival of the nation#s once-thriving industries#.Speaking for the pro-EU team, Gracie Buchan said that leaving the European Union would lead to a trade deficit and result in a shortage of daily supplies such as fruit and vegetables.#Keeping food shop shelves full and prices down will be one of the biggest challenges when Brexit comes around,# she said. #Failure to reach some sort of an agreement could see retailers face an average increase of  per cent, particularly in dairy, meat, veg, and fruit.#Closing for the Brexit side, S pupil Joseph Moller said the EU favoured its own agenda and that in terms of per head of population Maltese citizens had  times more representation than UK nationals.He added that, rather than the , jobs that were cited as potentially being lost due to Brexit, the level of employment had in fact risen by one per cent since the referendum and unemployment was at its lowest level since the s.Summing up for remain, S pupil Innes MacNeil said: #Latest reports suggest that deals have been struck with just seven out of  countries, we have gained a lot more than we have spent on the EU, and multinational companies are threatening to relocate overseas, affecting jobs and investments.#Exiting in less than  days# time without any sound withdrawal agreement and just a few trade relationships will result in uncertainty and chaos.#The judges said they were impressed by how confident and informed the pupils were. They also felt the pupils were cohesive as a team and said that they saw some future MSPs and MPs.In the end, the judges awarded the team speaking against Brexit  points while the side advocating Brexit received  to claim victory.Skye, Lochaber, and Badenoch MSP Kate Forbes and Highland and Islands MSP Edward Mountain both fielded questions on Brexit after the debate and were quick to praise the pupils for their efforts.Ms Forbes said: #I certainly think they could have resolved Brexit faster than some of the politicians today # an absolutely fantastic debate based on fact, evidence, respect for each other, lots of confidence. I think I have left with a few top tips for my next debate in parliament!#Mr Mountain added: #I thought it was quite excellent # there#s obviously a lot of research gone into it. I thought they were extremely confident # I would have been much more nervous than that speaking at their age. As I said to Kate Forbes today, she should be worried because there are a few challenges for her position.#"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1659955.jpg--.jpg?1552468978000\n","title":"psni hosts christian groups","story":"A gathering of Christian outreach groups was hosted by the Mid and East Antrim police at Ballymena’s PSNI station on Tuesday, March  to discuss the possibilities for improved collaboration and communication, and to launch a new signposting initiative.Around  iniduals representing  dferent outreach ministries in Ballymena met with the local Neighbourhood policing team.Groups attending included foodbanks, debt-advice, anti-trafficking, sports coaching for youth, senior citizens support, mother and toddler, and English Language classes, amongst others.The event focused on the possibilities for greater collaboration between the churches, ministries, and the PSNI to improve cohesion, communication, and to explore ways in which we can work together to bring help and support of ious kinds to those needing it in our community.The event was facilitated by Without Walls in conjunction with Chief Inspector Stephen Humphrieswho hosted the event.

It was also during that time that he became involved in the Belfast History Project.Throughout his career, Joe has written, and published, books, magazines and newspaper articles for a range of media outlets during his career but, unlike some historians, his expertise grew outside the confines of traditional academia.By his own admission, he didn’t do too well at school, often “forgetting” to get off the bus at the gate. However, after ing to education at the Belfast College of Business Studies in the late s, he enrolled in history classes, which he would go on to utilise with the fledgling Belfast History Project.“I came back from college and started to get people involved in learning about the history of the area,” he explained.“From that, we discussed a number of dferent ideas. One idea we had worked on before that was cleaning up Clton Street Cemetery – which was where we used to drink our cider. It was all overgrown and wrecked at the time, but we all got together to fix it up. We tied in with people like Enterprise Ulster, and then Belfast City Council took it over and a number of volunteers came on board. Through that we developed this interest in local history.“Once the ball started rolling that was it. We started doing dferent educational projects. One of the things we started to discuss was putting a magazine together, which sounds very easy, but at that time there was this new thing coming out called a computer that you had to learn to use. Then you had to learn the computer programmes, which in those days was Pagemaker. Then you had to learn about printing and all the rest of it. Once we go up and running everything just fell into place.”The Belfast History Project has been exemplary in its endeavours, setting up groundbreaking publications and establishing history tours in long-unexplored areas of the city.“One of the good things is that when you look in Belfast city centre now and you see all the tours done here and there – blue badge this, white badge that – we get to look at it and say we did it first,” said Joe with a smile.“We did a walking tour in the Half Bap area and one of the very first tours was cancelled because of a bomb scare – not many tour operators can claim that.”The end of the conflict has ushered in a new age of competition as ious operators compete to sell tours of the ever-developing city of Belfast. While Joe believes the growing interest in local history is “brilliant” he insists branding and profits have often got in the way of fact.“People are trying to put these brands on things,” he said.“At my last count Belfast has nine-quarters. When I was at school,I was asked how many quarters there were andI had said nine I know what would’ve happened.“There is a lot of  stuff like this Tribeca development, which is a lot of nonsense.“They should do the names to reflect the history of the area. It annoys me when people try to put a  history on an area or say things that just aren’t true. We’ve always argued thatyou’re going to do history you should tell the truth. I love to see the tourism industry grow and change, but as long as they stick to a principle of truth.”Having started as a small local initiative, the Belfast History Project has flourished over the years, and now provides tours all over Europe, with their Russian tours booked up for nearly two years in advance. However, with all of its wider triumphs, the Belfast History Project remains a social enterprise, whose key aim is to give back to the community. Local tours and events still run regularly, such as the highly successful historical photographic exhibiton, which recently appeared in the New Lodge – and, as Joe explained, “It’s all about education”.“If we get people into history we can get them into education and guide them along their own path,” he said.“For example, we had a group of kids studying the history of the New Lodge, which grew to Belfast, Ireland and then Europe. They might be kids at the time, and they’ll mess about, but about tenyears later they’ll come back to us and say ‘That was the best project I was ever part of’ and that gives us a buzz.”Joe continued: “I remember years ago that the Barrack area in the New Lodge was just called the Barrack, but younger people didn’t know why it was called that. If you ask them now they’ll tell you it’s because there used to be an army barracks there.“Whenever you do a photographic exhibition and people are learning about their own area, then that’s the start of an educational journey.“As we always say, there is no more fruitful form of education than to raise the interest of people in their own surroundings.“Once you do that it can open up countless other opportunities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast twelfth parade rerouted due to primark works","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She had tea on her th birthday.\"This was a rare occasion when she was having a few drinks. Its not her scene. Shes never been one for going out. She was very much a family girl.\"Rachel added: \"I honestly dont know what happened. I dont think the gardai know either ... and I dont think it would be fair on Ruth to speculate.\"But now, after the terrible tragedy that unfolded during Ruths friends hen, instead of looking forward to her beloved sisters wedding, Rachel finds herself preparing for her funeral this weekend.It will leave her mothers residence in Ligoniel Place, Belfast on Saturday at .am to arrive at St Vincent de Paul Church for am Requiem Mass, then on to Carnmoney Cemetery for committal at am.\"She was getting married on August . Everything was ready she was very organised,\" Rachel said. \"I was going to be maid of honour. All the children - hers, mine and Ryans little girl Nyla- were going to be flower boys and girls. There were  guests.\"She added: \"We are going to let her wear her wedding dress in the coffin.\"Through tears, Rachel said Ruth was \"very family-focused, bubbly, funny, and level-headed\", adding that \"even though she was the baby of the family she was the sensible one of the four of us\".\"She was very determined and even with three kids she was always studying and trying to progress in work,\" she said. \"She was inspirational because she was such a brilliant mum.\"Were a very close family but her and I were particularly close, especially with the children. The cousins did a lot together. We were best friends and sisters. We talked every day.\"Rachel said its \"so dficult not understanding why she went across to the water\".\"The coming months were going to be so exciting ...

The outcome is likely to be announced by Council president Donald Tusk and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in a joint press conference before Mrs May joins the other leaders for dinner.Mr Tusk has indicated the EU could agree an extension in principle, subject to Mrs May getting her Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament next week. Their agreement must be unanimous.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Donald Tusk said the offer of an extension may be conditional on MPs agreeing Mrs May’s deal If they do not offer an extension, the legal default is that the UK leaves on March  with or without a deal.

Having such high-tech equipment available locally would mean many people from the area would not have to travel long distances to have their tests carried out where, Mr McGrath continued.ldquoSuch a scan can be a worrying time and the fact that people have to travel to other places for the scan adds to the anxiety.Cllr Trainor said a mobile scanner currently in place at the Downe to ease pressure at the Ulster Hospital will only be there for a few more weeks.ldquoDoes this fact not make the business case for the local health trust, too many people using the current scanner at the Ulster so one is required at the Downe  he asked.ldquoI hope local health officials will hurry up with their administrative work required to progress the business case to provide an MRI scanner in Downpatrick..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"City deals could bring finanacial boost for Newcastle  ","story":"PLANS to deliver a signicant multi-million pound tourism bonanza in Newcastle have taken an important step forward this week.Highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort are among the key projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector which have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.On Monday, members of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee agreed to sign a heads of agreement deal which paves the way for work to start on outline business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal which includes the Mournes Gateway project.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case and financial plans could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.And while the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The Newcastle tourism project was a key part of the city deal which has secured a near poundbn investment package from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Newry, Mourne and Down is hoping to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.And while talks continue to secure cash under the city deal initiative, local council officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for its other aspects and move the ious projects through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The tourism schemersquos other proposals include an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, a new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Consultants appointed by the local authority to look at developing the resortrsquos visitor infrastructure have also come up with proposals for the Islands Park, with upgrades planned for existing car parks, alongside new public toilet provision. There are also proposals to reduce the the tree line in Donard Forest on the slopes of the Mournes.A so-called lsquogreen travel networkrsquo which would allow visitors to hire bicycles and electric bikes to make their way round ious attractions is also suggested.The ious proposals form the core of the so-called Mourne Mountains Gateway Study and have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency.Before anything happens, numerous planning and environmental approvals will be required, alongside the compilation of feasibility studies and business cases.The overarching vision of the gateway project is to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions which develop sustainable enhancement of access from Newcastle to the Mournes and its foothills and forests, while also broadening recreational provision..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Coney Island singer Jayne looking for support to produce new album  ","story":"FROM Coney Island, to Nashville and on to Vancouver, musician Jayne Trimble has travelled many miles to get to where she is today.The folk musician is heading to Los Angeles next month to record her third album mdash that isshe can raise at least , Canadian dollars mdash thatrsquos pound, mdash to cover initial production costs.The former Down High student is asking local people, and women in particular, to support her Kickstarter campaign to record the album Your Mother Was A Peacock.While Jaynersquos vocals are hauntingly soft, she describes her latest music as ldquovisceral and epic.She is recording the new album, which will be produced by Damien Jurado, under the name Oxlip mdash which is an Irish wildflower.ldquoItrsquos my most ambitious and exciting album to date, explained the  year-old. ldquoItrsquos a collection of songs based on the lives of women throughout history who have either been scapegoated, or were just plain tragic.

There is also concern about the surface of the existing car park which is particularly uneven and the absence of adequate parking for visitors with young families.The access from the car park to the beach for families pushing prams is described as ldquounsuitable with the financial spend approved at Mondayrsquos meeting designed to improve the overall visitor experience, create a better first impression, improve the car park surface and the number of available spaces.New directional signs are also proposed, with council officials warning failure to address the issues could result in the loss of blue flag status, result in a negative visitor experience, reduced visitor numbers and income.To progress the improvement work, council officials have agreed to appoint a contractor to design a scheme.The planned investment has been welcomed by Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran.He said he was pleased local authority officials have recognise the need to improve Tyrella to ensure it continues to attract a high number of visitors, particularly from April and September.ldquoTyrella is an extremely popular beach, he said. ldquoIt is highly regarded as one of Northern Irelandrsquos top beaches and it is vital it retains its blue flag status. We rely heavily upon tourism in our area and we need to ensure our beaches are up to standard.Cllr Curran says he has no doubt that investing in Tyrella is not only ldquogood news for the district and visitors to the area, but will produce an economic idend through increased use.He continued: ldquoWe are fortunate to have stunning beaches like Tyrella, Kilclief and Ballyhornan on our doorstep. Those who work to keep our bathing waters clean and, more importantly, up to an internationally recognised standard so they are safe to use, do a terric job.Cllr Curran said picturesque beaches helped make up the ldquounique fabric of Lecale and the surrounding area and were a vital tourism resource.He added: ldquoThe planned investment at Tyrella is a good news story and I am pleased that the local authority is not content to sit back on its laurels but recognises the importance of continuing investment in a wealth of tourism assets right across the entire district.ldquoDown District is lucky to be blessed with such priceless resources which can make a valuable contribution to the health and well-being of our local communities and visitors alike. It is essential that we continue to strive for the very highest of standards across all our facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Derry Girls fun in Ballyhornan  ","story":"THE hit comedy series Derry Girls is putting Ballyhornan on the map.The Wee Shop in the small coastal village will be featured in one of the upcoming storylines of the much-anticipated second series.Viewers will see Game of Thrones actor Ian McElhinney and comedian Tommy Tiernan as Granda Joe and Da Gerry go off on some undisclosed caper in Burt, Co Donegal.Part of the newsagentrsquos shop and cafe was transformed into a grungy taxi office for two days of filming which took place at the end of last October.The Cable Bar, which is just feet away from the shop, is also featured in the scene.With old petrol pumps outside the shop, vintage tractors and an ice-cone sign, the Wee Shop looked authentic for the filming and should spark nostalgia for viewers of Donegal holidays for years past.The five young teens which star in the surprise Netflix hit set in s Derry mdash actors Saoirse-Monica Jackson, Nicola Coughlan, Jamie-Lee OrsquoDonnell, Dylan Llewellyn and Louisa Harland mdash were not involved in the filming.Channel rsquos Derry Girls, written by Lisa McGee, attracted an average two million audience per episode for its first series last year.

They came in and created a stud wall and painted the walls brown on the bottom and cream on the top and then distressed it to make it look as it had years of smoke on it.ldquoWith the ious props and bits and pieces, it really looked the part, he added.Brendan revealed that it was pure fate that led to the producers to ask to film there.He also insisted that the programme retained the shoprsquos name.ldquoA couple of guys were just out and about scouting around and thought that my shop was just what they were after for that scene, he explained.ldquoWhen they came in to discuss the matter, it turned out that one of the worked for me when I was a bar manager years ago up north.ldquoThey reimbursed me for two days of business and I felt that was fine because Irsquom hoping that there may be a spin-off for me with new customers once the programme airs.bull Episode three of Derry Girls airs on Tuesday at .pm on Channel ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Designer meets with Duchess again during Empire Bar visit  ","story":"SAINTFIELD fashion designer Meabh Mageean has the ear mdash and the eye mdash of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.The  year-old was lucky to meet the Duchess for the second time when she visited Belfast with her husband recently.It was natural that their chat turned to weddings and clothes, given that one is regarded as the best-dressed Royal in the world and the other is an up and coming fashion designer.Meabh had been asked to meet the Duchess at an celebration of achievement of young people at the Empire bar.She had previously met with her last February at a fashion event in Buckhingham Palace.ldquoI was asked to meet and talk to the Duchess about that event and my own work, explained Meabh.ldquoShe was interested to know what I brought back from last yearrsquos event andit enhanced my business.

No one thought this was going to happen.Mrs Trainor believes the Downe is capable of accommodating both ENT day surgery and the proposed cataract service, given that it is relatively modern hospital, boasting a range of high tech, diagnostic equipment and theatres.She added: ldquoIt simply beggars belief that we are to lose a key day surgery for people with ear, nose and throat problems. The loss is compounded by the fact that local hospital campaigners were not informed this was happening or asked for their views.Last week, a South Eastern Trust spokeswoman confirmed there were no plans to reduce the number of ENT sessions delivered at the Downpatrick hospital.She added: ldquoThe Trust is planning to increase ENT clinics at the Downe and to relocate an ENT day surgery session from Downpatrick to the Lagan Valley Hospital to facilitate the cataract elective care centre prototype work..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Farmers opposed to geopark plans  ","story":"PLANS to secure world renowned tourism branding for an area stretching from Strangford Lough to South Armagh have been dealt a major blow this week.As Newry, Mourne and Down Council prepares to submit a bid to secure prestigious UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union has labelled the proposal a ldquonon starter.Consultants have been working on the councilrsquos bid for geopark status ahead of a formal application being made this November.Supporters of the ambitious plan insist that securing geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.Geopark branding is one of the key planks of the local authorityrsquos tourism strategy with those involved in the process confident it has the potential to increase the number of international visitors to the area.However, the Ulster Farmersrsquo Union mdash whose representatives met recently with local authority officials and representatives from Geological Survey NI mdash says farmers are ldquounanimously opposed to the geopark.While it has been suggested that securing geopark branding could potentially be worth in the region of poundm for local tourism, the farmersrsquo union says it is ldquofar from impressed at the assertion that the designation will bring increased recreational opportunities and promote social inclusion.UFU deputy president Victor Chestnutt said farmers in the Newry, Mourne and Down area were were ldquofar from impressed with promises made by officials they met recently.The UFU official continued: ldquoI would like to remind these officials that farmers have been the custodians of the land for hundreds of years. Imposing a designation on this area will affect their livelihoods which will have a knock-on effect on all ratepayers in the area.ldquoCouncil officials believe and are promoting that this designation will not restrict the operations of any farmer. This is unrealistic and their approach is disappointing.ldquoWe are % opposed to these plans and I would urge the council to meet our members, listen to their concerns and reconsider their plans to progress with such an application.Mr Chestnutt is encouraging local authority officials to provide figures to UFU members to support claims that geopark branding will help grow farm businesses, confirming that until farmers see the figures in black and white, they will continue to dispute any such claims.The UFU vice-president said with local government elections fastapproaching, the organisation believes the time is right to review any proposed geopark application.He continued: ldquoThe UFU has made contact with each of the parties and all independent councillors who currently hold seats on Newry, Mourne and Down Council and it is disappointing that only a very small number have taken the time to listen and engage with us. We have many members residing and working in the area and some councillors have missed a genuine opportunity to engage with their constituents.The senior union official said the ldquostigma around the Mournes national park debate a number of years ago is still very much at the forefront of farmersrsquo minds, explaining that at the time, UFU members were united in their opposition to the proposals.Mr Chestnutt said the UFU believed that farmers who live and work in the area should decide whether or not an area is suitable for national park or global geopark status.He said the council had put nothing on the table to reassure members and encourage them to reverse their position.With tourism one of the key drivers behind the geopark branding, Mr Chestnutt said Tourism NI was ldquovisibly absent from any discussions.He said farmers believed tourism in the area could be developed without the need to introduce a special designation.ldquoThe funding and resources the council has earmarked for the development and operation of the proposed new geopark should be redirected to the general promotion of tourism and infrastructure development. We are in favour of economic development but securing geopark status is not the way to do it, he declared.Mr Chestnutt added: ldquoOur message is simple and direct ndash farmers in the area are strongly opposed to the geopark proposal and I would urge all councillors, council officials and the Geological Survey of NI to fully and meaningfully engage with us.ldquoThe best course of action would be to rethink the geopark proposal and focus tourism investment into wider promotion of our beautul countryside.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council said the geopark had the potential to make a ldquosignicant contribution to local communities and tourism in the Mourne, Ring of Gullion and Strangford and Lecale areas.ldquoIt is important to understand that a geopark is not a legislative designation and will therefore not place any restrictions on economic activity within the proposed areas, including on any farming practices, he said.ldquoThe introduction of a geopark will not introduce additional planning restrictions and instead will simply provide an globally recognised accreditation.ldquoThe geopark will only include sites which already have public access and the geopark will not promote any access to private land, unless the landowner in question wants to work with the geopark.The spokesman added: ldquoThe process to achieve geopark designation is ongoing and it is not until  that an accreditation would be confirmed as part of this ongoing process.ldquoIn the meantime, the council will continue to deliver events and activities to increase awareness of what the project represents and how it can grow our tourism offering and support our local communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C March 13%2C 1979  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash THE Earl of Clanwilliamrsquos th century mansion and -acre estate at Montalto, Ballynahinch, officially goes on sale today.

Almost immediately the perfect skull complete with teeth was removed to prevent damage and a process of dating the skeleton began.The farmer wishes to keep his identity and the location of the field unknown in an effort to prevent vandalism and damage to nearby fields which have been planted with early potatoes.This was the first time that the field had been ploughed in recent years and this, combined with the severe frosts and natural erosion, contributed to the moving of the skeleton closer to the surface.The site of the finding is referred to a history of Killyleagh written in  which states that human bones had been found in the area before and that there were others known to lie there.According to the history the tradition is that they are the bones of Protestants who during the rebellion of  were chased by the native Irish and were massacred.BALLYGOWAN mdash Five year-old Tara Rhodes, who has several relatives in Ballygowan, has flown to America with her father in a frantic bid for emergency treatment.Tara, who has a brain tumour which has already left her blind mdash is preparing to undergo treatment which will cost about pound,.The money has been collected through a special fund which was set up last November by Tararsquos mother, Sara, who was told by doctors that her daughter had only six months to live.Despite the claims of medical experts, Tararsquoa anguished parents launched a UK-wide appeal campaign, which included a special charity dance in Ballygowan.DRUMAGHLIS mdash Plans to shut down Drumaghlis Primary School, near Crossgar, have been ditched by the Department of Education.The small country school, which is  years old and caters for  children, has escaped the threat of closure and is expected to undergo a modernisation programme soon.Earlier this year the Department suggested that the school should be closed, but pressure from the schoolrsquos management committee has led to a reversal of plans.The Department thought that it may be better to close the school because it lacked many facilities and was not up to modern day standard.The Rev Dr W D Bailie, chairman of the management committee, protested bitterly and called on the support of the South Eastern Education and Library Board.Dr Bailie said: ldquoWe are delighted that the Department has responded to our plea to permit the school to continue to cater for the educational needs of this area.CROSSGAR mdash Preparations are well under way for the big Easter fair to be held in Crossgar War Memorial Hall on April .

Parking around the Bridge Street and Mount Crescent area is limited, she remarked.ldquoWe do not encourage students to drive to school. When they do, students are advised through sixth-form year assemblies that there are residential homes in the area and due consideration needs to be given to that. We advise them that they should park with care and consideration and within the law and they are reminded not to park on the pavement.ldquoPupils who drive a car to school provide us with their car details. Should a complaint be left by a member of the public, we attempt to identy the driver and address the issue.Mrs Perry added that this was currently a ldquospike time of the school year for student drivers as it combined both pupils from its upper sixth year who have been driving for upwards of a year and lower sixth pupils who had recently passed their driving tests..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Posnett powers Saul to cosy win  ","story":"TEAM Saul claimed victory in the CosyRoof Winter League at St Patrickrsquos Golf Club.Saul were led by captain Phil Posnett and Donard, who they beat in the final, were headed by deputy captain captain Gerry Reilly.After poor weather on Saturday it was Saul that were quickest out of the blocks come Sunday morning with Phil and Ed Baggley snr both shooting  points.These scores were quickly followed by their team-mates Joe Deegan withand Lawrence Craig with  points.The champagne was now chilling nicely, particularly as the first two Donard scores from Gerry Reilly with  points and Bill Dunlop with  points, made no inroads into Saulrsquos  total.In the early afternoon the drama began to unfold as Joe OrsquoNeill shot an incredible  points to bring Donard within touching distance of the prize.

Bryansfordrsquos Chris Brannigan was the lsquogo torsquo man for vital scores and Carryduffrsquos Ronan Lawlor won a Colleges All-Star award that year.Previous wins in the competition came in ,  and  with the teams of lsquo and lsquo going on to win the All Ireland Collegesrsquo B final.Cathair Dhoire may not have the same sort of identity or history as the Red High, but they will still be a tough nut to crack.The Red Highrsquos campaign didnrsquot start that well and they lost their opening group game - to - when Our and Lady and St Patrickrsquos, Knock, edged past them by the narrowest of margins.They picked up a bit of momentum following a comprehensive - to - victory over St Patrickrsquos, Keady.This was followed up by a - to - win over St Louisrsquo, Ballymena, before a - to - extra-time victory against St Malachyrsquos, Castlewellan, in the quarter-finals.St Louisrsquo, Ballymena, were their semi-final opponents, but they were no match for the Red High flair and went down - to -.Meanwhile, Cathair Dhoire enjoyed wins over Our Ladyrsquos, Castleblaney, Our Ladyrsquos and St Patrickrsquos, Knock, and Inis Eoghan, Donegal, on their way to the final. In addition, the St Columbrsquos players in the squad were also involved with their schoolrsquos senior team that won this seasonrsquos Markey Cup.The Derry side are blessed with a plethora of talented players, none more so than Ben McCarron, a highly-rated forward who played for his county in this yearrsquos McKenna Cup.St Patrickrsquos will look to their defensive markers, Eoin Rooney and Jack Harbinson, while skipper Ronan Murphy, Ciaran Watson and Peter McMullan will hope to turn defence into attack.Murphy is really looking forward to the final and believes that his team-mates have all the hard yards done in training.ldquoWe are really looking forward to the final. This is one of the reasons we all play the game. It makes all the hard work and effort worthwhile, he said.ldquoPreparations are going well. I canrsquot fault the lads, everyone is putting in a sht and getting out to training. Hopefully, all the hard work will pay off.ldquoWe donrsquot really know much about Cathair Dhiore as all year we have just concentrated on our game and what we need to do. They obviously have good players to get this far with a few lads who have won Ulster Colleges All Star awards and played senior football for Derry, so, we know they are pretty decent.He continued: Getting to the final has created a real buzz and itrsquos infectious. Everyone in the school is looking forward to it. The school is covered in maroon and gold and itrsquos just class as it sends good vibes all around the place.ldquoFormer players and coaches have been wishing us well and it has been great to see them involved as the Red High has a huge history and tradition in Ulster Collegesrsquo football.St Patrickrsquos have potential match winners all over the park and in Tim Prenter mdash a regular starter in the countyrsquos senior hurling team mdash Ruairi OrsquoHare, Brandon Boyd, Tom Smyth and Niall Laverty they have players capable of winning games on their own.Red High coach Declan Morgan believes that his charges have what it takes to go all the way this year.ldquoWe have been training exceptionally hard, but the boys enjoy the work and there is a great camaraderie in the squad, he said.ldquoThere is pace and mobility all over the pitch and we have defenders that can negate Cathair Dhoirersquos scoring threat. Our lads all know the job they have to do. We have invested a lot in this squad and they have responded brilliantly.ldquoHowever, there is no guarantee in football and know we have a lot to do to get our hands on the cup, he added.ldquoWe havenrsquot mentioned the fact that we are already through to the All-Ireland Collegesrsquo B semi-finals, regardless of Mondayrsquos outcome, as amalgamated schools are unable to compete in that competition.ldquoThe boys are focused totally on winning on Monday and they will not be taking their eye off the ball.The final is still a long way off for several players who face a weekend of action in other sports.ldquoWe canrsquot wrap up the boys in cotton wool, but I will be on the phone on Saturday night to several of the players to ensure they havenrsquot picked up any injuries, Mr Morgan said.ldquoHowever, we have a  strong  and they have all bought into the team ethos and our horses for courses policy.ldquoThe lads are so looking forward to the final and are fully aware of the schoolrsquos history in the competition.He added: Itrsquos been a while since the MacLarnon Cup was in Downpatrick, but I am convinced this squad can bridge that gap and bring the trophy back to the Red High for the first time in  years..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"St Michael’s are champions  ","story":"ST Michaelrsquos wrapped up the - league title with two matches to spare when they overcame visiting St Patrickrsquos.

Those people talk of her apparent lack of remorse for joining Islamic State, which she did in  when she left her East London home as a -year-old and travelled to Syria. Others, including myself feel somewhat sympathetic towards her.I am abhorred by the views she holds but I donrsquot believe her decision to leave her home and her family and travel to Syria is a story without complexities. I see a vulnerable child who was radicalised by extremists while on British soil, in an area of East London I used to call home. I see a young teenager who was married to an IS fighter within two weeks of arriving in Syria and has been brainwashed perhaps beyond repair after witnessing levels of violence and destruction that most of us wouldnrsquot even be able to contemplate. But most tragic of all, I see a young mother who, at just  years of age, has lost three children in the space of four years. To me, thatrsquos an unimaginable level of trauma. And no, she doesnrsquot deserve it. No one deserves such pain.Irsquom not condoning her actions or her behaviour. She should face the legal consequences of her actions. She should be tried in a British court for the crimes she has allegedly committed. That is, after all, why we have the rule of law. But wiping our hands of her and failing to act to protect her son before he died of pneumonia in a grim refugee camp, shows just how much, as a country, the UK has lost its moral compass.Irsquove heard a number of commentators conflating her situation with that of the hundreds of innocent people whorsquove suffered at the hands of IS, particularly the vulnerable Yazidi women who were captured and are now being used as sex slaves. The dference, of course, is that they did not sign up to be a part of the caliphate, like Ms Begum. I am equally horried by the plight of these women and their children.But why do incidents such as this one always come back to whataboutery  Nothing was ever solved by this derailing and deflection technique. It is hypocritical to suggest we should have cared less about Ms Begumrsquos three-week-old baby than those captured or indeed killed by IS. Innocent people are innocent people and we should care equally about each and every one.Just because there are innocent victims still at the behest of ISIS does not negate the fact that the rights of a baby have been ignored and that child has now died, a death that couldrsquove been prevented by the Home Secretary, Savid Javid, had he chosen compassion and humanity over appeasement and pandering to rising populism.Indeed, Ms Begumrsquos case has highlighted a dilemma facing many countries in Europe, ided over whether to allow IS members or supporters to come home and face prosecution or block them. In the Republic, the Irish government may soon have to decide whether to intervene in the case of Lisa Smith, the Dundalk woman who travelled to Syria a number of years ago to join IS.She now has a two-year-old son and the pair are staying in the Al Hawl camp for the family members of Isis fighters.It is sadly too late for Ms Begumrsquos son. But there are countless other children in similar circumstances andnothing , this story should serve as a timely reminder that children are not to blame for their parentsrsquo actions.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

That being the case, this council, like many others in Wales, is unable to continue to provide the level of subsidy to outdoor sports provision that it has in the past.ldquoExploring dferent ways of working, including the transfer of responsibilities in appropriate circumstances to community groups is a key element of the councilrsquos strategy moving forward as it addresses dficult budget priorities.ldquoFollowing the successful transfer of responsibilities for five libraries to community-based organisations and looking at a number of successful sports clubs across the Vale of Glamorgan who operate without any subsidy from the Council, it is hoped that the majority of clubs currently using council facilities will be able to continue to provide opportunities for all to participate in sports activities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The event ran from Saturday March  to Tuesday March .The Vale brewery Tomos and Lilford produced a special beer called ldquoCarnival - Penarth Pale Ale.Meanwhile the two Penarth butchers, Thompson Family Butchers and David Lush Butchers, both created their own special Penarth carnival sausages.The organisers estimated that more than  people took part in costume in the walk through town on Saturday, which saw the coronation of the lsquoFirst Foolrsquo at am. The procession marched from Sully Terrace through town.At .am in Penarth Library, there was a presentation of the head of Bendigeidfran, from The Mabinogion. The head was made by children from Cogan and Penygarth schools.The lsquoFirst Foolrsquo was then sent by train to the Tower of London to bring news of the Carnival to the traditional resting place of the head of Bendigeidfran, where he met the Raven Master.Long distance cyclist Dave Hann was due to cycle to Harlech, north Wales to raise money for the RNLI Penarth, and bring news to Harlech that Carnival had broken out in Penarth.Unfortunately Mr Hann only got as far as Cardigan before Storm Freya made it too dangerous to continue. Organisers have one barrel of carnival ale left and will take it to Harlech by train in the next few weeks to share it and the storybook of the carnival.On Sunday, two rugby teams took part in a ldquotug-o-sausage to decide which butcherrsquos sausage was better. Congratulations were extended to the winners, Team Thompson.Congratulations were also extended to the traders Ener-chi and Lilypad by the organisers, for having the best-dressed shop windows. Particular praise was singled out for the carnival flowers at Holm House Hotel created by Lilypad.Further nights of partying, songs and dancing were spotted in the Albion, St Faganrsquos Castle, and other pubs, bars and venues across Penarth. There were also celebrations on the Penarth Pier on Tuesday night following a Pancake Day event, while wandering bands of musicians like Wonderbrass kept spirits high.The festival culminated in a grand Mardis Gras party on Tuesday, which saw crowds of costumed residents dance the night away.Richard Parry, one of the carnival organisers, said: ldquoToday is Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent. Carnival finished last night on Mardi Gras.ldquoThanks to everyone who took part, contributed, encouraged, sponsored, smiled and partied, especially those people who took a carnival Bank Holiday Monday.ldquoIt was fabulous to hear your Carnival Bank Holiday stories, and to all those people who have had little private carnival moments of joy over the festival, thatrsquos what it has all been about.ldquoAnd some people have already said, lsquosee you next year!rsquoldquoThere were lots of people laughing and smiling on the sidelines, telling me they wanted to take part next year ndash just with a little more notice next time. But now itrsquos established, wersquoll be back next year and ready for even more people to join in the fun! article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Wersquore creating work which is not really necessary.If we want to improve the gateway there are other ways of doing it.ldquoIt really doesnrsquot begin to tackle the active travel . I do feel this is about spending the money before next February.Councillors were told the widened roundabout was one part of a wider strategy for transport improvements in Penarth.Charlotte Pugh, senior planner for the council, said the new scheme would transform the area.She said: ldquoThis whole are is going to be completely transformed. At the moment it is not very welcoming to pedestrians.ldquoI think it will go some way to transforming this gateway into Penarth and make it a safer environment.Previous plans to make part of Plassey Street one-way to incoming traffic, and removing the roundabout altogether, were dropped following opposition from the public.The committee agreed to endorse the transport scheme but requested regular updates on the wider transport plans for Penarth. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This fantastic choir is run by The Aloud Charity, which is based here in the constituency, and is doing incredible work all around Wales, involving young people in music and teamwork and giving them the confidence to not only succeed in music but in their lives more generally.It was a real honour to host them in Parliament, where they sang for the Speaker, for MPs, and during the St Davidrsquos Day Service in the Chapel, before heading to the Public Gallery of the Commons to watch the St Davidrsquos Day debate.This annual debate is an important one for Wales, allowing MPs to talk about all sorts of issues. I spoke about transport and train services ndash a long running campaign of mine as you will know.I then spoke in the crucial debate on climate change. Believe it or not, itrsquos been far too long since wersquove had a debate on this issue in Parliament, and I spoke about the importance of our investments and pensions going into renewable sources, not into fossil fuels.I also pointed out my support for the young people across the UK who went on a climate strike the week before. Itrsquos their futures that wersquore concerned about here and they were absolutely right to do what they did.And then of course the Brexit shambles continues ndash we cannot escape it ndash but we were debating it again last week, with hugely important votes to come next week.But last week was a signicant one. The PM was forced into a corner, forced to concede that she might have to rule out No Deal and extend Article , and the Labour Party came out decisively for putting this issue back to the people.And this week we saw the Government attempt to win over MPs with a fund it claims will boost less well-off towns after Brexit ndash but in another shambolic aspect to this hapless attempt to bribe MPs into voting for Theresa Mayrsquos so-called deal, there is no cash for Welsh towns.Another example of the Tories letting Wales down, and yet further reason to support the push for a final say on Brexit for the public through a Peoplersquos Vote. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Last month I met with constituents over disruption to local rail services. I know that many of you will have experienced delays and cancellations to services in the weeks following the handover of the Wales Rail Franchise. I understand and share the frustration that these delays have caused. There has been a shortage of rolling stock as a result of a large maintenance backlog following the handover of the franchise together with planned changes to rail services. This has led to a signicant reduction in services and replacement bus services. I have been in contact with the Minister for Transport and Transport for Wales to raise the concerns of constituents. I have been assured that service levels are now back to normal and they do not anticipate any restrictions to services in the coming year. I will of course maintain my interest to see that those assurances are kept. I will update residents again on future plans to deliver improved station facilities, trains and more regular services.As many of you are aware Cardf Bus has recently announced changes to bus services across Cardf and the Vale. A number of bus routes are at risk as part of these changes. The removal of bus links for work, social links and public services, including hospital routes, would have a signicant impact on my constituents.Cardf Bus are not acting to deliberately hurt our communities. Far from being an uncaring organisation Cardf Bus are stuck with a legal framework that stops them from operating on the same basis as commercial competitors. Competitors can cherry pick and target single profitable routes that undermine the wider social propose that most of us want from local bus services. Cardf Councilrsquos Labour leadership has committed to supporting at risk bus services for  years. Unless the Conservative leadership of the Vale Council agrees to Labour councillors amendments to the budget and protects local bus services in the Vale then bus routes will go. The Vale Council leadership could and should act. If they donrsquot then my constituents will suffer.In future, the regulation of buses is the answer. London was the only part of the UK that was allowed to keep a regulated bus service. It is no mistake that it has the best and most coherent service. We now have the legislative powers to regulate bus services here in Wales. The Welsh Government is currently consulting on proposals to reform bus and taxi services in Wales. More information on the consultation can be found at: https:beta.gov.wales improving-public-transport.

He was animated and passionate, and had clearly forged a close bond with his teacher.The head of Westbourne Prep School, Joanne Chinnock, said: ldquoOur school is a happy place, and wersquove long held the philosophy happy children learn well.       ,params: .pushldquoOur lsquosecretrsquo is the very close bond between the children, from Nursery and Reception classes all the way to the top of the school and the staff, who know each child very well indeed.There are a huge number of after school clubs on offer. Children have the opportunity to learn a wide range of instruments, including the harp, trumpet, piano, violin, drums, guitar and organ.A large set of sports clubs stake full advantage of the the Welsh coast, with frequent use of Penarth Pier, the beach and natural beauty spot Cosmeston Lakes. Sports on offer include swimming, yoga, basketball, touch rugby, dodge ball, gymnastics, cross country, and football.There are even more opportunities to excel in other areas, with offerings including Young Journalists, Nature Club, Art Club, Chess and ldquoMad Science.Westbourne offers the InternationalDiploma Programme in sixth form and GCSEs and IGCSEs for its secondary pupils.Their IB average is - points, high enough to qualy for Oxford University, with two-thirds of all Higher Level grades being s and s, and two-thirds of students receiving a Bilingual Diploma.The GCSE results are equally impressive with  per cent of all grades being s and s per cent the new, harder, grade  and a further  per cent grade s.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The outcome is likely to be announced by Council president Donald Tusk and European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in a joint press conference before Mrs May joins the other leaders for dinner.Mr Tusk has indicated the EU could agree an extension in principle, subject to Mrs May getting her Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament next week.Their agreement must be unanimous.Donald Tusk said the offer of an extension may be conditional on MPs agreeing Mrs Mayrsquos deal If they do not offer an extension, the legal default is that the UK leaves on March  with or without a deal. Mrs May has already accepted that she no longer has time to complete the necessary legislation by that deadline, leaving her with the unenviable choice of revoking Article  to keep the UK in the EU or leaving without a legislated deal.Friday March Mrs May will remain in Brussels to discuss issues like climate change, jobs and the th anniversary of the European Economic Area. This will possibly be the final participation of a British prime minister in a summit as one of the  EU leaders.Saturday March -Sunday March Intensive talks are expected to continue with MPs ndash particularly Conservative Brexiteers and the Democratic Unionist Party ndash to try to shore up support for Mrs Mayrsquos Withdrawal Agreement.Saturday is expected to see large crowds attend a Put It To The People march and rally in central London demanding a second referendum.Organisers say that as many as , people took part in a Peoplersquos Vote march in London last October Monday March Under an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Act secured last year by Remain-backing MP Dominic Grieve, the Government must table an amendable motion in response to its second ldquomeaningful vote defeat last week. MPs are likely to use the opportunity to promote their own preferred options. These could range from a no-deal Brexit to a close Norway-style relationship with the EU, a longer postponement or a second referendum.Mrs Mayrsquos effective deputy David Lidington has also promised to kick-off a two-week process to seek a majority on the best way forward, which may involve indicative votes on alternative outcomes.Monday March -Friday March Mrs May is expected to put her Withdrawal Agreement package to a third ldquomeaningful vote in the Commons ndash assuming that Speaker John Bercow accepts that her motion is fundamentally dferent from those defeated by  votes in January and  in March.Theresa May announced she was seeking a three-month delay to Brexit at Prime Ministerrsquos Questions in the Commons She is also expected to push a statutory instrument through the Commons and the Lords to remove the exit date of March  from Brexit legislation, in a process which Downing Street expects to take one or two days.If the Agreement gets through at the third attempt, the European Council is likely to confirm the offer of an extension, allowing the UK to complete the process of ratying the treaty and getting legislation in place for an orderly exit in May or June.If the package is rejected for a third time, there will be intense pressure on the EU to nonetheless offer an extension to preserve the hope of a smooth Brexit.Thursday March Next Thursday has been mooted as a possible date for an extraordinary European Council summit to find a last-minute solutionno agreement has been reached.Friday March If no extension has been offered and no agreement approved by MPs, the UK will leave the EU without a deal at pm, with the potential for widespread disruption.Leave Means Leave marchers demanding a no-deal Brexit are due to arrive in London after a two-week walk from Sunderland.March -June If Mrs Mayrsquos plan has worked, this period will see the UK pass the necessary legislation for an orderly withdrawal from the EU. If Brussels has delivered an extension but Mrs Mayrsquos deal has been rejected by MPs, there will be furious debate in Westminster on the way forward.April Deadline for the UK to declare it is participating in the European Parliament elections.May -European Parliament elections. Brussels says that no further extension to Article  will be possiblethe UK has not taken part in the vote.June Under Mrs Mayrsquos plans, the UK would leave the European Union and enter an -month transition period lasting to December  , during which it would observe EU rules but have no representation in Brussels institutions.Intensive talks would take place in this period on the future trade and security relationship between the UK and EU, with the hope of finalising a deal before the end of ..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Brexit: What happens next  article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Over the years Goal Line has worked with young people who have had a wide range of disabilities including Autism, Asperger’s Syndrome, ADHD , Down’s Syndrome, developmental delays, speech and other problems.In order to benefit from the PHA CLEAR Grant, Goal Line opted for a number of self-initiatives based around art and creative therapies, and several physical activity programmes that tested the young people in the sports hall in a iety of activities and team challenges.The young people benefitted from, and thoroughly enjoyed, a wide range of activities which saw personal development and well-being very much to the fore.Youth Support Worker Maxine Chambers said: “For the young people, being able to work in a group and develop their confidence and then to be able to voice their opinions and their own interpretation of things has been fantastic through Jason’s workshops. Through Trevor’s ceramic flower work it was a chance for them to deal with sensory issues, overcome issues with messy clay and that sort of thing.“Some of them were afraid to get their hands dirty or put them into the clay but when they saw people doing it they knew that it was ok. And when it came to painting the flowers it was brilliant, they loved all that – the outcome was superb and they were delighted to see what actually came at the end of the project with the flowers forever, flowers for their parents and the parents were amazed that the children had made those.“The fitness sessions were great in getting them into the sports hall and getting them involved in activities that they may not have tried before or at all – the New Age curling and boccia were good examples and it was good to see them having great fun indoors in something they can all do.”The grant also enabled Goal Line to facilitate a talk about strategies for dealing with dficult behaviours in young people. The talk was given by Dr Kate Kirk, a psychodrama psychotherapist from the Isle of Man. It was well attended by family, principals of primary schools, teachers, Special Educational Needs Co-ordinators, social workers, doctors and youth workers.

aims to engage senior citizens in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough to become their own advocates, has been set up.Run by Richmount Rural Community Association it is hoped it will campaign for their needs to be listened to and to be addressed. The project not only addresses the voices of seniors in the Association’s own area but further afield as well. It also seeks to pool ideas for older people’s groups and share expertise and identy support for groups where assistance would be beneficial. At the launch elected representatives and statutory agencies welcomed the project.Chairman Joe Garvey said: “Everyone thinks they know what old age is like and what older people want and need but only one group of people who really knows and what matters to them is the older people themselves.“Some older people, mainly because of work experience, are able to have an impact and get their message across. “They may also have good access to information, contacts with decision makers and have experience of dealing with formal meetings, negotiating and working with large organisations. “But for most older people the picture is dferent. “They feel far removed from people in power and they do not feel well informed or confident enough to speak up when the ‘important’ peopleare talking about them.” This project is funded by Community Foundation for Northern Ireland . The project will focus on: Social Isolation and loneliness, engendering respect for older people, dealing with anti-social behaviour, health and GP services.Threat of legal action over SRC

The Department of the Economy’s Strategic Energy Framework, which was endorsed by the Executive in , has over the last nine years, led to some very positive changes to the energy generation and supply mix, particularly from renewable sources.However the  year framework is nearing its end and needs to be replaced. The Department is making such preparations as it can on a draft Strategic Energy Framework across the areas of heat, electricity, transport and energy efficiency which it aims to make public some time in the spring. Whether or not this region has its Assembly back to adopt such a framework will remain to be seen, but in the meantime it will ensure the subject remains live and high on the agenda.Brexit and I-SEMThe new wholesale electricity market known as the Integrated Single Electricity Marketwent live on October , . It is designed to deliver increased levels of competition which, it is hoped, will help put downward pressure on prices as well as encouraging greater levels of security of supply and transparency. While the island of Ireland is now integrated more closely with European markets, there is a risk that Brexit could halt this integration. British and Irish business groups and energy trade associations such as the CBI, IBEC, Electricity Association of Ireland, RenewableUK, British Irish Chamber of Commerce and EnergyUK all refer to the delivery of I-SEM, or to the UK’s continued access to the IEM, as post-Brexit priorities for security of supply and or consumer protection. I-SEM is clearly a priority that must be preserved.While Brexit may present challenges and continuing uncertainty, there are certainly opportunities for investment and acquisition in the electricity market as more complex, specialist expertise will be required to effectively trade power on the I-SEM. Policy barriers or inaction cannot be allowed to prevent I-SEM from realising its potential of fully integrating the market by efficiently moving energy from producer to demand.Renewable incentive schemesDespite being on track to hit its target of % of electricity generation from renewables, Northern Ireland risks being left behind. The lack of a replacement for the development support mechanism, Renewables Obligations Certicateafter its closure in April , means Northern Ireland is lagging behind Great Britain which has established the Contract for Dference regime and Ireland, which has started work on its Renewable Electricity Support Scheme . While neither scheme is perfect, doing nothing is not an option. The devolution of energy presented Northern Ireland with the opportunity to shape its own policy but without a government, will the sector and the infrastructure be able to remain fit for purpose GasWith its development over the last  years, the gas network in Northern Ireland, with its low population density, must be seen as a success story. Consumers and businesses have been offered greater choice in terms of price and security of supply. Nevertheless there are certainly further opportunities for gas distributors and suppliers to expand the natural gas network, particularly in the west of the country and east Co Down. So despite the apparent obstacles and challenges, there is opportunity for development and progress in Northern Ireland’s energy sector. The benefits for Northern Ireland will be in terms of security of supply, price and environmental sustainability. Cleaver Fulton Rankin,  Bedford Street, Belfast BT FW.

Since I took on the Northern Ireland role six years ago, we’ve doubled the workforce, become the fastest-growing UK region and are now the biggest office outside London with just over , people,” he says. “Our strategy was to be the leading provider of professional services in the Northern Ireland market but there’s no way we’d be the size we are now had we only focused on that.”Instead Paul built on the legacy of his predecessors and accelerated growth in new, technology solutions, while retaining the traditional accounting, tax and consulting services. Today PwC remains the leading provider of advisory services to the region’s family-owned and owner-managed businesses and multinationals, but has also built an impressive portfolio of cutting-edge technologies, opened the door to signicant export markets and is tackling some of society’s most challenging issues. “We’ve grown in many new areas – blockchain, cyber, cloud-based accounting services – but the single biggest impact has come from developing our distinctive ‘Operate’ ision,” Paul says. ”Operate is our service delivery business, which supports and delivers technology and people solutions to large, often regulated organisations. So instead of just advising clients how to solve their problems, we now do the heavy lting for them.”Run by Ian McConnell, a partner who’s been with the firm for  years, Operate is already attracting global attention. “Clients increasingly don’t want a consulting firm just to tell them what to do: they want a problem-solving partnership.” he says. “In its first year of operation, Operate earned over £m, now has , people and is still growing.”Reinforcing Paul’s confidence to invest in Northern Ireland as a strategic location is a  forecast from TheCityUK that it could become the second fastest-growing financial services region outside London by , helping deliver £bn of additional gross value-addedto the UK economy. But that depends on the ability to recruit the right talent, and he says the challenge now is finding and retaining the skills.That’s an issue that particularly concerns Paul as he looks ahead at the economic picture with Brexit and lack of an Assembly to the fore.“The business community wants clarity and certainty. Ideally we want to see a Brexit withdrawal agreement that then gives the scope for a trade deal that offers Northern Ireland the capacity to trade both with the EU and as part of the UK. The potential competitive advantages and ability to attract investment would be terric and the kind of economic accelerator which we have sought for years, but never managed to gain.“However I do worry about the impact of political stalemate on our long term future. Failure to invest, particularly in education and skills, will impair our competitiveness and make this a less attractive place for business.The decreasing effectiveness of health, environment and infrastructure will mean that talented people will opt to make choices to live their lives where.“In my national role, I see other parts of the country fusing partnerships in innovative and exciting ways between business,education and government. Compared to that, we are already getting left behind. We should be moving forward.”Which brings us to Merchant Square, the £m, , sq ft office development which PwC takes over in . “We have great people and one reason why we’re moving to the city centre is because that’s where they want to be. By the time we’re ready to relocate towards the end of , we will have at least , people moving in to the heart of Belfast.“That makes it important for Belfast too and not just because it’s the city’s biggest-ever private sector office deal. As we were making our decision, the whole Bank Buildings issue was at its height, and we wanted to show our support for the city and its future.” The Merchant Square relocation project is led by Kieragh Nelson, a director who joined the firm in . “We’ve got serious ambitions for Merchant Square,” she says. ”There’s a sense of ‘OK, we’ve just opened flagship offices in London, and Manchester – what more can we do in Belfast how can we make it even better ’ And the vast majority of decisions on how it will look, feel and work are made by the team here. Our goal is to create the most technologically-advanced, innovative and collaborative space for ourselves, our clients, and also for the communities around us.”Doing the right thing is a maxim often repeated in PwC, but it gets backed up. On the morning of our interview, a large group of people from the firm, including Paul, took part in one of their regular ‘Darkness Into Light’ walks to raise awareness of mental health. The firm’s commitment to social mobility has seen a number of employment programmes launched, notably the UK’s first technology degree apprenticeships, with Queen’s University one of five universities selected to run the programme. And it’s expanding its Hive Academy programme, which delivers free technology education to primary and secondary schools, to the Channel Islands.This year the firm challenged itself and created a unique charity partnership – the PwC Challenge – to create innovative suicide prevention programmes.“Our purpose is to build trust in society and solve important problems, and it really does feature in how we look at what we do. We strive to celebrate and share our knowledge widely and unselfishly with our people and communities and not be afraid to take a stand and do the right thing. And we put it at the heart of what we do every day. “Take the PwC Challenge: more people in Northern Ireland have died by suicide since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement than from the violence in the years before. This is a crisis, and it’s one which affects our people, and our communities. So we asked local charities in north and west Belfast, the worst affected areas in the UK, to collaborate and devise really innovative approaches programmes to give opportunities to young people and their families through education, technology, sports, and mental health coaching.“As well as the clubs in PwC which fundraise every year for the challenge, our own people are volunteering every week in ious projects – particularly with our Hive Academy. We want to ensure that people, who are high achievers in many dferent fields, are supported to play their fullest part in society.” For Paul, it’s all about the people. Last year PwC invested around £m on staff development here, and this year, a number of people have begun the first Masters in Operation service delivery, run by Ulster University. “It’s important to support people to develop their careers in ways they mightn’t have considered when they joined. That’s a key building block of our purpose – it drives social mobility, equality and ersity.“It’s true thatsomeone decides they want to head off and join PwC Australia or New York, they can. That’s the beauty of working for a global firm – those opportunities are there. But what I really want to make sure is that you don’t have to leave:you want to live and work in Belfast, and have global clients, work with cutting-edge technology and be part of a firm that’s engaged in society, you can do that too.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/eopen_1.jpg","title":"the open its the biggest thing since sliced bread","story":"Posted on Wednesday March  by Ulster Business With just  weeks until Northern Ireland hosts the biggest sporting event in its history, John Mulgrew speaks to the bosses tasked with organising the legendary Open Championship We’ve come a long way in just a short few years. Despite its huge golfing credentials, especially in the modern game, it had been more than  years since Northern Ireland played host to the Irish Open.That all changed in , when it ed north to Royal Portrush. And that, buoyed on a refreshed and renewed interest in both the tournament, and the sport itself.Now, in  weeks, that same links course will see more than , people flock to arguably the world’s greatest golf tournament and the largest sporting event ever hosted on these shores – The Open – transforming a small Co Antrim town for a handful of summer days.“There is a buzz with everyone at the RA,” Johnnie Cole-Hamilton tells Ulster Business. He’s executive director of championships at the RA – the ruling authority of golf throughout the world, aside from areas such as the US, and organisation responsible for organising The Open.“This will be my th Open Championship, and one reason I continue to be involved is that it’s a challenge every time.”It will see Irish golfing greats, including Open winners Rory McIlroy and Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowelland Padraig Harrington – among others – join the biggest name in sport, Tiger Woods.“One of big drivers to ing to Royal Portrush was the success of the Northern Irish and Irish golfers. They have raised the profile of golf immeasurably. “We are absolutely delighted with the response so far – % of tickets sold in  hours, and sold out within a record-breaking eight weeks.”Johnnie says the decision to choose Portrush, bringing it back to the course after a  year hiatus, was the correct one – buoyed by the support from the community, agencies and organisations. The th Open will be held at Royal Portrush from July -.“In my career, we had a similar scenario, ing to Liverpool for the first time in  years, and we had a very similar response. It ed in , and now Royal Liverpool is firmly on the rota, and I hope that Royal Portrush is similar.”Of course, aside from the golf, both the short-term and long-term economic benefits will trickle down and benefit, not on the surrounding areas, but prop Northern Ireland up on yet another global .According to Tourism NI chief executive John McGrillen that longer-term benefit could be worth up to £m for the wider economy.“There will be , tickets sold for championship days, and % of those sold to people out of state, outside Northern Ireland,” he tells Ulster Business.“It allows us to present an extremely positive image for Northern Ireland, and into key markets across the globe. We will never have experienced the opportunity to provide such a positive image of Northern Ireland. Despite what we might think, there are perception issues.“Northern Ireland has a normalised society and some of the most dramatic golf courses, scenery and landscape to see.“More specically, the fact that the Open will have been here, as one of the world’s top golf courses, will drive up the amount of spend, especially from golf tourism.”That alone makes up around % of Northern Ireland’s tourism intake. John says he wants that to grow to £m by . He says golfing visitors spend around four times that of an average tourist.Johnnie says all signs so far suggest that the Open in Portrush is “going to be an enormous” success. But the process hasn’t come without its challenges – namely theIrish Sea.“This is the first Open Championship we have hosted in my time, in which we have a body of water between our base and our contractor base. There’s getting things across water, and an enormous amount of work on the golf course – new holes, a new road system around the course and a tunnel for the players from one of the new greens to tee. You can’t do that without support from the golf club“The members have been hugely supportive, turning the course upside down, but maintaining integrity and enhancing .”He said, along with the blue light services, local authorities, council and tourism groups, the community in and around Portrush “understands that this will bring great benefits” to the area and Northern Ireland as a whole. “You can overcome dficulties with support,” he says.“Royal Portrush has never had more than , people drive to it, or get the train to it, at the same time. It’s a challenge to make sure we deliver a wonderful Open Championship and a spectator experience.”John McGrillen says the triumph in landing the Open itself was down to the success of the Irish Open in the last few years. “You had more than , people turning out at Portrush… visitor numbers had been dwindling.“That allows us to demonstrate that the course can deal with that many people. Everyoneworked very well, collectively, and that gave confidence to the RA that we would have the capacity to deliver it. The risk factors they had were eliminated because of the success of the Irish Open, and that was very critical.”As for boosting many of the hundreds of businesses in and around the area, John said: “It will do, as it’s showing off Northern Ireland… we have seen a big boost in the number of Americans playing golf. We don’t have to wait until after the event. “The visibility the Irish Open has given us. We have Royal County Down, Royal Portrush and Portstewart – that’s increased signicantly. It’s not just those courses which are benefiting – it’s being spread. People will typically stay in Belfast and travel around.”For John, the best outcome is, of course, an Irish winner. Oh, and clear skies. “A local winner would be phenomenal. It would be fantastic to see Rory win, or Tiger Woods.“If Tiger Woods won the Open in Portrush, that would remain in peoples’ memories forever. While we would love Rory or other locals to win, I would not be disappointed in Tiger winning it.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/pwc_1221.jpg","title":"pwc ni to crack  staff by ","story":"Posted on Thursday March  by Ulster Business PwC is set crack the , staff mark by the end of next year as it moves into its new £m offices in the heart of Belfast city centre, Ulster Business can reveal.Just  months after being appointed to PwC’s national management board as head of UK regions, Paul Terrington, PwC’s NI regional chair, has no plans to reduce his commitment to keep growing the business here.“This is an incredibly exciting time to be part of PwC.

As Theresa May is due to bring her withdrawal deal back to Parliament next week, with less than a month to go before the March  deadline, a letter from the CBI, signed by  firms, calls on MPs to unite behind a way forward that avoids a hard border and protects peace and economic progress in Northern Ireland.  It says that “local businesses believe that the failure to approve a deal with Europe on the UK’s withdrawal from the EU will have signicant repercussions for the local economy\". “Such a scenario will both hinder indigenous and foreign direct investment, it would result in signicant job losses and will stle opportunities for the next generation across Northern Ireland.  “We therefore urge MPs across the UK to consider the damaging impact on Northern Ireland’s economy and political stability in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  “The peace and economic progress that flowed from the Belfast  Good Friday Agreement cannot be overlooked at this critical time in the UK’s history.

For some there will be little or no change to their daily lives after the UK leaves the EU. But for others, Brexit may have an impact on some aspects of their day-to-day lives. To provide as much practical information for people across Northern Ireland that is currently available, a Brexit section has been created on the nidirect website. Useful public information is being published on www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit on a regular basis. You may have also seen some of the digital advertisements across Northern Ireland or on your social media channels asking you to visit the nidirect website for the most up to date information. The nidirect Brexit section also points to information being published by the UK Government to give people as much information as possible. At this stage, it won’t answer every question that people will have. But it serves as a useful tool to get people to start thinking about what they may need to do dferently once the UK leaves the EU. Included in the www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit is a section on travelling, which includes the most up to date information for motorists. Depending on how the UK leaves the EU, motorists in Northern Ireland may need a Green Card to drive across the border. A Green Card is an international certicate of insurance issued by insurance providers in the UK, guaranteeing that the driver has the necessary third-party motor insurance cover for driving in the country being travelled to. In the event of a no deal Brexit, motorists in Northern Ireland travelling to the Republic of Ireland will need a Green Card as proof of insurance. There’s also the most up-to-date information from the Department of Health on prescriptions, medicines and medical supplies. The Department of Health has already said that there is enough medicines and medical products to meet current needs. Therefore people should not ask for longer prescriptions and should continue to follow their GP’s advice. Likewise, arrangements for the provision of specic cross border healthcare services made between the Department of Health in Northern Ireland and the Department of Health in Dublinshould not be affected by EU Exit as they are not based on EU legislation. There is also information at www.nidirect.gov.uk brexit along with links to further information for businesses, employers and EU citizens, while information on the Common Travel Areacan be found at https:www.gov.uk government publications common-travel-area-guidance You might not have heard about the CTA before, but it gives British and Irish citizens agreed rights and privileges in both jurisdictions.
