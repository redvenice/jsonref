He added: \u0027So I think they have to relax slowly and we\u0027re going to have to be patient. \u0027And we need a very high uptake in order to have this effect.\u0027The modelling, which helps to explain why Boris Johnson is so reticent to end the third national coronavirus lockdown, comes amid renewed pressure from Tory backbenchers for a \u0027roadmap\u0027 out of lockdown.So far the government\u0027s route out of the cycle of shutdowns initiated last March would see schools closed until at least March 8, with hospitality businesses including pubs and restaurants to reopen as far away as April.  But with Rishi Sunak mulling increases to capital gains tax to pay for the massive £400billion blackhole in public spending accrued during the pandemic and warnings that the economy could take a decade to recover, Tory MPs are likely to be rattled by the new graphs.   St Austell GP practice vaccinates 1,000 people against Covid in 48 hours after unexpected Pfizer delivery - Cornwall Live"},{"url":null,"title":"First look new Union Jack number plates EU flag vanishes UK cars","story":"Share this article \u0027The new designs coincide with the beginning of a number of agreements recently made between the UK and member states for British drivers, making it easier for Britons to drive in the EU when existing restrictions end.\u0027The deal with the 27 EU states plus Switzerland and Norway will make it simple for Britons to drive abroad and forgoes the need for a £5.50 international driving permit.Mr Shapps told The Sun on Sunday: \u0027Changing the designs of our driving licences and number plates is a historic moment for British motorists and a reassertion of our independence from the EU one year on from our departure.\u0027Looking to the future, whether it\u0027s for work, or for holidays abroad, these changes mean that those who want to drive in the EU can continue to do so with ease.\u0027He also tweeted a picture of a new look number plate, writing: \u0027How the new UK number plate looks with the Union Flag and GB replacing the EU symbol.

Every death is a tragedy and leaves behind a bereft family, but it is evident some communities have been hit harder than others.Now, as two politicians from Asian immigrant families, we know the reasons for this go beyond ethnicity. It is to do with socioeconomics – where and how people live – as well as historic issues of racism and inequality in this country. Those from minority ethnic groups are more likely to work in some of the lowest paid, public-facing jobs in the country which has put them at increased risk of catching Covid.It is also to do with history – in the past minorities have not been properly included in some medical research, including trials of vaccines. All this can damage levels of trust. However, this is not the case in the trials of today’s Covid vaccines which have been safely and widely tested across a range of ages and ethnic groups.It is, however, incredibly important to acknowledge these lower levels of trust that some from Black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds have in the institutions set up to represent them, and we will continue to do all we can to address this.We’re pleased the UK has already started rolling out two Covid vaccines, that will eventually get us back to our normal lives, but right now it is how we will protect our communities, our friends and family, our colleagues, our elders.We are calling on people from ethnic minority backgrounds to get their Covid vaccine – it is safe, it is effective and it could save your life or the life of someone you love. This is an issue of vital importance and one that transcends party lines.Last week, Black MPs from the Conservative and Labour parties united against the spread of false rumours about vaccines in a video where they shared heartbreaking stories of losing loved ones to the virus. British Asians have put out a similar video to help dispel vaccine myths.The NHS has been doing an incredible job, rolling out vaccinations across the country – in GP clinics, pharmacies and vaccination centres, from racecourses and leisure centres to mosques and gurdwaras. More than 7.8 million people have now received the first dose, and we have reached the incredible rate of 250 jabs a minute. But it is vital vaccines are available to everyone, regardless of ethnicity, faith or socioeconomic background. We want everyone to get the advice and information they need to make decisions about their health. But make no mistake, the decision to take this vaccine could save your life and stop you ending up in hospital.We are investing a huge amount of time and effort to strengthen the partnership between central and local government and to bring communities closer together in this effort. The government is expanding the community champions scheme so that communities have trusted local leaders who can help answer questions about the vaccine and work with the NHS and public health teams to support local communities. We are both working with faith leaders, grassroots organisations representing our erse communities and charities and have listened to their ideas about how we can protect our communities from coronavirus and get vaccines to as many people as possible.Some have shared concerns over what goes into the vaccines, and whether their faith permitted it. The medicines regulator, the MHRA, has confirmed there are no animal products in the vaccines and imams have declared them to be halal. In recent weeks we have seen the archbishop of Canterbury receive the vaccine and Pope Francis is encouraging everyone to take it.Some have worried about how quickly the vaccine was developed. Others want to know how soon they or their loved ones would get the vaccine. We can reassure people that government is on target to offer the first dose of the vaccination to the first four priority groups by 15 February, and all over-50s by the spring. And that it is safe. Its quick development is down to the effort of scientists and countries around the world.We know people often put their trust in their friends, religious leaders, or family over the government. Events across the country are helping community and faith leaders answer whatever questions people have about the vaccines and how and when they will be invited to get a jab.During the biggest vaccination programme in our country’s history, we want to make this an opportunity to unite, and champion the work of our brilliant scientists, researchers, health and social care staff and frontline workers that have cared for our loved ones and played a pivotal part in the scientific breakthroughs that developed the vaccines.We’ve asked everyone to play their part to protect the NHS, save lives, and get society up and running again, and we know the sacrifices communities have made to follow the rules. Now the vaccines have finally given us hope, we urge everyone but especially people from Black, Asian and ethnic minorities, to find trusted advice, call your GP, visit the NHS website, and encourage your family and friends to protect themselves. When the call comes, it could save their life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92741c3cad9fa7d4e6b617931c7e60319ee5c9d3/0_208_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=027857000ea3532d917a690940f8f43b","title":"iran saudi arabia joe biden cooperation","story":"Joe Biden’s presidency is a chance to build on existing quiet cooperation. Our leaders must grasp it swiftlyBack in May 2019, we – an Iranian former diplomat and a Saudi chair of the Gulf Research Center – called for dialogue between our countries’ respective leaders. We warned that the alternative would increase tensions that could boil over into a catastrophic confrontation.Since then we have witnessed a string of attacks on Saudi and Iranian oil tankers in international waters a major strike on Saudi Aramco facilities at Abqaiq and Khurais a close brush with conflict between Iran and the United States in the aftermath of General Qassem Soleimani’s killing by a US drone and then, late last year, the killing of a top nuclear scientist in Iran. While tempers seem to have cooled since then, we remain at the mercy of a single miscalculation that could turn the protracted cold war between our states hot, potentially ushering in disastrous consequences for the entire region. With the arrival of a new administration in Washington, the time has come to move from confrontation to dialogue.During the past four decades, relations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran have oscillated between confrontation and competition but also cooperation. Today, we are at the bottom of a cycle. Yet we share a sense that while our governments stand at odds on a range of regional issues, there is nothing inevitable about this enmity – nor is it condemned to be permanent.The first step toward a tolerable modus vivendi would be for each side to recognise the other’s threat perceptions – real or imagined – and embrace a set of foundational principles upon which to build.Both Iran and Saudi Arabia perceive the other to be keen on dominating the region. Riyadh views Iran as intent on encircling the kingdom with its allied non-state actors Tehran views Riyadh as a key facilitator of US efforts to contain and undermine the Islamic Republic. Each country believes that the other is determined to spread its own Islamic jurisprudence at the expense of the other. Riyadh considers Iran’s ballistic missiles arsenal to be a threat to its national security, especially its critical infrastructure. Tehran regards the Kingdom’s purchase of large quantities of sophisticated western arms as exacerbating the conventional weapons asymmetry in the region. Riyadh charges Iran with interfering in the internal affairs of sovereign states such as Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Bahrain and Iraq Tehran sees Saudi Arabia doing the same in these very countries.To break this vicious cycle and move beyond the blame game, our leaders need to engage in direct discussions guided by the following fundamentals: i) conducting relations based on mutual respect, according to mutual interest and on an equal footing ii) preserving and respecting sovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence and the inviolability of international boundaries of all states in the region iii) non-interference in internal affairs of states iv) rejecting the threat or use of force and committing to peaceful settlement of all disputes v) rejecting the policy of supporting sectarian isions, employing sectarianism for political objectives, and supporting and arming militias in the regional states vi) respecting the Vienna convention on diplomatic relations, and in particular inviolability of diplomatic facilities vii) strengthening Islamic solidarity and avoiding conflict, violence, extremism and sectarian tension viii) full cooperation on counterterrorism measures ix) treating the religious minority in the other’s country as citizens of that country, not primarily as co-religionists with transnational loyalties x) rejecting the pursuit of hegemony by any state in the region xi) ensuring freedom of navigation and the free flow of oil and other resources to and from the region, and the protection of critical infrastructure and xii) prohibiting the development or procurement of all forms of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).Mutually acceptable guiding principles are a critical starting point. But action is needed to build confidence after decades of antagonism and mistrust. Diplomacy requires dialogue while direct discussions will require a roadmap, which includes a set of reciprocal confidence-building measures and pursues a clear vision for a mutually acceptable regional security arrangement. The United Nations can play an important role in leading or supporting such a regional dialogue process.All this may seem an impossible task for two governments apparently locked in an escalatory cycle. Yet it is important to recognise that both countries have successfully maintained quiet channels of cooperation and dialogue all along. Even amid escalating tensions, Iran and Saudi Arabia engaged in fruitful dialogue over facilitating Iranian Muslim participation in the hajj pilgrimage.Saudi Arabia and Iran have already taken actions that belie the notion of an inescapable, zero-sum struggle. Our two nations can and should build on these positive examples of tentative cooperation to reduce tensions in our volatile region at a time when any spark could set alight the entire region. Joe Biden’s presidency now offers an opportunity for a new beginning. But time is of the essence. Postponing de-escalation would be a grave mistake, as the region has proved time and again that on the rare occasion that opportunities for constructive dialogue present themselves, they must be grasped swiftly before they vanish."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fe219b6f04663be6bb6122685b8d20150d93410/0_229_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=e1fd1af9be62f2dddd125fb153ec1d5e","title":"what did i learn from a time management guru there is only one urgent task for me right now","story":"We need sleep, rest, exercise, love and fun to remain passably human. But for many of us in lockdown, the most pressing job is to avoid conflict with our loved onesTwo years ago, I interviewed an American time-management expert named Julie Morgenstern. I embarked on it in a playful and unserious spirit, thinking I would most likely waste time discussing time with a time expert, only to ignore her advice and get back to wasting more time. Instead, she absolutely blew my mind.A couple of things she said were so self-evident, yet so rarely acknowledged, that I still regularly preach them even now, a mini-evangelist army of one. For instance: “How much time and attention do kids need to feel loved and secure? The answer is this: short bursts of five to 15 minutes of truly unided attention delivered consistently – not big blocks of time delivered erratically.” This completely changed my parenting. Overnight, I stopped hovering about, dispensing non sequiturs while checking my phone, and gave them the full beam of my gaze in much shorter units. I would say this has made me a lot less annoying, although, inevitably, it has increased the proportion of our interactions that are spent on them telling me how annoying I am.There is so much more: Morgenstern is not so much a time management expert as a philosopher of the race against mortality, although, arguably, that is what all philosophers are. Let’s just call her the Hegel of the to-do list.Anyway, she recently said she had some tips on time management in a pandemic, and this is content I am totally here for, as the young people say. Our Zoom was set for 7pm our time, 2pm hers, and Mr Z was trying to give me a glass of wine. I said I didn’t think I could – that might be interpreted as me drinking through a meeting, of which American time-managers would take a dim view.“Americans don’t care if you drink as long as you give them a varietal,” he insisted. It was 6.57pm and I didn’t really have time to find out what he was on about, yet I did want to know what he was on about. “What are you on about? And make it fast.” “Well, you can’t say, ‘I’m drinking wine.’ But if you said, ‘My husband’s just poured me a glass of merlot,’ that would be fine.” I don’t know why he’s right, but he is.“Do we have any merlot?”“We have a fleurie.”OK, I am about to change your life: that 15 minutes of attention for your children? It works on everything, according to Morgenstern. Stop waiting until you have 90 minutes to exercise, or a whole evening to pretend you are at a restaurant, or an afternoon to lose yourself in big thoughts – those things won’t happen. In order to remain passably normal, you need sleep, rest, exercise, love and fun. Sleep, you should continue to plan for in large units of time. It’s just a lockdown after all – you are not sailing the Atlantic. Everything else, throw 10 or 20 minutes at it. You can always find 10 minutes. I just lost seven minutes staring out of the window (which I am filing under “fun” I wouldn’t really call it “rest”).I was chewing over whether this would work – it definitely would for exercise. It is quite a well-established behavioural observation that if you promise yourself it’ll be short, you’re much more likely to do it. But would it work for hobbies? I don’t really have any, so there’s that. I don’t think 10 minutes is enough to lose myself in a big thought. I tried to remember the last time I had a big thought, and started laughing. Is this the right time to mention the fleurie? It’s so easy to mishear, and then it just sounds random. If only it was merlot.“If you have kids that are five or under, the only way to work and manage that is somebody else has got to manage it,” Morgenstern continued. It doesn’t make things any easier, since there isn’t a somebody else. But at least it sloughs off the great lie that you can home school and also work, and that BBC Bitesize or Oak Academy are going to help you with that. The reality is that everybody with children of primary school age or under who has any flexibility in their job is trying to do all their work between 8pm and 1am, leaving them barely enough time to fight with their partner, let alone drink fleurie wishing it was merlot – which is good, in a way, since they have a large number of home school incidents to fight about.For older children, get a whiteboard, stick it somewhere communal, put everybody’s timetable on it: it is incredibly good for avoiding minor mishaps and understanding one another’s rhythms (“This is the time it would be good not to wander into my room naked, as I’ll be on a live lesson” “This is the meeting I’ll be in a bad mood after”) and it gives you “grist to make you closer”, which is Morgenstern’s elegant way of saying “something to talk about”.It’s not really about time management, I realised afterwards. It’s about averting conflict. When you can’t see anybody else, getting on with the people you live with is your only genuinely urgent task. I went in looking for a to-do list, and I came out with just one job. And a glass of fleurie that was still full."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35c24c8ad87ce68fddc572e43176e6ac09606157/0_0_3031_1819/master/3031.jpg?width=685\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25f16a8851a1a089b684e7724517ba0f 685w","title":"ashley walters kids make mistakes i know that now as a father of eight","story":"The Top Boy star on making his directorial debut, becoming a grandfather and hiding his ballet skills from the boys in PeckhamLondon-born Ashley Walters, 38, first found fame under the moniker Asher D, a member of UK garage collective So Solid Crew. He’s now best known as an actor, with film and TV credits including Bullet Boy, Hustle, Small Island and Top Boy. He currently stars in Sky One action series Bulletproof and recently made his directorial debut with Sky Arts short film Boys.Boys is about best friends on an east London estate. Was it inspired by teenage lads getting unfairly portrayed by the media?Definitely. It stems from me going through that with So Solid back in the day. We were villains in the press for a long time. That’s not to say we didn’t deserve it at times. But what I’m trying to say with the film is that kids make mistakes. I know that now from being a father of eight kids. Teenagers aren’t fully grown. They’re not cooked yet, as Judge Judy puts it. They need guidance or they can easily go down the wrong road. A lot of the negative things they do are a cry for help. I mentor kids at my local youth club who are heavily involved in gang crime. If you show them a different way, you can change people. Not everyone in a hoodie is a bad guy.It reminded me of last year’s British drama Rocks…That’s a cool comparison because I really liked that film. Actually, I’ve been speaking to Theresa Ikoko, the writer, about maybe working together someday.Were you keen to show the boys being emotionally open?Very much. We show Hector’s character in some vulnerable places. Opening up was something I had to learn myself. My youth was all about never showing weakness, but I led a double life. I was at Sylvia Young’s theatre school doing tap and ballet but couldn’t go home to Peckham and talk about that with the boys. Although I got caught out once when someone saw me on a poster outside the London Palladium, all dressed up for Oliver!. I got dissed for that (laughs). Experience has taught me the importance of sharing your problems. We have such a high rate of suicide in young men. A lot of that is down to how they think they should behave in front of other people. Breaking down those barriers is difficult but I’m up for trying.There’s an eye-catching piece of “I can’t breathe” graffiti in the film…When we were filming, George Floyd’s killing had just happened. When we saw that written on a wall, it was important to include it. I’d gone through a period when I was being told by people that I wasn’t being vocal enough, wasn’t using my platform, that my silence was helping racism. So that was a way to use my art to say it.Did you feel pressure to declare support for Black Lives Matter?Behind the scenes, I’m fighting for black voices every day. I’ve been doing it for many years. Posting something on social media might raise awareness temporarily but I want to make real change. We need to see more black faces on screen but also behind the camera, be it writing, producing or directing. Bringing new talent to the table will give this movement longevity.Was 2020 was a moment of change?It woke up a lot of people who didn’t realise racism was that bad. It shone a light on how hard it is sometimes to just live your life. It’s little things, too. The other day, I mentioned to a white friend how when planning holidays, me and my wife have to choose carefully which countries we go to. We’ve had so many bad experiences where people aren’t used to seeing black families. This guy was like: “Wow, I had no idea.” Maybe change isn’t happening as fast as we’d like but things are moving forward. Long may it continue.You and Noel are close friends…Yes, but it wasn’t always that way. It used to be normal for young black men in our industry to view one another as rivals. There weren’t a lot of us on TV, which makes you territorial. You’re always pitted against each other for roles. I’d turn up to auditions, Noel would be there and I’d be like: “Oh God, here we go.” Before you know it, you’ve developed resentment for each other. But the day we got a chance to sit and talk, we realised how much we had in common and decided to work together. Bulletproof was our first idea.Are you shooting the next series of Top Boy? What happens with your character, Dushane?Dushane’s back in control but, obviously, you can expect things to go wrong. He’s going to be emotionally tested. There’s devastation and tragedy in his life that affect the way he runs his empire. The story goes to the next level.Drake was instrumental in the show’s move to Netflix. Have you met?Yeah, he’s a good guy it came from a genuine place because he was a true fan, long before he got involved. LeBron James and Jay-Z love the show as well. Last season made a huge impression in the States. They were making memes or posting clips of Americans attempting UK street accents. That was a dream for me. Growing up, we’d watch US shows but they weren’t interested in ours. Social media and streaming services have changed that.How have you passed the time in lockdown?Exercise has kept me sane. I’ve been reading a lot. I’m an Arsenal fan, so it’s Ian Wright’s autobiography at the moment. I’ve also been cooking a lot: lamb stews, butterflied lobster tails, honey-glazed pork chops. My wife wants me to go on Celebrity MasterChef but I don’t want to get ahead of myself. Maybe in a few years.You’ve also been writing scripts. What about?I tend to write what I know. Right now, that’s fatherhood. Much as I might try to write about different things, somehow it always comes back to that. I’m writing a story about a young kid who’s put in the custody of a dad he’s never met before. I first became a father at 17 and didn’t have a clue what a dad was because I didn’t have one myself. So I mashed together all these different role models, some good and some bad, to make up my idea of a dad. I made a lot of mistakes but that’s how you learn.Have you been home schooling?My poor wife’s taken the brunt of it because I’ve been filming on and off. But when I can, I do an hour or two. I have newfound love and respect for teachers. They teach 30 kids. I’m just teaching my six-year-old daughter and that’s difficult enough.You just became a grandfather. How does that feel?It’s a beautiful thing. A very different feeling. And, finally, after all these years, I have a child I can give back at the end of the day.Bulletproof: South Africa and Boys are available on catch-up on Sky On Demand and Now TV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10cbcdd601c8be65ff0c9a772df3a9037f9c0ef1/174_546_5720_3432/master/5720.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=11e78c34628b923b696473758b85284d","title":"bat boxes greened streets and insect hotels barcelona embraces its wild side aoe","story":"The spring lockdown brought butterflies and bioersity to the Spanish city, and inspired a reimagining of its relationship with natureWhen Barcelona’s inhabitants emerged from a six-week lockdown at the end of April last year, they found that while the city had lain dormant, nature had been busy transforming the streets and parks into a bucolic wilderness.“The parks were shut, so there was no pressure on them from humans or dogs and no gardening was carried out,” says Margarita Parés, who heads the city’s bioersity programme.“It was spring and it rained a lot more than usual. The result was an explosion in plant growth, so there were more insects and more food for birds. And there were many more butterflies, as they are a species that reacts very quickly to changes in the environment.”Once the gardeners went back to work, the question was whether to return everything to its neat and tidy state, or let nature take its course?The answer is neither. Parés says the council spent the previous two years working on plans to “naturalise” or rewild the city – and was about to announce this change of policy when the pandemic struck. By the time the lockdown ended, it was a lot easier to sell rewilding to a public craving fresh air and open spaces.The city is now in the process of creating 783,300 sq metres of green open space, including an area around the landmark Sagrada Familía basilica, and 49,000 sq metres of “greened” streets.The city is also encouraging bird and insect life with around 200 nesting towers for birds and bats, 40 beehives and around 80 plantings designed specifically as insect “hotels”. The council has also published a bioersity atlas listing all the city’s flora and fauna.When it comes to embracing nature in its cities, Spain lags behind many countries. But it is hoped that Barcelona’s new policy will go some way to rectifying that.“In a city like Barcelona, it’s a case of replacing what exists with green infrastructure,” says Lorena Escuer, who runs Hydrobiology, a natural pest control company, and has worked in Barcelona on a pilot scheme called Alcorques Vivos, which plants wildflowers at the base of trees in the streets rather than surrounding them with pavement or grating.“It’s not just having a park surrounded by asphalt but introducing nature into the city,” she says. “People need re-educating. Their idea of a clean space is somewhere where there’s no life, where the ecosystem is dead. There’s this idea that nature is something outside and that what’s natural for the city is for there to be nothing.”Francisco Bergua, president of the Spanish Association of Parks and Public Gardens (AEPJP), says it is important for people to see that rewilding is not just a policy of negligence. “No one looks at a flower growing in a stone wall in the mountains as something ugly but the same flower growing in a city wall is seen as a sign of neglect,” he says.Barcelona is unusual among Spanish cities in that it has its own parks department whereas most local authorities contract work out. As a result, in most urban areas the work is seen essentially as cleaning and maintenance rather than nature conservation.“Some people believe that rewilding is an excuse for local authorities not to carry out maintenance and cut jobs, but they’re mistaken,” says Escuer. “These spaces need to be managed but not in the traditional way, which means gardeners have to be re-educated too.”“Naturalising the city isn’t the same as making it a wild space,” says Bergua. “But instead of parks and gardens we need to think in terms of green infrastructure. Doing the same thing in a different way.”Parés says the new approach to gardening should be understood in the context of the city’s commitment to conserving bioersity with a policy that saves water, energy, material and money, and is more sustainable.She adds that there are plans to dig up areas of asphalt in order to make the city greener, but in a city as dense as Barcelona the other option is to go up. Architect Sergio Carratalá and his MataAlta Studio have created a roof garden on an unusually large 19th-century block situated near the old port. Carratalá, who sees rewilding as a form of deconstructing the built environment, has planted the roof with 10,000 native perennials that are pollinator friendly and drought resistant, to provide flowers all year round as well as feeding and nesting places for birds.Rainwater is collected in tanks and the garden is irrigated with pumps driven by solar panels on the roof. When the scheme is complete, it will provide a vibrant slice of nature for the building’s more than 200 residents.Carratalá says Covid has forced us to look at nature in a different way. “It’s made us look at how we live and how we want to live,” he says. “There’s no going back from here.”Bergua agrees. “The lockdown gave us a glimpse of nature in the city and we liked it.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/949ed0dff9a0a4ecd4fd4004675d1f647489cffc/0_382_5736_3442/master/5736.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=53353a15830cee502257364b2e165467","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"The best of the week’s wildlife pictures from around the world, including a Eurasian lynx and rescued caymans"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cdcb303aba7a5bdae2d5b3c0c2ec55eb25d13a4b/240_144_3359_2016/master/3359.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57b77f31f4f04d8d7f8f330395d6e475","title":"animals of the far north in pictures","story":"The BBC series Stormborn, which is narrated by Ewan McGregor and begins tonight, charts the breeding seasons of reindeer, seals, otters and foxes across Scotland, Norway and Iceland"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dc0c6d76a7458ac64525fc8ec2b8e19a87cf5ef/0_40_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1a2262572368f1717cf4678ce8253242","title":"brighton hove albion tottenham hotspur premier league live","story":"Leandro Trossard’s first-half goal was enough to secure a first home win of the season for Graham Potter’s team against a very poor TottenhamHere’s Nick Ames’s report from the Amex. Leandro Trossard, the goalscorer, speaks. It’s a great result, we were nearly there against Fulham. It’s a sweet win. We waited a long time, we were the better team and it feels great. We always try to finish off those moves and I am really happy that we could score. We needy to go on now. We could have made it 2-0 and we defended well. Tottenham is a great team and we knew they would come at us. Mike in Devizes is not happy: “Jose’s face (82 mins) is not as much a picture of anger and despondency as mine, or most Spurs fans I know. Get this toxic dinosaur out of my club.” Look at the table. Poor reading for Spurs, who have dropped from being top in mid-December to 11 off the lead. And Brighton may be fourth from bottom but have a decent gap on the bottom three. A first home win of the season brings huge celebrations. Spurs slope off and Mourinho’s expression is one of someone who has just swallowed some dog worming tablets. Tottenham were rubbish, Gareth Bale anonymous but Brighton deserved that. Trossard’s goal was excellent. And they rarely looked in much danger. 90+4 min: Spurs seeking a hail Mary, a miracle. Burn again does his job by heading away. And that’s it. All over. 90+3 min: Burn heads away and then Alderweireld is fouled by Mac Allister to eat up more time. Sanchez finds Burn in the corner who holds it up there in the style of Martin Johnson. And they win a corner too. 90+2 min: Lamela and Son both have shots blocked. Brighton retreating all the way back in heavy numbers. 90+1 min: There will be four minutes added on. 90 min: Brighton kick for territory like a rugby team. Tottenham can’t get out. 89 min: Brighton take their time over the corner. Tottenham try to break but March is fouled and more time can be eaten up. 88 min: Son has to go back to try and win the ball back. Brighton holding the ball in the corner, and win a corner. 87 min: Alderweireld goes off with a blood injury after his heroics and comes back on. A free-kick for Lamela to bend in. Or shoot? He shoots straight into Sanchez. A sorry waste. 84 min: Oh my, Lamela almost plays in Moura then Brighton charge on, and should have scored. Gross gets through and centres the ball. Connolly has the goal gaping but somehow Alderweireld gets across. Was the Irishman too casual? 82 min: José is wearing the face of the Lowry Hotel’s most famous guest, and chunnering away to himself. If Tottenham do rescue something, they have been poor. And will have been very lucky. 81 min: The last ten minutes and a big push from Tottenham. Or a damp squib? A penalty claim as the ball comes off Ben White but it came off his chest and not arm. 79 min: Two Brighton subs. Off go Trossard and Maupay. On come Lallana and Connolly, a speedy forward and an old, calm head. 78 min: Trossard is down, and he took a knock after a foul took place after an offside decision. That’s one of the pitfalls of just playing on, as they do for...a reason that escapes me and most others. 77 min: Tottenham - at last - putting on some pressure and Brighton’s defence is edging further backwards. 75 min: Son, from deep, tries a shot. That’s too far to trouble Sanchez, who is called upon to make a far more difficult save from Vinicius. The ball was creeping in at the near post. Does the Spurs revival start here? 73 min: Rhys emails in: “Disappointing stupunditry I’m afraid. We are informed that Tottenham’s starting XI is the first not to include a single Englishman. There are three Welshmen though. Three Welshmen are not ersatz Englishmen are they ... any more than Lloris is. Being a Brit Twit isn’t a good look. Try to avoid it eh.”You will have to point out where I said Welshmen were Englishmen. Did you miss the reference to Cliff Jones? 72 min: Brighton sub: off goes Veltman, on comes Dan Burn. 71 min: Ndombele is down again. And writhing. He got caught on the side of the foot by Maupay. Was it deliberate? Difficult to say. 70 min: Moura has heavy traffic ahead of him. And when Davies on the other flank tries a cross, Ben White stops the danger.68 min: Mac Allister - again - has a shot blocked, and it dribbles to a grateful Lloris. There are claims for a handball. None given. 67 min: Brighton have been defending well, and that’s a clear invocation of the commentator’sMBMer’s curse. 66 min: Bergwijn tries to make his way through but the ball gets stuck under his feet. Then Alderweireld is booked for a fairly cynical hack on Mac Allister. A reducer on the danger man that looked like. 65 min: Jose does not look happy and he can be heard urging Lucas Moura on in Portuguese. 64 min: Moura might add some more speed to Tottenham, and Brighton seem to have sat off already. That seems a dangerous strategy. Mac Allister remains dangerous though, and Alderweireld has to come across to stop him. 62 min: Off goes Bale. He looked well off it, let’s be honest. What next for him? The MLS? Retirement? The Open? 61 min: Another Spurs change is imminent, and it’s Lucas Moura to come on. And it’s going to be Bale, isn’t it? 59 min: We are informed that Tottenham’s starting XI is the first not to include a single Englishman. There are three Welshmen though - Bale, Rodon and Davies. Cliff Jones would be proud. 58 min: Tottenham playing better but Brighton still creating chances, and still probably the better team. Trossard gets the ball in for March and Alderweireld has to make a block. 56 min: Veltman’s header from Gross’s corner. Then White shoots from the edge of the six-yard box and Lloris is forced to make a low save. He might just have kept Tottenham in this one. 55 min: Ndombele has to chase back to stop Maupay getting in. 53 min: Bale chase down the ball but settles for a corner on the right-hand side. He takes it too. It was their first corner all night. Vinicius gets a header in, and Brighton keeper Sanchez makes a save, and with his legs. That’s by far the closest Tottenham have come. 52 min: Son, at last, has a shot. Webster gets in the way. Actual Tottenham pressure. A brief claim for a penalty but it came off Webster’s chest. 50 min: Ndombele seeing more of the ball. But he’s also turned it over too. José will not like that. 49 min: Brighton seem to want to push it in the same style as before, and more power to them for it. 48 min: Tottenham perhaps more vigorous so far in the few moments of this half. There will have been a Portuguese flea in their ears. 46 min: So Spurs have a striker. What difference does it make? Let’s see. Looks like José Mourinho didn’t stay long in the Tottenham dressing room. TV pictures show him hanging around outside. There’s a half-time switch. On comes Vinicius, off goes Davinson Sanchez. More on José from the readers. Justin: “To add to your earlier readers’ points about watching Seagulls mobbing Cockerels etc. Having watched the Peacocks of Leeds spreading their feathers with such flair earlier, I think we can all agree that the dodo will make a comeback before Mourinho’s brood take wing in similar style. Mark is right: Time for Spurs to give him the bird.” Justin, the original one, says: “Just to clarify, I am a long-time Spurs fan. I am wearing a Tom Huddlestone-era shirt as I watch and type this. I am adjusting to this new “philosophy”.”And George: This game is giving me flashbacks of the 3-0 defeat that was perhaps the final nail in the coffin for the Pochettino dynasty. Will the Amex be the signal for the downfall of another Tottenham manager?”Brighton might be disappointed they didn’t get more than Trossard’s goal. They have been superior in all departments. Spurs have been very bad. Gareth Bale has been willing enough but anyone unfamiliar with him would have no idea he was once one of the best British players of the last 20 years. 45 min: Hjoberg tries to mount a one-man attack but runs out of room. Back goes the ball. Maupay plays Mac Allister for yet another shot. It goes wide. 44 min: Tottenham attempt some kind of push, perhaps anticipating what is coming in the dressing room. Brighton though remains organised. 43 min: Bale out on the left? He then moves infield to try and get on the end of a Hjoberg chip. He’s at least trying to force the issue. 41 min: A pass to Bale is cut out. Off go Brighton again. Spurs are hemmed in. They can only resort to keeping the ball as their opponents are looking so organised. 40 min: This is very bad from Spurs. They have offered nothing in attack. Bale ties something on the right, but Brighton hold firm. There seems to be a lack of belief within Spurs. Son has been a passenger. 38 min: Mac Allister shoots but can only win a corner. Dunk head it, and it looks to be going in. Once again it’s Bale back doing the defensive work. 36 min: Sissoko stops March, but did so by knocking him over. March takes the free-kick and Sissoko clears. At least he cleared up his own mess. 34 min: Tottenham having to do more defending. Brighton’s mobile forwards are linking well compared to, well, Tottenham’s immobile forwards. Trossard’s cross almost finds March on the back post. March can’t direct the ball back infield. 32 min: Tottenham fans are not happy. First, David. “Of course it’s obvious, as Mourinho says, that Kane is “irreplaceable”. But replacing him with a centre forward has to be worth a try.Jason, perhaps not a Spurs fans: “I think Spurs vs. Brighton is the most Mourinho, considering the mascots. Seagulls are vicious poaching scavengers. They are not nice guys. Fighting cockerels are big, strong, developed without an obsessive view of the rules, and not always fun to watch. Mourinho’s approach is to convince fighting cockerels to play like seagulls.”And Mark: “I don’t care we are in a final, I’ll start the whip round. Not only is he poison, it’s horrible to watch. Please, Levy. Sack him.”30 min: Trossard sends Maupay away. Then Veltman’s cross is headed away. And what’s this? A Tottenham shot. Son - yes, remember him - charges up, Bale takes part in the move and Bergwijn wellies it wide. 28 min: Bale gets involved...by heading the ball away from a Brighton corner. At least he is showing willing but there is not much happening for him. Mourinho is pacing the sideline and looks even more disgruntled than normal. 26 min: Solly March, to use his full name, booms in a cross. Mac Allister is again involved and Ndombele heads away. He’s taken a knock after a previous clash with Mac Allister. He will be OK to continue.

London-based dermatology registrar Dr Cristina Psomadakis says skin hydration is absolutely paramount to maintaining a healthy skin barrier and ensuring that skin cells shed at a normal pace. Adequate hydration is one of the key elements of a fresh-faced glow and minimises the appearance of cracks, flakes or wrinkles in the skin.This is true for all skin types and all skin tones, which is why hydration is so important. Oily skin and dry skin can both be dehydrated. Drier skin types are usually classified by having fewer oil-producing glands compared with oily or combination skin. However, dry skin can be thirsty with a lack of water as well as oil. By the same rule, oily skin types can also be dehydrated with a lack of water and not oil.But drinking eight glasses of water isn’t the only way to get hydrated. You should also aim to consume water through food too. Eating foods rich in water helps the body to absorb the water more slowly, which means the water we get from foods such as cucumbers, watermelon, bell peppers, strawberries, celery and iceberg lettuce keeps us hydrated as well as giving the body a boost of minerals, vitamins and fibre.There is also a myth that caffeine excessively dehydrates you. It is true that caffeine can act as a mild diuretic, but according to a study by the University of Birmingham, where 50 men habitually consumed three to six cups of coffee a day, there was no evidence to show that they were more dehydrated than those who drank water alone.But when it comes to drinking water, you can get too much of a good thing. Overhydration – or hyponatremia – is a condition where sodium and electrolyte levels can become dangerously low due to drinking too much water. This can cause headaches, nausea, muscle weakness and can even be fatal in extreme cases. So finding the right balance is key.Stress, pollution, blue light from devices, exposure to UV and a lack of sleep can all affect the skin and its ability to retain water and stay plump. Staying hydrated is great for the body and helps to regulate mood. As our brain is mostly made up of water, drinking the right amount of it helps keep headaches at bay. Water is also great for helping us stay more focused. But how can the skin also get a drink of water to help boost its function?Hyaluronic acid – due to the “acid” in its name – might sound a bit scary, but it’s known as a souped-up skincare wonder ingredient for its hydrating properties. ”Hyaluronic acid is a sugary substance that we make naturally in our body – it is found in the skin, eyes, joints, even the umbilical cord,” says Psomadakis. “Hyaluronic acid is classed as a humectant, which basically means it’s a hydration magnet – it helps draw moisture from the environment and surface of your skin.”Whether it’s upping your water intake by drinking it, consuming food with high water content, or slathering on great skincare to help boost hydration, water is definitely key for bouncy, radiant and plump skin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19b616cbd50e4d69d434649fd135693336e1ad19/0_20_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d8b6e0e39fbe0132fe230e98ab26292","title":"dry patches tightness and redness signs your skin is dehydrated and how to fix it","story":"Dehydration can leave your skin looking dull and lifeless – but luckily it’s totally fixable. Here’s expert advice on how to get glowing skin no matter what time of year it isWhen skin suddenly feels tight and looks dull, with fine lines and wrinkles more apparent than ever, it’s easy to panic. But, while it might be easy to assume that the stress of the past year has irredeemably accelerated the ageing process, it’s far more likely that such skin issues are simply down to dehydration. And while that’s not ideal, the good news is that it can be put right.Unlike dry skin, which tends to be a long-term issue caused by your skin not producing enough oil, dehydrated skin is down to lack of water and is usually temporary.“Skin hydration is absolutely paramount to maintaining a healthy skin barrier and ensuring that skin cells shed at a normal pace,” says Dr Cristina Psomadakis, a London-based dermatology registrar. “Adequate hydration is one of the key elements of a fresh-faced glow and minimises the appearances of cracks, flakes or wrinkles in the skin.” In other words, hydration is key to maintaining skin is in tiptop condition. So what causes dehydration in skin?We lose about half a litre of water through our skin on a daily basis. But that varies greatly with climate and exercise. And while it stands to reason that if you’re getting your sweat on, you’re losing water, cold weather – and the sort of lifestyle that goes with it – can be just as much of an issue as hot weather, when it comes to drying out your skin.“Cold weather, indoor heating and hot showers can all wreak havoc on our skin and cause it to lose moisture and become dry and flaky,” says Psomadakis.“It is really important to be proactive and try to protect our skin before it suffers from seasonal assaults. This usually means swapping to a richer moisturiser – or moisturising more frequently.”The top layer of the skin – known as the skin barrier – is the body’s defence against everything the outside world has to throw at it. It not only stops stuff getting in, but it’s also the layer responsible for protecting your skin and holding in moisture, and it has to put up with a lot of abuse in daily life.Stress, pollution, blue light from devices and infrared radiation can also compromise our skin barrier. When the barrier is damaged, the mechanisms that usually help keep skin hydrated and plump don’t work as effectively, resulting in dry patches, tightness, redness and dull skin tone.And it’s worth remembering that skin health doesn’t just work from the outside in. What you eat and drink can also have an impact – as you’ll know if you’ve ever felt desiccated after a big night out. Alcohol – and caffeine too – can take moisture out of your body, and that will show on your skin too.Psomadakis recommends swapping to a richer moisturiser (or using moisturiser more frequently), making sure to wear sunscreen even on cold days and limiting the amount of active or exfoliating ingredients and swapping them for gentler ones instead.Drinking a few more glasses of the stuff isn’t going to do anyone any harm, but there’s no guarantee that all of the H2O you drink is going to make it to your skin. So what’s the answer? Putting water on the skin doesn’t seem to make much sense, either, given how tight skin can feel without body lotion after even a lukewarm shower.Crucially, Vichy Minéral 89 pairs this mineral-rich water with hyaluronic acid, which is increasingly being viewed as the secret ingredient when it comes to radiant, hydrated skin.“Hyaluronic acid is a sugary substance that we make naturally in our body – it is found in the skin, eyes, joints, even the umbilical cord,” says Psomadakis. “As people grow older, they lose some of the hyaluronic acid found on the epidermis, the upper layer of our skin.”Hyaluronic acid, which is a very safe ingredient for all skin types, can be natural, or synthetic, and comes in different sizes. While smaller molecules with lower molecular weights can penetrate the skin, higher molecular weight hyaluronic acid is a larger molecule that sits on the surface drawing water to it, helping to smooth and plump the skin.The hyaluronic acid in Minéral 89 is of natural origin, and is a larger molecule, perfect for counteracting the sort of winter dehydration that your skin is likely to be suffering from. As such, Minéral 89 is the only serum to get the British Skin Foundation stamp of approval, which means the foundation has checked over its research and agrees that it stands up. No wonder beauty editor Funmi Fetto described the easy-to-use serum as being “like a glass of water for your skin”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/94e5c5b14b518c644178e963b0bc9ff38ea3349c/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a498d586dc5ff29d892ecfdccfa63b34","title":"me and my water bottle my journey to drinking eight glasses a day","story":"Drinking the recommended amount may seem like an easy target, but many of us find ourselves consuming less water than we should. Writer Anna Fielding describes how she met her hydration goalsThis is by no means a heroic journey, I’m aware of that. Hydration shouldn’t be hard: eight glasses of water a day – sounds pretty simple, right? It comes out of the tap, ready to drink, right there in your kitchen. You don’t even have to leave the house for it.It should feel miraculous, if you think about it in a historical and global context – all this available water, but its abundance works against it. After all, when choosing what to drink, the taste of water doesn’t quite compare with the bite of a short, sharp coffee, or the sugary funk of pineapple juice.Don’t get me wrong, I’m not against water – that would be ridiculous, like being against land or air. I love to mix it with rose oil and bathe in it. I swim in it. I get mesmerised by fountains. I even enjoy drinking it most of the time.Water, when I have enough of it, makes me feel more fluid. My thoughts flow. My skin is plumped up and glows. My eyes are less tired. My online yoga class is easier and, without sounding like a yoghurt advert evangelist, digesting food is easier too. And this personal experience is backed up by medical advice: staying hydrated improves everything from concentration to kidney function. We’re better, all around, with water and we all know that.The problem I have is that I’m easily distracted, which leads to me not drinking enough water throughout the day. Every time I make the conscious effort to hydrate myself, something gets in the way. It might sound ridiculous to you, but it’s true. Even working from home, a measly 15 steps from the kitchen sink, I get caught up in something else – the news, social media, a message from a friend, something interesting on the radio. In non-Covid times, the distractions were even greater.So I finally made the decision that in order to drink more, I’d have to make a very conscious effort to make drinking a part of my daily routine. I started putting a pint glass on the kitchen counter before going to bed. In the morning, I fill it up and drink it while waiting for the kettle to boil. One pint down without even thinking about it – win! I also keep my water bottle in my bicycle basket now. Even if I’m not cycling, the size of my flat means my bike functions as a hallway table and the bottle sits by my keys, purse and gloves. It’s no longer a kitchen object, it’s a leaving-the-house object.There are times, however, when I still need more – and my skin is the first to tell me. As I get older, hangovers increasingly leave me looking like a dried apricot. Coming in from a cold, windy walk to the central heating pinches my face. Some years ago, I discovered hyaluronic acid. It’s a substance we produce in our bodies, found mostly in our skin, eyes and connective tissues, and its main function is to draw and hold water. It’s a key ingredient in Vichy’s Minéral 89 Serum and designed for daily use. But the Minéral 89 Serum also works wonders for when the skin needs an extra boost: when you’ve spent too long in the sun, or when you’re red-faced post-exercise. When my body needs more hydration than I’ve given it, this serum means that at least it won’t show on my skin.One of the main issues I have with drinking the recommended amount is the fact that I have been told so often to drink more water – usually by a strangely serene person on Instagram or a magazine page – and that it has turned into a chore. There’s something to be said about approaching water drinking in the same way as changing the duvet cover or filing a tax return: not bad once you start and you feel better when it’s done.Adding a mild element of fun to the equation can help too, as I’ve discovered. I now fill a blue glass jug to keep on my desk, with ice and some mint in the summer. For colder days, I fill an old teapot with herbal tea, or slices of ginger to flavour my water. We take our pleasures where we can these days, so using my grandmother’s china or the glass I bought in Venice does give a small lift and certainly makes me drink more.We all want easy fixes – and luckily they are available: apply the product, get the good china out, put things where you can see them, and marvel at how quickly you can drink it all in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/008fde4de742d95b8ac40136d6fa89751880d6a6/0_190_5123_3074/master/5123.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e0834da4def5a06979e43c4e93780c76","title":"prioritise beauty sleep five tips to help boost skin hydration","story":"Even mild dehydration can leave skin looking dry and lacklustre, energy levels depleted and our mood low.

Official advice recommends we drink six to eight glasses (around two litres) of water a day, sipping on small amounts often. You can take it one step further by opting for electrolyte-infused drinks such as coconut water or watermelon juice, which are natural sources of minerals including sodium, calcium, potassium and magnesium.Helping to regulate the fluid balance in your body, electrolytes are essential for sparking healthy cell function and are thought to help speed up recovery after exercising too, particularly if you’ve gone all-out during a sweaty session.Look to smart skincareJust as certain foods deliver key hydration from the inside, smart skincare powered by ingredients that draw in moisture and protect your skin’s natural moisture barrier can work wonders on the outside. “Skin hydration is absolutely paramount to maintaining a healthy skin barrier and ensuring that skin cells shed at a normal pace. Adequate hydration is one of the key elements of a fresh-faced glow and minimises the appearances of cracks, flakes or wrinkles in the skin,” says Psomadakis. “Key ingredients to look for are glycerin and hyaluronic acid.”Vichy Minéral 89 Hyaluronic Acid Hydration Booster, aptly described by beauty editor Funmi Fetto as “a glass of water for your skin”, combines both of these hydrators with the brand’s signature mineralising water to plump up tired skin and protect its barrier function.Calm your mindOur state of mind can have wide-reaching effects on the body, and during bouts of stress or anxiety our skin – the body’s largest organ – can bear the brunt of it. Hormones such as cortisol, which increase in the body when we’re stressed, can lead to inflammation, and flare conditions such as acne, eczema and psoriasis. They have also been shown to impair our skin barrier and increase transepidermal water loss (when moisture is lost through our skin). Daily mindfulness and meditation can help to break the cycle if you’re feeling overwhelmed. Try it with the meditation experts at Headspace, who are currently offering three months of free membership with every Vichy Minéral 89 purchase made on lookfantastic*. “With as little as three minutes practice a day, people can experience the benefits of science-backed meditation, helping the mind to be calmer, clearer, kinder, and more resilient,” says Eve Lewis, director of meditation at Headspace.Prioritise beauty sleepDuring sleep the body repairs itself and replenishes moisture levels in the skin. But studies show that about a third of us don’t get the recommended seven hours of sleep each night. “There is actually some scientific basis to the concept of beauty sleep,” says Psomadakis. “Sleep deprivation leads to increased production of stress hormones and decreased production of antioxidants. This imbalance impairs our skin’s natural defences against external aggressors. This can contribute to loss of hydration, also known as transepidermal water loss, making moisturising all the more essential.”Creating a relaxing bedtime routine can help your mind to switch off before sleep, making good quality rest easier to come by. Try avoiding electronic devices for an hour before bedtime, enjoy an evening meditation to clear your mind, or incorporate a few minutes of relaxing massage into your skincare routine with a hydrating serum to replenish tired skin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42aea3005be4cd41583dd72b2862238eb774e939/0_1126_2508_1503/master/2508.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=4cd47e4f56a1da91e4ada4075523b2d7","title":"pregnant women going for scans alone told they cannot film baby","story":"Exclusive: NHS urged to act after survey finds some women wrongly warned taking photos is illegalPregnant women attending scans and appointments alone are repeatedly being told they cannot record or take photographs of their unborn child to show their partner, according to a survey.NHS trusts have been warned that they could be acting unlawfully if they continue to ban partners of pregnant women accessing hospital appointments remotely. Women are repeatedly being told it is “illegal” to photograph or film their scan, despite this not being the case, said the charity Birthrights, which sought the legal advice.“We are keen to see maternity services accommodate partners in person, in line with national guidance,” said Birthrights’ programmes director, Maria Booker. “However if this is really not possible at some hospitals during the current peak, maternity services must find other ways to ensure women feel supported and partners remain involved.”Claire, who is pregnant with her second child, said she had to go to hospital alone for many extra scans and consultant appointments as her previous baby was born small. Her husband was able to attend the 12- and 20-week scan, but because of a ban on filming he had not yet heard the heartbeat of the baby. “It’s been really hard not having my husband there and I’m left feeling anxious with it all,” said Claire. “And my husband just feels like dads are an afterthought, their feelings aren’t considered.”In December hospital trusts were ordered by the NHS to allow pregnant women to have their partners present throughout scans, labour and birth after growing outrage that women were being forced to go through labour alone, or hear devastating news about miscarriages without the support of their partners.But many trusts continue to restrict access to maternity services to decrease the risk of spreading coronavirus. The Royal College of Midwives has called on trusts to exercise “common sense” stating: “Safety must be the paramount concern.”Birthrights said it had written to the Society and College of Radiographers (SCoR), whose current guidance does not support remote access, arguing that a pregnant woman holding a phone leads to “a taut abdomen, which makes scanning extremely difficult”, and could extend examination times and distract the clinician. The guidance does support providing women with “a short 10-30-second cine clip of the fetus at the end of selected examinations”.But Birthrights and Pregnant Then Screwed argue that the guidance ignores “the clinical nature of partner participation”, adding that a clip “does not fully address the clinical importance of facilitating proper patient participation”.Legal advice from Doughty Street Chambers, with support from Irwin Mitchell solicitors, states that blanket prohibition of streaming or recording when a partner can not attend “is likely to be unlawful, discriminatory and violate both articles 8 and 14” of the European convention on human rights.Joeli Brearley, the founder of Pregnant then Screwed, said not allowing women to document their scans was “unnecessarily cruel”. “It is not illegal to take photographs and videos and for many this is a vital way to help their partner feel included and retain information at this incredibly stressful time.”Faith Salih, an associate solicitor at Irwin Mitchell said it was the firm’s view that the law supported remote participation in antenatal scans. “An outright refusal to make arrangements to enable pregnant women to involve their partners in the antenatal appointments, either by streaming or recording the appointments could breach the rights of both parents,” she said.A spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said it was aware how difficult coronavirus restrictions were for families, adding: “Decisions about access for support partners will need to be based on local information and testing capacity, but the information should be clearly communicated.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/324dd3f4e3fa1b8172c9e31b5e9d8eb1dfe6fc05/0_504_3532_2119/master/3532.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b0f1a3730d376c88b2b99381d4a09899","title":"behind closed doors filipina workers trapped by the pandemic","story":"Journalist Corinne Redfern discusses the impact the pandemic has had on the Filipino women trapped overseas, including Mimi (not her real name) who works for a wealthy family in London for just £5 an hour. Mimi was asked to keep working through the first lockdown with the family coaching her on what to say if the police stopped her. In her spare time, Mimi helps other overseas workers escape situations where they are being abusedAnushka Asthana talks to the journalist Corinne Redfern from The Fuller Project about the impact the pandemic has had on the thousands of Filipino women who are stranded overseas. The Philippine government says that approximately one third of its 10 million citizens overseas are women working in “elementary” jobs – a term widely interpreted as referring to domestic workers who are paid low wages to clean homes, cook meals and care for wealthy families, often under horrendous conditions. Human Rights Watch has long described migrant domestic workers, thousands of miles away from home and hidden out of sight in strangers’ houses, as one of the world’s most vulnerable demographics.  The UK issues approximately 23,000 visas to foreign domestic workers every year, half of whom come from the Philippines, according to reports. In the first two months of the coronavirus outbreak, more than half of the Filipino migrant workers surveyed in the UK had lost their jobs, according to a report compiled in June by Dr Ella Parry-Davies and the Kanlungan Filipino Consortium – a London-based consortium of grassroots organisations advocating for Filipino migrants’ rights. Corinne tells Anushka about Mimi (not her real name), a Filipino woman who works for a wealthy family in London who pay her just £5 an hour and asked her to continue to work during the first lockdown, which was illegal. Corinne also tells Anushka about Rowena, who is trapped in Bahrain by an employer who has sexually harassed her. Her boss has promised to pay for her flight home, but he hasn’t told her when, and so Rowena is currently unable to return to her daughter and her grandson in the Philippines.

During his nightly scans of the sky, Messier occasionally stumbled across patches of light masquerading as the comets he was more interested in observing.Resolving to keep track of these bogus objects, Messier started noting their positions and details.The first entry made by Messier in his compilation was in late-August 1758 with the discovery of the Crab Nebula (M1) in Taurus, an expanding debris cloud from a supernova that was recorded as a “guest” star by astronomers in the Orient in 1054 AD. Further finds soon followed.By February 1771, the list had grown to 45 objects and Messier submitted it to l’Académie des Sciences for publication in their Mémoires.Two further versions were then printed in 1783 and 1784, with the final tally numbering 103 clusters, nebulae and galaxies that were discovered by Messier and his contemporaries. Since then, researchers have used Messier’s notes to confirm an additional seven entries.Probably the most famous Messier find lies in the constellation Orion which is almost due south during the early evening in February and is striking in the number of brilliant stars making up the pattern.The most prominent area is M42, the Great Nebula in the “Sword” that hangs from the Hunter’s Belt which is delineated by three stars in a row. You will notice one of stars in the Sword appears a little fuzzy to the unaided eye.Train your binoculars on the area and that “star” resolves into a bright patch of light with a grey-green hue, while a telescope reveals delicate tendrils of gas draped across the field of view.At 1,340 light years away, M42 is the closest star forming region to us. Right at its heart is a very young cluster called the Trapezium whose age is estimated at 300,000 years, and whose members will blow away excess material to emerge from their cocoon in time.The nebula is illuminated by ultraviolet radiation emitted by the more brilliant cluster stars ionising the surrounding interstellar medium.Studies by ground-based observatories and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have revealed infant suns less than 10,000 years old within M42 which are still hidden within dense dust clouds. Even more intriguing are the proto-planetary disks, or proplyds, that HST photographed.These are sites of embryo solar systems, some of which are being subject to intense stellar radiation from the Trapezium stars. But, like life, the proplyds are tenacious and despite their pummelling, it looks like they will evolve further in time.Glancing through Messier’s catalogue you will find every class of astrophysical object represented. Many of them are important in modern research because of their prominence, and they are generally amongst the first targets for amateur astronomers as they get started in the hobby.This time of year, we can trace the lifecycle of a star in the Messier objects and constellations on view. From the stellar nursery of M42, to the young stars of the Pleiades, the last gasps of Betelgeuse and the scattered ashes of the Crab Nebula, that story has been teased out in our pursuit to decipher the secrets of the universe. Messier surely would be in awe of what we have learned in the last 250 years, as we pay homage to his legacy.The moon this month Last quarter is on February 4th, new moon on the 11th, and first quarter occurs on the 19th. When we see the first quarter moon it marks where Earth was three and a half hours ago in our orbit round the sun. Conversely, the last quarter moon shows where Earth will be three and a half hours hence. February 27th’s full moon can be found in the hindquarters of Leo the Lion.The planets this month Mercury continues its evening sky apparition, but it is now rapidly getting lower in the southwest and will be slipping into the solar glare towards the end of the first week of February.Mercury then swings between us and the sun on February 8th before moving into the morning sky. The innermost planet rises at 6.25am on February 28th and may be seen low in the southeast just as civil twilight commences 15 minutes later.Venus is too close to the sun to be seen this month from Ireland. It is very near Jupiter on the 11th but that dramatic pairing will probably only be spotted from more southerly latitudes than ours.Mars can be found in Aries these evenings and is still reasonably bright, despite it receding further from Earth. The Red Planet is not setting until 2am throughout the month and its travels across the celestial sphere carry it across the border into Taurus on the 24th. The moon is near Mars on the evening of February 18th.Both Jupiter and Saturn are morning sky objects, with the former likely to prove the tougher to spot prior to sunrise. Jupiter rises at 6.40am on the 28th which is the same time as when civil twilight begins that morning.Saturn precedes Jupiter by about 20 minutes so it may be an easier catch. It is within four degrees of Mercury on the morning of February 23rd but the two are very low.Spaceflight this month Mars is centre stage this month for three missions that launched from Earth last July: the UAE’s Al-Amal (‘Hope’) China’s Tianwen-1 (‘Heavenly Question’) and NASA’s Perseverance. Each have different goals, and comprise instrumentation provided through partnerships with other space agencies and institutions.The UAE’s Hope mission is the first to arrive on the 9th, with the objective of investigating the martian climate over a period of two years. Mars was a wetter planet billions of years ago but has lost much of its atmosphere over time. The Hope mission, along with the MAVEN probe in orbit since 2014, aim to find out why this has happened.China’s Tiawen-1 initially enters a polar orbit on February 10th from where it will study the martian atmosphere and produce global maps. An onboard rover will then be deployed in early May on to the planet’s surface. China will thus become only the second nation to land a rover on Mars, and it will join the currently active Curiosity which landed in 2012, along with this year’s Perseverance.Last to reach the Red Planet is the US Mars 2020 from where it will release the Perseverance rover to land on February 18th in the 49km diameter Jezero crater. The vehicle is designed for astrobiological and geological studies of the area and will cache material for a possible future Mars sample-return mission. Perseverance will also deploy the short-range Ingenuity helicopter drone to explore the immediate environment of the landing site.John Flannery is a long-time amateur astronomer with an interest in the history and lore of the sky along with astronomical phenomena observable with the unaided eye.

File photograph: Douglas O’ConnorIreland has nine bank holidays a year and a call has been made to introduce a tenth one to mark the first day of spring and bridge the gap between the January slump after New Year’s Day and St Patrick’s Day on March 17th.Minister of State for New Market Development Martin Heydon has submitted a proposal to Government to make St Brigid’s Day on February 1st a new public holiday, which he said could in some way recognise the enormous sacrifices made by Irish people during the Covid pandemic and highlight better times ahead.Minister Heydon, who represents Kildare South, said: “We all remember the annual making of St Brigid crosses from our school days. “Her feast day on February 1st marks the first day of spring and it is the season when we celebrate hope and new life on Earth.”Mr Heydon’s call echoes that of the Tourism Taskforce which in a report last October said there should be a discussion about whether a new public holiday should be introduced during the off-peak holiday season.Its tourism recovery plan for 2020-2023 points out that Ireland has fewer bank holidays than countries such as Spain (12) and France (13) and suggested that an increase in bank holidays would create additional domestic high spending short break demand and would extend the tourism season.February, July and September are the only months without a public holiday. In his submission to the Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, and Minister for Tourism Catherine Martin – Mr Heydon said it would be a welcome boost for the tourism sector during a quiet time for visitors and a bank holiday on February 1st “would bridge the considerable length of time between existing public holidays on January 1st and March 17th”. The Fine Gael parliamentary party chairman said, “Brigid, considered a patron saint of Ireland, held a unique position in the early Irish church. Scholars tell us that she presided over the local church of Kildare and was head of a double monastery for men and women. “She challenged both men and women today to create a church and a society where man and women are equally respected. At a time when all sectors of our society are working together to ensure equality for all in our country, St Brigid was ahead of her time in this regard.”The Minister said visitors already come to Kildare from all over the world seeking to walk in Brigid’s footsteps. “From this perspective, I see many opportunities for increased tourism opportunities linked with an increase in the celebration of St Brigid in Ireland and around the world, focused around a new public holiday.”He added: “I believe this would also be a very fitting way to recognise the sacrifices of the Irish people during the Covid pandemic and highlight the hope ahead made more significant by confirming a new annual public holiday on February 1st.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4472384.1612107526!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"no major reopening of economy likely after march 5th says taoiseach","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin said the priority was to reopen primary schools on a phased basis with special needs schools first. Photograph: Julien BehalThe hospitality sector will have to wait for an increased rollout of the Covid-19 vaccination programme before it can open, the Taoiseach has said.Micheál Martin said he did not “see major reopening of the economy on March 5th” – the date that Level 5 curbs are in place until – and that the Government would take a “cautious and conservative approach” to lifting restrictions.Stating that the hospitality sector’s reopening would be delayed until the inoculation programme was much further progressed, he added, “I’m not looking at the whole of hospitality – there can be different approaches”.But he said he believed “we will have a critical mass vaccinated by late summer”.“And I anticipate that as we move into quarter two and quarter three, the issue will become vaccine administration as opposed to a supply issue.”Speaking about the rollout of the vaccination programme in a wide-ranging interview on RTÉ’s This week programme, Mr Martin said, “we have to be careful about giving precision decisions” around vaccine dates because “it does depend on supply”.He said the Government had so far fulfilled the commitments they made to having nursing homes residents and staff vaccinated, bar those with Covid-19 outbreaks.They were moving to vaccinate those over 70, he said. The target date for completion of vaccination of that cohort was the end of March and Mr Martin said “we have a back-up plan” if the AstraZeneca supplies do not materialise, with other vaccines.“We’re getting increased volumes from Pfizer BioNTech and Moderna and the Johnson \u0026amp Johnson vaccine was expected in April,” he said. The Taoiseach said he was being straight with people. He could not give precise numbers given the volatility in supply. Ireland was down 300,000 doses that were expected from AstraZeneca, from 1.4 million to 1.1 million but he said “we may pick it up again”. “I do believe the rollout so far has been in line with commitments made”. He understood people’s impatience but said, “we don’t control the external environment around the manufacture of the vaccine”.He reiterated that the priority was to reopen primary schools on a phased basis with special needs schools first, and the construction sector, if virus cases get down below 1,000 daily.Mr Martin also said “there may be news this week” about options for the Leaving Certificate.The examination advisory committee had been meeting but they wanted to ensure that when an announcement is made that “all the Is are dotted and Ts crossed”.“I do get the point that Leaving Certificate students do not have classroom time – that is a very important consideration in terms of the options.”The Taoiseach said there were differing views from the wider student body but “what is clear that we do need to bring clarity and reduce stress”.He also said he did not anticipate a leadership contest within Fianna Fáil when the his term as taoiseach finishes at the end of 2022.Mr Martin also said he did not believe there would be a Border poll within the next five years and he deflected suggestions that he was softening the party’s opposition to coalition with Sinn Féin.Sinn Féin is a “party of ision” he said and wanted “to force a isive debate” in the State, adding that he was taken aback about “the degree to which they’re playing politics with Covid-19”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4472520.1612131978!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"astrazeneca to deliver 9m more vaccine doses to eu says von der leyen","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels last week.

The company would expand its manufacturing capacity in Europe, she said.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said on Twitter that the additional doses “is progress and will mean more vaccines for Ireland in the next two months”.Ireland is likely to receive about 99,000 of the nine million additional doses. The State makes up about 1.1 per cent of the EU’s population of 448 million and doses are allocated in proportion to population. This is progress and will mean more vaccines for Ireland 🇮🇪 in the next two months. https:t.co1XeDDLBqks— Stephen Donnelly (@DonnellyStephen) Last week, AstraZeneca had offered to bring forward some deliveries to the EU. It had also offered eight million more doses to the European Union to try to defuse the dispute but an EU official told Reuters that was too far short of what was originally promised as AstraZeneca had committed to at least 80 million shots in the first quarter.Earlier on Sunday, the European Commission president held a videoconference with CEOs of companies manufacturing vaccines and warned of the threat of coronavirus variants.“It is crucial to prepare for the appearance of such variants,” Dr Von der Leyen said in a statement. On Sunday night, Dr Von der Leyen rejected suggestions that Europe was in a race to vaccinate its population against the coronavirus faster than other countries, saying that it was important to co-operate at this stage of the pandemic.“We want 70 per cent of the grownup population to be vaccinated by the end of the summer,” Dr Von der Leyen said in an interview Sunday with German broadcaster ZDF. She added that supplies should increase significantly in the second quarter when Johnson and Johnson and other pharmaceutical companies overcome early hurdles. A spokesman for AstraZeneca declined to comment on the additional deliveries.The European Union’s civil service is under fire over the slow pace of vaccination in the bloc, with critics pointing to faster progress being made in Britain, Israel and the United States as evidence of a planning failure in Brussels. “I think the only race we are in is with the virus and against time,” Dr Von der Leyen told German television on Sunday evening, adding that she had agreed with British prime minister Boris Johnson that factories in both regions would deliver doses to each region.– Reuters Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons january 2021","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2020 by clicking here or call 0844 871 1514. To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Housebound elderly have \u0026#39slipped through cracks\u0026#39 in Covid jabs rolloutA dog is for life, not just for lockdown, charity warnsShantyTok: Chart success for postman as Wellerman reaches No 1 Donald Trump impeachment: when is the Senate trial and what are his chances of a comeback?Dogs are a woman\u0026#39s best friend, new study revealsComment: Britain needs more AstraZenecas if we are to thrive in the futurePublic \u0026#39should be told to consider face masks in some outdoor spaces\u0026#39Exclusive: Chips or salad?

Again concerns about peace in Northern Ireland were raised and the PM stressed the UK’s enduring commitment to the BelfastGood Friday agreement.Mr Johnson then phoned Mrs von der Leyen.By now the warnings about threats to the Good Friday Agreement had been heard in Washington DC, where sources said the White House was urgently trying to clarify what the move would mean.In the face of such raw anger and growing international concern, Brussels backed down.Just before midnight UK time on Friday Ms Von der Leyen posted a message on Twitter saying she agreed with Mr Johnson not to add restrictions to vaccine exports.It was a week that began very differently. Brussels had been determined to force AstraZeneca to its knees. It ended, however, with the European Union humiliated.Mrs von der Leyen was facing calls to resign on Saturday, and fierce criticism in her home country of Germany.It was after all the Commission President who, having taken personal charge of the AstraZeneca issue, and was now seen to have badly botched the response to the pharmaceutical company’s failure to fulfil EU orders of jabs.By moving to impose a “vaccine border” on the island of Ireland she was seen as having trashed the bloc’s reputation worldwide and sacrificed the moral high ground the Commission had taken over the Irish border during the Brexit negotiations.Her decision to trigger Article 16 of the Brexit treaty’s Northern Irish protocol, achieved the once unimaginable feat of uniting an unimpressed Michel Barnier, Irish prime minister Micheál Martin and Boris Johnson against her.Mrs von der Leyen may have ordered a U-turn late on Friday and blamed the crisis on “an oversight”, but the damage was done.It should have been very different. Brussels had planned for the first AstraZeneca jabs to be rolled out across the bloc once the European Medicines Agency approved the vaccine on Friday.The European Commission, which negotiated the supplies on behalf of the 27 member states, would use the delivery as a symbol of the benefits of EU unity.The inconvenient fact that the EU’s vaccination roll-out was lagging far behind Brexit Britain would soon be forgotten in a flood of up to 400 million jabs enough to vaccinate about half of all EU citizens.The day couldn’t come soon enough for the EU’s heads of state and government, who had decided not to use the emergency authorisation procedures Britain used to fast-track the approval of the AstraZeneca vaccine.Commissioners in Brussels sneered that this was a safer, more responsible route than that taken by Boris Johnson.Many EU governments had chosen not to buy doses of rival vaccines, preferring to wait for the cheaper and easier to store jab from the British-Swedish company.The slower pace was, however, exacting a political price on the bloc’s national leaders.Polls in France showed Marine Le Pen trailing Emmanuel Macron by just 48 to 52 in second round voting intentions for next year’s presidential elections.While the UK has distributed 11.86 jab doses per 100 people, France, where anti-vax beliefs have taken root, has only managed 2.08.European newspapers were reporting that Mr Johnson’s vaccine gamble had paid off, which they said was a source of great frustration to the French.Perhaps that is what motivated Mr Macron to trash the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying it was almost ineffective for those over 65, and some say over 60.The cynical ploy came on Friday, the same day that the European Medicines Authority approved the vaccine for all ages, despite an earlier decision by German regulators to restrict it to the over 65s.The German government was also facing questions about why it was lagging so far behind the UK, US and Israel.The strain was showing elsewhere in Europe as well. The normally docile Dutch erupted into days of rioting, their worst in 40 years.The Italian government was tearing itself apart over the handling of the second coronavirus wave. On Tuesday, Italy’s prime minister Giuseppe Conte resigned as his coalition government collapsed.The pressure was on the European Commission to deliver, which explains the furious reaction after AstraZeneca broke the news that there would be a shortfall in the supply.The company would only be able to deliver a quarter of the jabs promised in the first quarter of the year, it said. There would be about 75 million vaccines missing because of production problems at its Belgian plant.Mrs von der Leyen was determined that the member states would not point the finger of blame for the delays at her commission and so the decision was made to launch a full frontal, and unprecedented, attack on AstraZeneca.Suspicions grew in Brussels that AstraZeneca may have sold reserved EU vaccine stock to countries such as Britain, which they claimed had paid a higher price for the jab.Despite the fact that AstraZeneca was providing the vaccine at cost price, the story was given legs by the Brussels spin machine. Their message was clear this was not our fault.Diplomats from the EU’s capitals in the Belgian capital began circulating news stories from last year, when the UK signed a deal with AstraZeneca first.AstraZeneca had imported millions of vaccines from its EU plants to compensate for a delay in production of UK supplies of the jab. Perhaps these were jabs meant for the bloc, the anonymous briefers suggested.The commission, which prides itself on its legal expertise and respect for the rule of law,  turned the screws on AstraZeneca, accusing it of breaching its contract with Brussels.Mrs von der Leyen gave Pascal Soriot, the CEO of AstraZeneca, a dressing down in a morning phone call. It was the first of three grillings for the boss, who was summoned to further two video conference meetings with the EU and national officials later that day.Then Stella Kyriakides, the European commissioner for health and food safety, dropped a bombshell. Brussels would introduce an “export transparency mechanism” by the end of the week, Ms Kyriakides said.  Cyprus’s EU commissioner said that manufacturers in the EU would have to ask Brussels for permission before exporting vaccines out of the bloc.The threat of an EU export ban was clear. Britain, less than a month out of the Brexit transition period and expecting almost 3.5 million vaccines from Pfizer’s Belgian plant, was in the firing line.It was the first of many signals that, as far as the commission was concerned, British public opinion of Brussels simply no longer mattered.On Tuesday, AstraZeneca’s CEO hit back. There was no contractual obligation to supply the vaccines beyond an obligation on the company to make “best reasonable efforts” to provide it, he said.The company’s two production plants in Britain could help with the EU supply but, under the terms of the supply contract with the UK, only after a British order of 100 million jabs had been supplied.An infuriated Brussels hit back hard on Wednesday. It demanded that AstraZeneca ert supplies of millions of UK-manufactured vaccines to the bloc and accused Mr Soriot of breaching confidentiality by revealing details of the contract.Ms Kyriakides said the firm had contractual, societal and moral obligations to use all its facilities to make up the shortfall, and that there was no hierarchy of factories.MEPs began to talk of a vaccine trade war unless the pharma company caved to the demands. Meanwhile Mr Johnson was looking like the only adult in the room.On Thursday, Belgian authorities, acting on a European Commission request, raided AstraZeneca’s plant in the French-speaking region in Wallonia.The reason was to see if the company’s explanation of production problems was genuine but another motivation was to keep the pressure on the company.Having secured AstraZeneca’s permission to release a redacted version of its contract with the EU, Mrs von der Leyen had a salvo planned for Friday.After the contract was released, the commission pointed to clauses it claimed supported its arguments.In one, AstraZeneca appeared to confirm that no other agreement would interfere with its supplies. Another clause said that, for the purposes of the deal, the two UK factories should be considered part of the EU.But eyebrows were raised as Mrs von der Leyen had, that very day, said there were no “best endeavours” clauses in the contract. The published deal, which in another sign the wheels were coming off, was accidentally released unredacted. It had those clauses.She either told an intentional lie to 447 million people or she didn\u0027t know what was in her own contract, Germany’s Bild Zeitung said on Saturday.As EU officials demanded Britain publish its contract with the pharma company, there was growing disquiet among some member states the commission was going too far.But despite the warnings of her own trade experts over the triggering of Article 16, Mrs von der Leyen was set on imposing the hard vaccine border on the island of Ireland.Among the voices arguing against the move was Sabine Weyand, the EU’s top official on trade and former deputy Brexit negotiator. She was the woman who designed the Irish border backstop during the Brexit talks, which was ultimately ditched in favour of a regulatory and customs border in the Irish Sea.In an astonishing gaffe, Mrs von der Leyen only informed Ireland she was triggering one of the most sensitive clauses in the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement after the announcement.She also did not give notice to Britain about the move, which was meant to prevent Northern Ireland becoming a backdoor entry of vaccine supplies to the UK.Considering that the European Commission had spent the previous four years preaching the importance of open borders and peace on the island of Ireland, as well as criticising any suggestion from Britain of using the clause, it was an astonishing move.It wasn’t long before both the Irish and British prime ministers were on the phone to Mrs von der Leyen, both urging a change of tack.So it was that at 11.45pm local time, about eight hours after the announcement, a statement was released saying that Article 16 , the so-called safeguard clause, would not be triggered after all.What Mrs von der Leyen planned as a show of strength and a reassertion of control had demonstrated anything but.The European press was unforgiving, describing it as the “Brexit own goal” and potentially Mrs von der Leyen’s greatest failure.As one EU diplomat told the : “The pressure on von der Leyen is huge and increasing. This is not a good look.”The question for Britain this weekend is how will Mr Johnson use the moral high ground he has gained in the row over vaccine supplies, perhaps to improve Brexit relations with Brussels?One Government source said: There is a window of opportunity and we want to work together, we want things to get better.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain needs astrazenecas thrive future","story":"Almost seven years ago, Pfizer launched its bid to take over AstraZeneca, Britain’s second biggest pharmaceutical company. After a tense stand-off, and no little controversy, the AstraZeneca board stood firm, Pfizer opted not to “go hostile” by taking its bid to shareholders, and the company remained independent and based in Britain.Yet things could have turned out very differently. Pfizer might have made a direct offer to AstraZeneca shareholders. Or the AstraZeneca board might have accepted the bid: they told Pfizer they would have negotiated had the offer been higher. Had a sale been agreed, George Osborne, then Chancellor, would not have intervened. It was, he said, simply a commercial matter. Without AstraZeneca, Britain might not have had a reliable supply of home-produced Covid vaccines.We cannot know for sure. But we do know that Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, intervened to make sure Oxford University did not partner with Merck, a US pharmaceutical, and teamed up with AstraZeneca instead. We know that the European Union has introduced export controls on vaccines manufactured within its borders. And we know that Canada – a country with advance orders of vaccines but no production capacity of its own – has been exposed to delays in production in European factories, and the risk that it will be caught up in EU export controls.The security of supply made possible by Oxford University’s collaboration with a British company, together with the arbitrary and erratic decisions made by the European Union over the last week, has led many Conservative MPs to a policy position they would have resisted in the days before the pandemic. There is such thing as a strategically important industry, they now accept, and such thing as a strategically important company. In other words, not everything can be left to the market: industrial strategy and takeover laws will need to change to make Britain more resilient.This is just one example of how Covid is likely to transform our politics radically. For the pandemic has diagnosed many problems with how we were governed before the virus reached our shores. It has exposed the truth that many of the things we believed and were told were unavoidable, inevitable and natural – just the way things are – were no such thing at all.Take our immediate response to the pandemic. It is often said that it is unfair to judge the quality of Britain’s response to the virus with hindsight. But Covid was not a bolt from the blue. While Asian countries had learned from outbreaks of novel coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS, the West did not. Even as Asian countries started to get to grips with Covid, Britain and other Western countries failed to follow them.In part, this is because the ideological, liberal assumptions of our politicians and officials prevented them from considering the full array of choices at their disposal. As the virus first raged in China, the idea of closing our borders was simply unthinkable to them. Even later, as other countries closed their borders, Britain’s airports were full of people arriving from virus hotspots, like Italy and Spain.More recently, ministers took weeks to restrict travel from regions affected by new strains of the virus, and even then the restrictions were limited in scope. Other measures taken by Asian countries were dismissed as too intrusive for us. It took Britain until last week – more than a year after the virus emerged – to introduce quarantine hotels for new arrivals here. Even now, the rules apply only for travellers from particular countries, and the policy has not yet been put into operational effect.Similarly, despite a willingness to spend £22 billion on Britain’s test-and-trace scheme, there was no willingness to seek access to the kind of personal information, like credit card records and GPS location data, that made the equivalent scheme successful in South Korea. Neither were lawmakers willing to enforce rules on social distancing and wearing masks in high-risk places like supermarkets and public transport.Such shortcomings were not just a question of queasiness over taking emergency decisions. The pandemic exposed the lack of capacity and weakness of the British state. Central government lacked the expertise and logistical capabilities to foresee and fix several important problems, like the procurement of protective equipment for health workers and the wider population.Local government – which could have played an important role in test-and-trace, for example – was neither trusted enough nor powerful enough to perform key tasks. Devolution to Scotland and Wales, and even to the metro mayors, was exposed as haphazard and poorly constructed. And poor state capacity was matched by limited capacity in our domestic economy.The decline of British manufacturing, we had been told for years, did not matter, because our future depended on our success as a services economy. But our struggles with procuring protective equipment, getting testing up and running, and even the early obstacles to vaccine production, were all connected to this lack of capacity at home and a competition for scarce resources internationally. As we now, slowly but surely, begin to turn the corner, Britain’s Covid successes give an indication of how we might do things better in future.Britain was at the forefront of genome sequencing Covid and discovering ways of treating Covid patients. We now run more tests per head than almost any other developed country, and we are racing ahead of Europe with our vaccination programme. Almost nine million Brits have now received one dose of a Covid vaccine, and almost 600,000 received a dose on Saturday alone. Just as our failures can be explained in part by an unbalanced economy, an enfeebled state, and assumptions about the limits of state intervention in an emergency, our successes have occurred where the state has worked strategically, in partnership, with scientific institutions and the private sector.It is this model – a strategic state, seeking to achieve a rebalanced economy, investing in science and working in partnership with the private sector – that can put right our past failures and put our country back onto a path to security and prosperity.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain poised become pacific player","story":"Tomorrow, I will be presenting our formal letter of application to New Zealand and Japan to join them in one of the world’s largest trading areas: the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership. Global Britain is not resting on its laurels after a year as an independent trading nation – we are picking up speed.We are stepping up as G7 President this year to rally an alliance of like-minded democracies in the fight for free and fair trade. We are speaking up at the World Trade Organisation for global rules fit for the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. And we have a great deal with the EU, alongside agreements covering 63 countries.Our trade policy is about the future, but also the here and now. We are now moving decisively towards joining the dynamic CPTPP trading area. I will be pushing on negotiations to secure opportunities for British businesses in the vibrant markets of its 11 members: Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Japan, Peru, New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam.Turbo-charging trade with these economies, which cover nearly £9  trillion of world GDP, will be key to fuelling our economic recovery by supporting jobs and growth for our key industries in every region and nation of the United Kingdom.This high-standards pact removes tariffs on 95 per cent of goods traded between members, provides deeper market access for services – of which we are the second largest global exporter, and cutting-edge rules for digital trade. That will play to our strengths as a world-leading services and technology hub, with fantastic food and drink and advanced manufacturing industries.We will be able to sell more to growing Pacific markets full of consumers craving the best of Britain, whether it’s an Aston Martin classic car, a dram of Bell’s Scotch Whisky, or an innovative service like Deliveroo.This means businesses will have more money to invest in their staff and commercial future. The benefits will be felt across the country, from the Dundee game developers behind Minecraft to the Solihull carmakers building Land Rovers.We will be able to enjoy the full benefits of CPTPP without having to compromise on our sovereignty, our borders or handing over cash to join. This club is all about free trade, and nothing else.We are only able to seize this golden opportunity as an independent trading nation. No longer constrained by the EU, a newly nimble Global Britain is free to go further and faster.The UK is already the first Western nation to start vaccinating people against Covid-19. We are the first new country to apply to join CPTPP since it was set up in 2018. Countries such as South Korea, Thailand and Colombia are queuing up to join.We can be proud that Global Britain is at the front of the queue. It is testament to our preparedness for the negotiations and our close relationships abroad. I have already held discussions with all 11 members – a first for any aspiring member – which shows how seriously they are taking our candidacy.We will negotiate firmly but fairly in the interests of the British people. Our red lines are well-known: the NHS remains off the table, as do our world-class standards – from food and animal welfare to the environment and data protection.Together with like-minded allies, we can take on unfair practices such as forced labour and forced technology transfer, which give free trade a bad name. In doing so, we will demonstrate how much better things should be.Trade is not just an economic boon, but an insurance policy against future shocks. As we have learnt from the Covid crisis, erse supply chains are vital. We must always have friends to supply vital goods, whether food or PPE.CPTPP is an exciting club of sovereign nations, and I believe more will want to join. By positioning Global Britain as the first new entrant, we are helping shape the rules and will reap future rewards.We are out in the world once again championing free and fair trade, driven by our fierce belief that this is the best way forward. This is Global Britain in action. Joining CPTPP will help build a better trading system for us all.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dogs womans best friend new study reveals","story":"While kings, poets and philosophers have repeated the adage ‘dog is a man’s best friend’ a new study argues that it was women who first created the bond between canines and humans thousands of years ago.In one of the first anthropological studies of its kind, researchers at Washington State University revealed that dogs’ relationships with women “might have had a greater impact on the dog-human bond than relationships with men”.  Men may have wanted dogs for hunting or herding livestock but it was women who gave them names and treated them with affection in the way humans do today, they said. “Humans were more likely to regard dogs as a type of person if the dogs had a special relationship with women, the study in the Journal of Ethnobiology found.  Although dogs are one of the oldest and most widespread domesticated animals, very few anthropological studies have directly focused on the human relationship with canines. Anthropologists at the university examined earlier studies on 144 ancient communities from all over the world where there was evidence of dogs being kept. Researchers found thousands of mentions of dogs in the ethnographic documents inside the Human Relations Area files database. In the earliest human settlements where dogs were associated with women, they were given names, allowed to sleep indoors with people and mourned when they died. This bond also allowed the dogs to be more easily trained and thus their \u0027usefulness\u0027 to humans also increased as they were used more for hunting. Conversely, when food production increased, due to advances in crop growing and herding of livestock, the ‘utility’ of the dogs diminished. Jaime Chambers, lead author of the study and PHD student at the university said: “Humans were more likely to regard dogs as a type of person if the dogs had a special relationship with women.“They were more likely to be included in family life, treated as subjects of affection and generally, people had greater regard for them.“We found that dogs’ relationships with women might have had a greater impact on the dog-human bond than relationships with men.” The team also discovered that the warmer the climate the less useful dogs tended to be to humans. Robert Quinlan, a professor of anthropology and co-author of the paper said: “Relative to humans, dogs are really not particularly energy efficient.  “Their body temperature is higher than humans, and just a bit of exercise can make them overheat on a hot day. We saw this trend that they had less utility to humans in warmer environments.” Although there were some exceptions to this with a few dog-loving cultures in the tropics, it was a fairly consistent trend, he added. The findings of the study adds evidence to the evolutionary theory that dogs and humans chose each other, rather than the older theory that humans intentionally sought out wolf pups to raise on their own.  Ms Chambers said: “Dogs are everywhere humans are.  “If we think that dogs are successful as a species if there are lots of them, then they have been able to thrive. They have hitched themselves to us and followed us all over the world. It’s been a very successful relationship.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"eus vaccine blunder has exposed major flaws northern ireland","story":"The latest vaccine procurement calamity, so embarrassing for EU claims of the power of collectivism, has thrown the workings of the Northern Ireland Protocol (NIP), part of the Withdrawal Agreement (WA), into sharp focus - or rather some of its non-workings.In reality, as First Minister Arlene Foster, and respected Unionists such as Baroness Kate Hoey argue, it is time to substantially review the Protocol, and Withdrawal Agreement, and address its wider problems for the British Union. Foster concludes: “The protocol is unworkable, let’s be very clear about that, and we need to see it replaced because otherwise there is going to be real difficulties here in Northern Ireland.” After four years of lecturing about how a hard border on the island of Ireland would lead to outbreaks of terrorism, the EU effectively sought to impose a hard border overnight under Article 16 of the NIP without even telling the Republic of Ireland. In the process they achieved the remarkable feat of uniting every party in Northern Ireland against the EU’s actions, from the DUP to Sinn Fein.As a former UK Government Special Adviser who worked on the Northern Ireland Peace Process, stood behind John Major and John Bruton the day it started, and heard the Canary Wharf bomb go off on the night I celebrated my new role, I don’t need lessons on how important it is to avoid community tensions aroused by aspects such as hard borders. But this kneejerk EU reaction, now rapidly rescinded, illustrates a deeper problem with the special arrangements made to retain peace in Northern Ireland through the Protocol.While there have been teething problems with customs paperwork, generally the Brexit free trade agreement has settled down well. Disappointed journalists have been forced to abandon a free-flowing Dover with no massive truck backups. But in Northern Ireland, there have been reported shortages of certain food products on supermarket shelves coming from Great Britain and in Ireland too – as GB remains their major bridge to the Continent. Amazon and John Lewis also suspended various deliveries due to customs complexities.It is rightly offensive to Unionists to have what may appear to be a form of unofficial sea border between GB and Northern Ireland. The Protocol is designed to allow the EU to monitor the border of its treasured Customs Union effectively. This is why it panicked into trying to protect against a backdoor into the GB for EU vaccines via Ireland.Allowing Northern Ireland to remain within this Customs Union for agricultural and industrial goods allowed many checks to be dispensed with, as that accounts for a great deal of the Northern Irish economy – ingredients like milk, butter, Guinness going back and forward across the invisible land border in different stages of food processing.But it does mean that goods entering the Northern Ireland that remain in the EU Customs Union, or are ‘at risk of’ entering the EU via Ireland - are now subject to customs checks - even if tariffs themselves are zero - if they are coming only from Great Britain, and not further abroad. The complications it seems form around ‘Rules of Origin’, a complex but vital part of any FTA. These rules broadly require a certain percentage – 55 per cent for UK built cars for example – to be sourced from within the exporting local country to avoid import duties. But this works at a more prosaic level of food and groceries.Shortages are down to various reasons, including Covid and Christmas disruption. But supermarkets must also now comply with these rules, involving questions about where product ingredients were sourced from or who produces them. Animal components, such as in pet food, require a vet administered Export Health Certificate.Yes, a bit of a hassle until all set up – the loss of ‘frictionless trade’ was an acceptable price of Brexit for the 7.5 per cent UK economy that export goods - but the three month derogation for packages is helping let the system bed down for many. I always thought there would be problems with the Withdrawal Agreement, but that we should leave the EU and establish the desired FTA first, then rework the WA in the light of what is technically a new deal.It is clear we need a much lighter touch customs regime which does not create such supply issues – after all, world customs practices are moving firmly towards intelligence-led checks, undertaken only if a consignment or operator is suspect. The port of Felixstowe in my former constituency works on just 4 per cent physical checks Ireland even less.The claims of trouble arising from border checks were a shameless political device used by Remainers within Government and the EU to terrify Theresa May into not pursuing the very kind of workable free trade deal we now have in order to stay closer to the European Union (making rejoining easier). This is how the present problems were created. Boris Johnson was right to sign the ‘oven ready deal’, but he will also be justified in revisiting it now in light of the new partnership agreement, and practical experience.He is already on the record warning he could trigger that same Article 16 – which allows for safeguard measures if ‘serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to ersion of trade’ – for the UK’s benefit, telling MPs What I can certainly guarantee is that if there are serious problems in... supplying supermarkets in Northern Ireland because of some piece of bureaucracy that\u0027s misapplied, then we will simply exercise Article 16 of the protocol… It is absurd that there should be such difficulties.”We are still negotiating on services and other aspects such as data, so this is not a major impediment, and both parties have an interest in sorting this amicably now. The EU’s vaccines disaster may well lead to better arrangements for Northern Ireland as a result. That would be a positive outcome.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"exclusive manly fingers point way masculine food choices hungry","story":"When you are looking at a menu, torn between ordering healthily or unhealthily, you would be forgiven for thinking your rumbling stomach might decide for you.But it turns out the answer lies in your hands, because hungry people with manly fingers make more masculine food choices, such as a hamburger and chips, rather than choosing a Caesar salad, a study has found.People who have a ring and index finger similar in length – a biomarker of masculinity – are more likely to reach for stodgy and meaty foods when their stomach is rumbling, according to scientists from Scandinavia. Those with a longer index finger are more likely to crave feminine foods such as fish and salads, the research showed.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that a biomarker linked to prenatal testosterone exposure – ie the digit ratio – interacts with consumers\u0027 hunger levels to affect their preference patterns and choice behavior towards food options with a more masculine gender image, the study says.These findings expand the knowledge on when and how prenatal exposure to sex hormones may affect consumers\u0027 food preferences.Although those with a low digit ratio were men most of the time, there were some exceptions – meaning women can also make masculine food choices under the right conditions and vice-versa.Researchers measured the index and ring finger length of 216 Chinese people, half of whom were female. Each person was assigned a ratio figure that captured how different those two fingers were in length. Those with less difference in length between the two fingers were categorised as more masculine, as a low digit ratio is associated with exposure to higher levels of testosterone in the womb.Consumers with masculine (vs feminine) digit ratios are particularly prone to prefer and choose food options with a masculine gender image when they are hungry, the study says.  Participants were asked to rate their hunger level and then asked to select from foods deemed masculine and feminine. The masculine foods included a fillet of beef, regular Coke, hamburger with chips, hard liquor and lobster. Feminine foods included fillet of fish, Diet Coke, Caesar salad, white wine and shrimps.The researchers suggest adverts promoting masculine food products on television may be more likely to persuade a shopper to buy them if the person has a masculine digit ratio and is feeling hungry at the time, with their findings published in the journal Food Quality and Preference.Differences in finger length have been repeatedly linked to a range of human traits, from aggression to musical ability to sexual orientation.An Oxford University study previously found that women with a longer index finger and shorter ring finger tend to be more attractive to men, making them more likely to have an affair. Men with longer ring fingers than index fingers have been found to be better sportsmen.Those with an index and ring finger the same length are more likely to be heterosexual, while when the lengths differ the person is more likely to be gay.Those with similar length of index and ring finger have also been found to display behaviour traditionally considered more masculine, such as aggression, dominance, competitiveness and risk-taking. Those with a bigger difference in length are more likely to exhibit feminine traits such as co-operativeness and passivity.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"housebound elderly have slipped cracks covid jabs rollout","story":"Elderly housebound patients have slipped through the cracks of the coronavirus vaccination rollout, experts have warned – in stark contrast to the huge success of the Government\u0027s Covid jab delivery to care homes.On Sunday night, homecare providers urged Downing Street to introduce mobile vaccination units to drive from home to home, delivering jabs to elderly and vulnerable people too frail to attend a vaccination centre.The warning came as care homes praised ministers for their success in ensuring that vaccinations had reached their residents.The rollout of Covid vaccines is in stark contrast to the catastrophic death toll in March and April, when the virus took a grip in many care homes. In total it is estimated that more than 30,000 care home residents in the UK have died of Covid during the pandemic – around a third of all fatalities.Concern over the treatment of homecare patients will ring new alarm bells. Dr Ben Maruthappu, the chief executive of Cera, which provides care to about 100,000 vulnerable older people in their homes, said he estimated only around 100 of his clients had so far received jabs. About 55 per cent are over 80, with the remainder in their 60s and 70s and in the most vulnerable group of elderly adults.In all, about one million people are thought to be home care patients, suggesting many hundreds of thousands remain unprotected.Dr Maruthappu said: It\u0027s great that the majority of people in care homes have been vaccinated, but elderly housebound people, stuck in their own homes, are at present not being vaccinated as quickly and effectively as those in care homes. Unfortunately, these people are slipping through the cracks. We look after 10,000 people but only about one per cent – no more than about 100 people – have been vaccinated. Dr Maruthappu said other countries had organised house-to-house mobile vaccination units, adding: We need to do the same. One care home owner who has still to lose a resident to Covid said that, although the battle was being won, he would not celebrate until the war against the pandemic is over. We are so close to the end, said Dr Kevin O\u0027Sullivan, the owner of the Peregrine House care home in Whitby, North Yorkshire. I invoke Armistice Day where, in the six to eight hours between the armistice agreement being signed and enforced, something like 3,000 people lost their lives. I don\u0027t want any of our residents to be in that group.Yesterday marked 21 days since the residents were all vaccinated. We have still not had any outbreaks. A doctor and a nurse visited and administered all the jabs to residents in just under three hours. It has gone incredibly smoothly. We were very pleased. None of his 36 residents, the oldest of whom is 103, has died from Covid in either the first or second waves. However, despite the vaccine rollout Dr O\u0027Sullivan will not lift any of the tight rules in place and visits from loved ones will remain banned in a bid to risk any further infections spreading. The vaccines minister, Nadhim Zahawi, described the inoculation programme as a race against deaths as GPs scrambled to deliver jabs to care home residents. Despite the Government meeting its target to vaccinate the priority group, still more care home residents are continuing to fall victim to the virus. Last week, Pemberley House, a care home in Basingstoke, Hampshire, announced that 22 residents had died of Covid in January. David Crabtree, who manages Crabtree Care Homes, with premises in Bradford and Keighley, West Yorkshire, lost 16 residents to Covid during the first wave of the pandemic. Last weekend, all his residents were vaccinated, and currently 98 per cent of his staff have had their first jab. However, he said he had noticed a slight spike in outbreaks in care homes since the vaccine rollout, adding: If, after everyone\u0027s had two vaccines and we\u0027re still spiking in care homes, something\u0027s wrong, because you can still catch it and transmit it after you\u0027ve had both injections.We still need to be conscious of wearing PPE, and the social distancing precautions which will have to be in place for the foreseeable future.  More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"public should told consider face masks outdoor spaces scientists","story":"The public should be told to consider wearing face coverings in outdoor spaces such as crowded parks, markets and playgrounds, Government scientists have said. Ministers have been urged to draw up stronger messages on the wearing of face coverings in outdoor areas where people are close together and communal areas in workplaces.Papers released by the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) reveal that it is working with the Government on communication strategies about the risks of outdoor transmission.The documents, drawn up by a sub-committeees and endorsed by Sage, says public advice should be strengthened so rules are applied more consistently and effectively to slow the spread of the Kent Covid variant. Consideration should be given to using face coverings in a wider range of settings where people could be asymptomatic and may be in close proximity (less than two metres). This may include outdoor spaces where it is difficult to maintain distance and people may be close together for extended periods, it says. The paper, from Sage\u0027s Environmental Modelling Group says risks are particularly high in semi-enclosed spaces such as transport shelters and street market stalls. But it suggests face coverings may be recommended for any outdoor spaces which are crowded or in which it it difficult to maintain social distance.Drawn up on January 13 and endorsed by Sage the next day, it says face coverings should also be considered in corridors and communal areas of workplaces to prevent the spread of the Kent variant, which may be up to 70 per cent more infectious. It also says workplaces that cannot fully enforce social distancing should consider other strategies to protect workers, such as bubbling groups together, offering regular testing and providing more support to workers to ensure they isolate. It adds that the benefit of face coverings in blocking transmission is difficult to quantify, with estimates ranging from seven to 45 per cent. Studies have found it difficult to distinguish between the effect of face coverings compared to other interventions used at the same time, such as the introduction of social distancing measures.  Current guidance does not say people need to wear face coverings outdoors. Earlier this month, Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer, said people should think about wearing face coverings in situations where they had to huddle together even if outdoors.If people, for example, are crowded together in a queue outdoors, if they\u0027re really huddled together round a market stall or something, that is a risk with this virus and in that situation there might be some logic to people thinking about wearing masks, he said. Asked whether people should wear masks in all outdoor settings, he said the most important thing was that people stayed home unless their journey was essential. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rusty pilots admit making mistakes lack flying time","story":"Airline pilots are making mistakes because they have become rusty because of the lack of flying time during the coronavirus pandemic.Dozens of pilots have told NASA’s Aviation Safety Reporting System that they have made errors since getting back into the cockpit.On one occasion a pilot forgot to disengage the parking brake when pulling away from the gate.Another pilot struggled to land a plane in heavy wind, only succeeding in doing so at the third attempt.Other incidents included a first officer forgetting to turn on the de-icing system, which ensures that the altitude and speed sensors operate properly.The coronavirus pandemic has wrought havoc on the aviation industry with thousands of flights being grounded as demand for air travel slumped.Also, the Boeing 737 Max, which was grounded in March 2019 after two crashes, only returned to the skies last month.According to the aviation analytics company Cirium, nearly a third of the world’s passenger jets have been parked either in central Australia or the Mojave Desert in California.It has seen pilots being laid off as airlines try to weather the financial storm.

I started pressing him to rest but his workload was increasing again, with the Prime Minister keen to launch new thinking on how the government could help the lives of the poorest and saying that, if he managed to negotiate a new settlement for Britain in the run-up to the European Council in mid-February 2016, he would call the in-out referendum that he’d promised in his manifesto. In anticipation, one Remain and two Leave campaign teams had already been set up, with Vote Leave activists disrupting the Prime Minister’s speech to the CBI in November.Within days it became clear how ferocious this throw of the constitutional dice was going to be. Michael Gove, the Prime Minister’s hitherto ally and friend, had declared his intention to campaign against the government even before the Prime Minister arrived back from Brussels. More unexpected was Boris Johnson’s decision to join Michael, since Boris’s position on the referendum had until then been unclear. In total, five Cabinet ministers and over a hundred Tory MPs decided to campaign for Britain to leave the European UnionI got home that evening to find Jeremy already immersed in practicalities. “We have a massive amount to do. For a start, we need to get ready to negotiate agreements with every trading bloc in the world. And the pound has plummeted, so we need to find a way to reassure the markets. But do you know what the most difficult issue is?’The Brexit negotiating challenge became even tougher after the Prime Minister’s next speech, which she gave in the gold-leaf-embossed long gallery in Lancaster House in mid-January 2017. This time, she added another red line – there should be no new barriers within the United Kingdom.The political rationale for this new pledge was clear. A hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would jeopardise the Good Friday Agreement, which had allowed the previously heavily guarded military checkpoints between them to be removed. Many members of the Conservative Party were shocked by May’s decision – including her Cabinet, which was only told on the morning of her announcement. But, since the Conservatives were twenty points ahead in the polls, there seemed little doubt about the outcome...The 10 pm exit poll changed all that – suggesting instead that the Conservatives had lost their majority. After watching some of the media commentary, Jeremy texted Jeremy Corbyn’s office in case they needed to talk later and then went to bed to try to get some sleep.On the same day, after completing his third and final round of immunotherapy, Jeremy had another scan. It had been a difficult week, he told me. He’d spent hours on the phone after the DUP had rejected the original version of the backstop, which had only included Northern Ireland. It had taken days of negotiation before they’d found an acceptable compromise – broadening it to include the whole of the UK – though the DUP still didn’t like it.On 22 March, the other member states broadly endorsed the Prime Minister’s thinking and confirmed that the next stage of the negotiations could begin. The following day, Jeremy put out his quarterly blog to the Civil Service. ‘There are few, if any, peace-time precedents for the scale and complexity of the constitutional and organisational challenge of withdrawing from the EU,’ he wrote.He looked at me, his eyes puffy. ‘No. Not now. But I worry about where we’re going. We have a referendum result and we have what our elected MPs want. And, in the gap between the two, our democracy is ripping itself apart.Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, had used an informal summit of heads of state in Salzburg to attack the Chequers plan.*Witney was Cameron’s constituency in Oxfordshire.Jeremy told himself to stay calm, a message he knew he would soon be repeating to his colleagues. His next step, though, was clear – he needed to give the Prime Minister the best possible advice on the issues that concerned her, and to keep doing that until all her questions were answered and she was ready to make a decision.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"national treasure captain sir tom","story":"NewsopinionNational treasure Captain Sir Tom Moore is in all our heartsSir Tom is the embodiment of a togetherness, an uplting community spirit, which demonstrates why we must look out for each other and wish a speedy recovery to a special old soldiermirrorShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  JAN NewsopinionCaptain Sir Tom Moore has been admitted to hospital \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

The Health Secretary warned we’re going to have a tough few months before lockdown can be eased in England. And he refused to put a date on when restrictions can start to lt - with schools not due to open until at least March . But he struck a rare optimistic note when asked how Britain will look at the start of the school summer holidays. He told regional TV show BBC Politics East: In six months weaposll be in the middle of, I hope, a happy and free Great British summer.  It comes despite Cabinet minister Liz Truss saying - half an hour later - that it was far too early to knowBrits will be able to go on summer holidays abroad. Brits ing from aposred listapos countries will soon have to quarantine in expensive guarded hotels, while others will have to quarantine in their homes on arrival. Asked when the policy would end, she told LBC the virus was unpredictable and it would be very dangerous for a government minister to go on your show making promises about peopleaposs summer holidays. Ms Truss was also unable to say whether pubs , restaurants and theatres would have to remain shut over the summer. The Trade Secretary told the BBC: I donapost think any of us have a crystal ball where we know what is going to happen in the autumn. What we need to do is work really hard now rather than speculating into the medium and long term. When he was asked about July , Mr Hancock did not talk about and was not asked about foreign holidays specically. But he said: I have a high degree of confidence that by then the vast majority of adults will have been vaccinated. “That’s not just the clinically vulnerable groups but then going to all groups, people like me, I’m in my s and healthy and we’ll have got through everybody. “That will give a high level of protection. The more people take up the vaccine the more we’ll be protected as a society… “So I think we’re going to have a great summer but we’re going to have a tough few months between now and then.”  It came as the UK vaccine rollout rose by more than , first doses in a single day for the first time. NHS England had given first doses of a jab to ,, people as of yesterday - up , on the day before. That was more than % of the entire adult population of England, according to NHS statistics. Englandaposs figures alone mean the UK has broken the half a million barrier on one day for the first time. The previous record for the UK was , first doses on January . The figures represent when people were recorded as getting a first doses. They do not always exactly match the date when people had the jab.  Britain has already given first doses of the Covid vaccine to more than million vulnerable people and NHS and care staff. Scientists are waiting for data to show whether getting a jab will stop people passing Covid on to others - rather than simply preventing them getting sick themselves. Dr Susan Hopkins, Incident Director for COVID- at Public Health England, told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “What we’d like to see is a ergence in the case rates in the over-s and over-s who’ve been vaccinated from the younger age groups, to show they’re declining faster. “We’ve now hit % of the over-s being vaccinated and really fast numbers climbing in the under- age group as well. “So we expect over the next two weeks to start seeing that impact of that vaccine in that age group, and also an impact on hospitalisation.” Confirmed cases are also coming down - the rolling average of confirmed new daily cases in the UK has dipped from , on New Year’s Day to , by January . But the Sundaytoday reported social distancing may be needed for the rest of the year despite the vaccine rollout. Government scientists have warned that unless a vaccine is % effective at stopping Covid being passed on - as well as preventing severe illness - they wonapost be able to abandon other restrictions. Modelling by SPI-M, a subgroup of Sage, suggests the UK will suffer a third huge spike in deaths unless the jabs cuts transmission dramatically. It comes as figures show that cases of both the South African and Brazilian iants, which are thought to be more contagious, have increased in the last few days. The vaccines are thought to cut transmissions by around % but it is unclear. Ms Truss declined to rule out that some social distancing measures will have to be in place for the rest of the year. The autumn is a very long time away. We need to concentrate on getting the proper policies and measures in place now, so we can exit the virus crisis as soon as possible, she told the BBC. She added: We can only open the economy, open schools, when it is safe to do so and when we have reduced community transmission. At each decision point we will decide... what steps itaposs safe to take."},{"url":null,"title":"eu covid 19 vaccines explained","story":"NewsEU Covid- vaccines row explained: Will supplies to the UK be affected We want the Pfizer vaccine from the EU - and the EU wants the AstraZeneca vaccine from the UK.

And they want the AstraZeneca vaccine - which is produced in the UK.But what are the actual details of the row  Why did it involve the UK and Northern Ireland  And will supplies actually be hit  Here we take you through the basics of what on earth happened.Whataposs it all about The row kicked off when AstraZeneca revealed it would deliver % fewer vaccine doses than hoped to the EU by March. Due to a production glitch - said to be at a hub in Belgium - it will supply only million doses rather than million planned. That prompted fury from the EU, which complained AstraZeneca continued to supply other buyers at the same time. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Friday: “There are binding orders and the contract is crystal clear.” She is worried because the EU’s vaccine rollout is slipping behind, while the UK is far ahead of any inidual EU country so far. Why was the UK dragged into it Because we’re home to one of the factories where the AstraZeneca jab is produced, and are using it in very large numbers. The EU believed our factory is one of those from which it had a contractual right to demand doses of Covid vaccine. That meant it was hoping to lean on AstraZeneca - possibly with legal action - to sht UK-made doses to the EU. At the same time, the EU is also home to the Belgian plant where doses of Pfizer vaccine are made and shipped to the UK. Brussels officials on Friday announced tighter export controls on doses of vaccine that leave the EU - including those headed for the UK. So as well as demanding doses of vaccine made in the UK, EU chiefs were trying to restrict the number of vaccine doses we get from Belgium. That exploded within hours into a diplomatic incident.  How did Northern Ireland get dragged into it  The EU sparked fury by triggering part of the Brexit agreement as part of its export control on vaccines from the EU. The bloc said it would invoke Aricle  of the Northern Ireland Protocol in an attempt to stop vaccines made in the EU from getting into the UK through the back door. The protocol, which is part of the Brexit deal, allows goods to cross from the Republic of Irelandto Northern Irelandwithout checks. It is vital to preserve peace and stability on the island of Ireland. Triggering Article  would have created a hard border - invoking many of the problems of the Troubles. Northern Irelandaposs First Minister Arlene Foster described the move as an incredible act of hostility and Boris Johnson made a furious call to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Even ardent Europhiles such as the Lib Dems and Tony Blair, plus the Labour Party, condemned the EUaposs behaviour on the issue. Irish premier Micheal Martin also spoke to the European Commission. Has the EU backed down  Yes - although the exact details may have to come out in the wash. After the apoplectic response from the UK on Friday night, the EU confirmed it would not trigger Article . Officials accepted theyaposd made a mistake. On export controls to the UK in general, Ms von der Leyen said: We agreed on the principle that there should not be restrictions on the export of vaccines by companies where they are fulfilling contractual responsibilities. This suggests vaccine supplies from Belgium to the UK - which has a contract with Pfizer - wonapost be blocked. But the power still appears to existthe EU wish to invoke it.  So will our vaccine supplies be blocked or not  Ms von der Leyenaposs statement suggests there will be no block on the Pfizer vaccine moving from Belgium to the UK. And the AstraZeneca jab is made in the UK so we have more control over that. Ministers have said they could send doses to the EU, but suggest this may only be in Autumn once all adults have been vaccinated. International Trade Secretary Liz Truss guaranteed there will be no disruption to Pfizer vaccines being supplied to the UK from within the EU. Askedshe could absolutely guarantee the Belgium-made Pfizer jabs would not be disrupted, she told The Andrew Marr Show on the BBC: Yes, I can. The Prime Minister has spoken to the President of the European Commission, she has assured him that there will be no disruption of contracts that we have with any producer in the EU.Is the UK being given special treatment There’s no doubt the UK is getting extremely high numbers of doses compared to some countries - more than million first doses given out so far. But AstraZeneca insist they’re not playing favourites with the UK government. Chief executive Pascal Soriot said the UK signed its contract with the firm - for million doses - three months before the EU signed its deal for million last year. That means we had more time to iron out glitches in production of the jab, made with Oxford University. UK Vaccine Taskforce chief Kate Bingham said we also started work to manufacture the jab extraordinarily early. She told the BBC we “actually started scaling up manufacture of the Oxford vaccine from February” last year - before a contract was even signed, let alone a jab passing trials or being approved. So essentially, we took a massive gamble on the AstraZeneca jab and it paid off.

Boris Johnson wants schools to be the first thing to reopen from March , but the dates after that are shrouded in uncertainty.Leaked reports - downplayed by No - have suggested England’s shops could reopen in April and pubs in May. UK Hospitality have called for pubs and restaurants to reopen on April  - much earlier - in time for the Easter bank holiday weekend, as long as cases are still falling. But the reality is no one knows exactly when lockdown can end because it depends on so many factors.  A plan will only be presented by the government in the week of February . And some measures are likely to be with us long-term - with one report today claiming social distancing could stay all year. So what are the factors that would allow us to ease lockdown more quickly, and what are the factors that would slow it down  According to Sunday Times calculations, on current trajectories cases could drop to , a day by March . That’s still higher than they were when SAGE demanded a ‘circuit-break’ lockdown in November. Only in May  would we reach the -odd daily cases we managed last July, when pubs reopened after the first lockdown. That trajectory, though, will be affected by all sorts of things that could dramatically change our dealings with the disease.The government is using four conditions before easing the lockdown:A new iant isn’t causing dficulties The vaccination programme is working Hospitalisations are coming down Deaths are coming down.We can be pretty sure the vaccine will bring down deaths, because the aim is to give first doses to the % of people most likely to die by February . But that will take time, and as we know, younger healthy people die of Covid- too. We also know there are no “fixed thresholds” for these four factors - it’s the general progress and direction of travel that will matter. So with that in mind, here are three things that would help improve the odds of easing lockdown - and three things that would make those odds worse. things that would help us ease lockdown If the vaccine reduces transmissionSo far we know getting a vaccine - even just the first dose - makes you much less likely to get sick and die of Covid. What we don’t know, and the government are still looking at, is whether it prevents you passing it on to other people. Government advisors believe it’s almost certain there will be some kind of cut to transmission, they just don’t know how much. If the vaccine has a dramatic impact on people transmitting the virus, then it will help drive down case numbers more quickly. It’d mean a -year-old gran meeting her -year-old daughter wouldn’t just be protected herself the daughter would be safer too.  Dr Susan Hopkins, Incident Director for COVID- at Public Health England, said cases are declining in the over-s and over-s. She’s looking closely to work outthat’s linked to the vaccine - and we should have some idea “over the next two weeks”. She told the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show: “It’s a bit early to say whether those declines are directly related to the vaccine. “What we’d like to see is a ergence in the case rates in the over-s and over-s who’ve been vaccinated from the younger age groups, to show they’re declining faster. “We’ve now hit % of the over-s being vaccinated and really fast numbers climbing in the under- age group as well. “So we expect over the next two weeks to start seeing that impact of that vaccine in that age group, and also an impact on hospitalisation.” If schools reopen without driving cases upSchools will be the first bit of lockdown to end - so will be crucial to showing whether other ‘unlocking’ should go ahead or wait longer. Ministers say schools themselves are safe for pupils, but they can act as a “vector” to spread Covid in the wider community. That means while it’s rare for kids to get seriously ill, they can take the virus home to their families without showing symptoms. But the data on exactly how much this happens, and how much it’s driven in the classroom itself, is mixed and disputed. A Department for Education study in December, presented to SAGE, concluded secondary schools have “an effect” on increasing the spread of the virus amongst children - “but we cannot tell how large this effect is, nor can we tell what the impact of it ison the wider community”. Meanwhile a Public Health England study claimed infection rates remained “very low” in primary schools after they reopened in September . If, as government advisors hope, there is no big leap in cases after schools reopen it will help clear the way to other reopenings. Butcases start rising they will have to rethink. If warmer weather helps cases fall in Spring This winter has felt so long, it’s easy to forget the effect the seasons can have on coronavirus.The fact we got down below  cases a day in July  wasn’t just due to the long lockdown - Spring helped too. It’s now well-established that good ventilation, either being outdoors or opening a window, makes the virus less likely to spread. This is something that happens less in schools, workplaces and homes in winter. Heat and light itself can even have an impact, though it’s less signicant. A paper by a SAGE subgroup on October  said winter conditions “increase viral persistence on outdoor surfaces” and in unheated indoor spaces, due to the cold and low UV light. SAGE member Graham Medley said on January : “Weaposre very hopeful now that this virus is seasonal so that it will reduce once the spring and summer comes. Then that gives us an additional chance to be able to prepare and in particular to get vaccination done for everybody. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said in the same week: “Winter will benefit the virus.”While Britain’s gloomy weather suggests we won’t get much joy until at least April, it could be one factor that drives cases down.   things that would make easing lockdown harder If new iants get into the UKOne reason for Britain’s Christmas explosion in cases was the new iant which began in Kent. Scientists believe it is more transmissible than ‘original’ Covid and it may be more deadly - around a % rise in men aged . So far, early studies have suggested that ious Covid vaccines will work fairly well against the Kent iant. But scientists are worried about South African and Brazilian iants, as well as potential future iants that could resist a vaccine. Early trials for one yet-to-be-approved vaccine, Novavax, estimated it had % efficacy in South Africa compared to % in the UK. Dr Susan Hopkins of PHE insisted this was still “reassuring news” telling the BBC: “I expect that all of the vaccines will have similar levels of effectiveness against [strains] like the South African iant.” Butvaccines have to be tweaked or are less effective against new strains, it could slow down the fall in cases and deathsthose strains become common in the UK. Ministers are also accused of dragging their feet over tightening up the border. Brits ing from Brazil and South Africa will have to quarantine in hotels, rather than in their own homes, but there’s still no start date for the policy.If we unlock too quickly at firstWhen lockdown was eased in July, Boris Johnson steamed ahead by reopening pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and more on the same day. Scientists are warning we must go in two-week intervals to check that unlockings are not driving cases up. If we go too fast, or people are given the impression it’s a free-for-all and break the rules, we could end up with cases and deaths rising and our “unlockdown” going into reverse. Dr Susan Hopkins of PHE warned the BBC: “We have to relax things really quite slowly so thatcases start to increase, we can clamp down quite fast. “The NHS is going to be under pressure until the end of March, as normal in winter, but even more so with the amount of inpatients they still have with Covid-. “Any releases that we have will have to happen very slowly, very cautiously, watching and waiting as we go with a two-week period to watch and see the impact of that relaxation. Because it takes that to see what’s happening in the population.” "},{"url":null,"title":"matt hancock give statement whether","story":"NewsMatt Hancock to give statement on whether hes hit care home Covid vaccine targetThe Health Secretary will give an update after ministers pledged to offer a first dose to all elderly care home residents and their staff in England by January mirrorShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video liz-truss-matt-hancock-give-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

The Health Secretary was expected to update MPs in the House of Commons as speculation mounts about the target of “offering” first doses to all of them by the end of today. However, it is thought he could equally announce the figures at a Downing Street press conference. Mr Hancock is expected to give a statement in the early part of this week as final figures roll in tomorrow. Trade Secretary Liz Truss today said the government still didn’t knowit had hit the target. “The Health Secretary will give an update to the House and I’m sure there will be positive news,” she told Sky News. “We are on track but we’ll get the full report once today is over. We’ll be able to report next week.” The government pledged to offer a first dose to , elderly care home residents in England, plus their staff, by January . The NHS later brought that date forward to January  in a letter to primary care networks - but it was missed.  Boris Johnson told MPs last Wednesday that three quarters of elderly care home residents in England had had their first dose.Updated figures have not been released, as they are not included in official data. Instead the public are forced to rely on Tory ministers dripping out the details when they choose to. There are , residential care staff and .million social care workers in England, many of whom are included in the January  target.

Could a fan boy Boris Johnson who lost the virus war go on to win the peace  The clumsy stupidity of the European Union threw a leline to a Prime Minister betting on staying afloat on vaccines after his Conservative Government’s calamitous errors contributed to the deaths of more than , blameless victims. Mistake after mistake resulting in the world’s worst mortality rate should be chiselled onto Johnson’s political tombstone yet he’s increasingly hopeful an incompetent reign will be rescued and extended by the successful NHS vaccine programme. The near , new jabs announced emphasised how much the country finally has a world-beating response to be proud of after topping body count tables. Much of the credit must go to the NHS, delivering the doses at breakneck speed and illustrating one of Johnson’s earlier lethal mistakes was to put profit-hungry companies in charge of test and disgrace. But a discredited Government also deserves recognition for ordering vaccines when the faltering European Commission was still filling in forms. Britain could’ve legally pursued its own inoculation programme while in European Union member, the jingo-istic bile of Brextremist vaccine nationalists deeply unpleasant with lives also endangered on other sides of the Channel.

Pregnant with my first child, I smiled as I imagined the moment our baby would be placed in my arms, my husband Chris and I gazing at him lovingly. I thought maternity leave would be full of coffee and cake, baby swimming and baby yoga classes. Sam and I didn’t get to experience any of that. I went into labour six weeks early in October . Sam was “back to back”, which meant I was in a lot of pain and was rushed for an epidural. “I’m frightened,” I said to a midwe as I was wheeled to the delivery room. Sam was distressed and his heart rate was dropping, so forceps were used to get him out. It was a chaotic delivery and Sam needed to go straight into special care. As the epidural wore off, I started shaking with shock. “You’ve had a bad tear,” a midwe explained. It extended from my vagina to my rectum, but I’d been stitched up and presumed I’d get better. After a few days, I could not understand why I had faeces in my pants, or where it was coming from. I was in excruciating pain, but when doctors examined me they said the tear was healing.  I didn’t want to cause a fuss, but the pain got worse. A nurse tried to examine me but couldn’t get near me without me screaming. I had to be given gas and air so they could examine me. I was told I had a fourth-degree tear, a huge abscess and a rectovaginal fistula, which is an abnormal connection between the rectum and vagina. My only option was to have a colostomy, which would ert faecal matter from the digestive tract through an opening in the abdominal wall, known as a stoma, into a colostomy bag. I was told the bag would be needed for  weeks, to give the wound a chance to heal. I spent two weeks in hospital and was taught how to clean the stoma. I hated it, but as it was only going to be temporary I tried to cope. In just three months, I told myself, this would all be over and I could get on with motherhood. Catastrophic damage A month after Sam was born, I received a letter from the hospital saying that the tear should never have happened and an investigation had been launched. I thought I’d just been unlucky, but it was dawning on me that something really terrible had happened. I wonderedI’d ever be able toto the job I loved, in the police force. The colostomy bag would fill at the most inappropriate times, and it was always leaking. I couldn’t even look after myself, let alone do such a full-on job. During check-ups, doctors realised the damage to my sphincter was much worse than they thought. I met with the consultant who had delivered Sam and she apologised. “I don’t want your apology,” I said. “If you hadn’t got Sam out, he would have died. You made a mistake, which has had catastrophic consequences for me, but don’t forget you saved a child’s le.” I didn’t want to sue, but I needed to be recompensed because I was being medically retired due to what happened. For my case to progress, I had to have many intrusive, horric tests. These confirmed the tear had caused so much damage I’d need a colostomy bag forever. I was diagnosed with postnatal depression and PTSD. Emergency operations Because of the fistula, every time I exercised and got hot, I got an infection, leading to sepsis. I was put on heavy-duty antibiotics and twice needed emergency operations to drain the sepsis. Chris worked away on oil rigs so I was often alone with Sam, and I was a mess. We’d be in a supermarket and the bag would suddenly fill and start to leak. One time, I had to ask a stranger to watch over Sam while I dashed to the loo. I felt so lonely and isolated.  The friends I’d made at a prenatal yoga class had textbook births and were busy enjoying motherhood. I hid the bag under loose clothes because I was so self-conscious. I had to move slowly due to the fistula, and a walk to the woods near our home which used to take  minutes now took over an hour. It took a year before Chris and I could be intimate again. I had to be careful of how I held Sam in case he accidentally kicked my stoma. It felt like I was keeping him at arm’s . It wasn’t until Sam was seven months old that I gazed down at him and realised I loved him. I didn’t blame Sam, but I felt angry for the damage his birth had done to me. With therapy, I understood we had been through a trauma together and he was a daily reminder of what happened, but we were both so lucky to be alive.  Looking for hope When Sam was two, the NHS Trust settled out of court. I spent a lot of time asking, whatthis had never happened to me  I scoured forums looking for hope, but all I found were other people with stomas saying they couldn’t go camping, cycling or swimming. Once I’d had surgery to fix the fistula, le improved, and I could finally start exercising more. I was overweight and unfit, but I felt determined to reclaim my body and my destiny.  My first challenge was the Chevy Chase , a -mile hike across the two biggest hills in Northumberland. It took almost eight hours, but I did it. Now, with my trusty colostomy bag by my side, I have competed in triathlons and half-Ironmans. I’ve skyed and been wild swimming, wild camping and sea kayaking. Sam and I took a scuba-ing course, something I was specically told I’d never be able to do with a stoma. Never let your fears stand in the way of your dreams.

Rogeraposs Wholesale opened its fth branch in Stockport on Saturday, having already opened its doors to excited customers in Poole, Plymouth, Southampton and Bilston. Masked shoppers eager for a bargain queued up outside the warehouse on the Bredbury Park Industrial Estate, Stockport, before flooding in to have their pick of the bargains. Great towers of tinned food stacked up on huge pallets and row-upon-row of colourful drink bottles greeted the shoppers as they rushed inside. Bargains on offer include  Lucoade originals in a case for just £, .kg of Honeycomb Cinder Toffee for £ and  Starbucks Double Shot Intenso for £. The storeaposs managing Mark King, , said he was inspired to open the huge warehouse stores after becoming annoyed about the amount of food waste.He told the MailOnline : I myself hit hard times and had lost my job through no fault of my own and did not have much money.I was struggling to afford to feed myself even though I had no kids or family. People who are homeless are covered by good charities and get a lot of help from supermarkets. The scenes moments after Rogeraposs opened were reminiscent of the first lockdown back in March, when shoppers piled food and drink into trolleys and baskets to stock up on essentials. Mask and glove wearing shoppers streamed into the store, enthusiastically wheeling their trolleys around the colourful, maze like aisles. They were channelling a bulk buying energy seen in supermarkets up and down the land since the pandemic first began. While empty shelves have not been as common in sight in the third national lockdown as they were in the first, many Brits are still doing extra big shops to avoid making too many trips out.At the beginning of January pictures emerged of supermarket shelves being stripped of frozen and cupboard goods. The need for affordable food has never been so vital, especially with many people left unable to work during the Covid crisis and not able to access government financial support. The hunger charity The Trussell Trustaposs most recent analysis forecasted a  per cent increase in food parcels needed across its UK network in October to December, which works out as six parcels given out every minute.During the start of the pandemic, around half of people who used a food bank had never needed one before, the charity added. Trust chief executive Emma Revie said: “Throughout  communities across the country have stepped in to provide vital support to people left without enough money. Volunteers in foodbanks have been working hard under extremely dficult circumstances to make sure support is there for people struggling to afford essentials.

Blue Sandford, , has become the public face of the underground protest against the proposed high-speed rail line. She and her fellow protesters have spent the past five days ft under the capital’s streets as bailfs try to evict them. Blue, whose wealthy father Roc lives off-grid on a Scottish island, has accused the bailfs of risking their lives by removing drainage systems. But the defiant teenager is still refusing to leave the tunnels - saying she is more terried of climate change. Blue, who is ‘on strike’ from her studies at her £,-a-year school, told the Mail on Sunday she hates the comparison to Greta Thunberg. She said: “It’s really strange being right at the centre of this huge thing but I canapost just sit at home. “I am really terried of the climate change disaster we are facing and I donapost know what  to do to change things.  “HS is incredibly damaging and despite the Government declaring a climate emergency they are not following through on it at all.” She accused bailfs of “dirty tricks” - something they deny - but said she and her fellow protesters remain “in good health”. “It’s been cold since the eviction team brought in a huge compressor and sent a hose down blasting air along the tunnels,” added Blue.“Weaposve got lots of sleeping bags, though, and weaposre taking it in shts,with some sleeping, others awake having some food.“We have enough stores to last six weeks. Iaposm surviving on rice and tins of jackfruit, as well as pastries and other stuff collected from skips.”  Her dad Roc, a environmental activist, defended his daughter’s actions and the green campaigning carried out by his other children. “They have completely outclassed me in their protests, which proves it isnapost coming from me,” he said. “I am always begging them to be careful. I sometimes feel like I’m going to collapse with fear, but I am also so proud of what they are achieving.  “I’m a parent, not an eco-warrior, and I am terried of the future we are cooking up for our children. “I have been going through a really dark and miserable place knowing I could lose them.” The government claims HS - which is set to link London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds - will lower carbon emissions.  But protesters say the lines will destroy or irreparably damage  ancient woodlands and  wildle sites. They also claim Euston Square Gardens will be built over by a temporary taxi rank before being sold to developers. An HS spokesman denied claims bailfs are flooding the tunnel system to remove the protesters. “We are pumping air so that the protesters can breathe. The activists have dug a crude and poorly constructed tunnel.

Infact,it wasn’t for the familiar white gown she wore on her own wedding day, she would struggle to recognise herself as the bride in her own wedding album. For Lauren suffers from a condition known as face blindness which means she struggles to recognise people. While most people admit to forgetting a face sometimes, Lauren’s problem is so severe that she doesn’t always realise she’s looking at her own reflection, can’t recognise her best friends, famous people and struggles to spot herself in photographs. There is no cure for her condition but she has learnt to rely on mannerisms, habits and the way people speak before she recognises people. Lauren, , of Derbyshire, said: “It can make le pretty tricky sometimes. “I can’t always see myself in photographs which can be embarrassing. If someone shows me a picture and the person had dark hair and is about my height I think ‘why am I being shown this photo, it must be me.’ “There’s been times I’ve looked at pictures and thought ‘that looks like a nice place, when did I go there ’ Then I’ve realised it’s someone  entirely.” Lauren’s condition has led to some very red-faced situations.  She didn’t recognise a woman at her birthday lunch who came hurtling towards her with a huge grin. Yet the mystery female had been her best friend from the age of  – and Lauren was bridesmaid at her wedding less than a month before. It was only when her friend Hannah started talking that Lauren realised her pal had flown more than , miles from Australia as a birthday surprise. Lauren said: “I try to deal with it with humour and there have been some very hilarious things happen, like spending  minutes talking to the wrong person on a video call or mistaking an ex boyfriend for someone .  “On the serious side it can impact on your-self esteem and sense of competence, that general feeling of being able to negotiate the world and people. “I spend a lot of time jumping through hoops under the surface trying to work out who I’m talking to.” Lauren gets embarrassed as she tells how she failed to recognise Hannah – but she’s not the only close person she’s got confused over. She said: “I think the problem was Hannah was out of context. She was meant to be in Melbourne, not Britain, and something like that can really throw me. “We’d been together just over three weeks earlier when I flew to Australia to be her bridesmaid. “The funniest thing was, I knew my husband Jonathan had planned some sort of surprise for my birthday and at one point I was staring out the window, looking at this blonde woman in the car park, not realising it was the woman who had been my best friend for years.”  Lauren’s condition is so bad that she sometimes thinks she is looking at someone  when she sees herself in a mirror. She said: “I’ve been at a busy restaurant and found myself apologising to someone in front of me for getting in their way. I’ve taken a few side steps before realising it was my own reflection in a fullmirror. “I’ve given up watching movies because it’s too confusing. If there are two blonde women who look similar in the same film I can’t tell them apart and the plot gets very mixed up. I prefer reading books. “I can’t recognise famous faces eitherthey are out of context. I’d be able to tell you who Alan Sugar washe was sitting behind a desk in The Apprentice, for instance, but I’d struggle to recognise The Queenshe was wearing a tracksuit.” Despite not recognising her best pal, Lauren rarely has a problem recognising others and family, including husband Jonathan, because she is so close to them.  Lauren only realised she suffered from prosopagnosia aged  when she read a book by neurologist and famed author Oliver Sacks, who also has the condition. Around one in  people are thought to suffer from face-blindness to ying degrees.Some may fail to recognise people they’ve met a handful of times while others, like Lauren, struggle on a day-to-day basis. Lauren said: “When I was younger I guess I must have thought everyone was the same. “I went all through primary school thinking two boys were the same person and once thought a girl in my class was a boy until she wore a skirt one day. It was only when I read about prosopagnosia that I realised ‘that’s me’. “If I meet someone on the street I can sometimes tell who it is because they have a distinctive beard or glasses. If I’m not sure who it is I’ll ask a few questions and try and place them. “I don’t tend to tell people about my condition because it just leads to more questions about it.

It is thought the -year-oldaposs announcement will mark the first time an acting headmaster has come out in front of their students. Mr Hewlett said that he was inspired to do so by a student at the £, a year school, who chatted to him openly about their sexuality. The courage the student exhibited made him determined to be open and honest about his own situation. Mr Hewlett hopes that his announcement will be met with a positive reaction and that some pupils may even wave rainbow flags.“My only regret is not doing it earlier, because seven years of children will have gone through the school without the benefit of a role model, he told The Times.The message is simply have the courage to be true to yourself. The headmaster said society has come a long way since he was a pupil at Whitgt school in the s, when the term aposgayapos was bandied around as an insult. When he began working in education Mr Hewlett was warned his sexuality would serve as a barrier in his career path.

The mum of three said: “This year’s Children’s Mental Health Week is all about expressing yourself – about finding creative ways in which to share your thoughts, ideas and feelings. “So whether that’s through photography, through art, through drama, through music or poetry – it’s finding those things that makes you feel good about yourself.” The future queen highlighted the crucial need for parents and carers to look after their own mental health while being in the country’s third lockdown, and pointed to the impact that this has on the children in their care. Kate last week confessed to being left “exhausted” by homeschooling children Prince George, seven, Princess Charlotte, five and Prince Louis, two, during an online chat with parents over their experiences of lockdown. She said: “I think as parents you’ve the day-to-day elements of being a parent, but I suppose during lockdown we have had to take on additional roles that perhaps others in our communities, or in our lives, would have perhaps supported us and helped us with. “Personally, I feel pulled in so many dferent directions and you try your best with everything, but at the end of the day I do feel exhausted.” The royal last year launched her landmark survey on the Early Years, ‘ Big Questions on the Under-Fives’, which aimed to spark the biggest ever conversation on early childhood that will ultimately help bring about positive, lasting change for generations to come.  The research revealed that whilst  per cent of people acknowledge that maintaining parental mental health is crucial to support the health and happiness of their child, in practice the majority of parents struggle to prioritise their own wellbeing. Kate added: “There has never been a more important time to talk about parental wellbeing and mental health too. “Last year you told me just how important this was that many of us find it hard to prioritise. “This is a hugely challenging time for us all so please look after yourself too. “Find those ways in which to share your thoughts and your feelings or find someone to talk to because we really do need to be the very best versions of ourselves for the children in our care.” "},{"url":null,"title":"labour party plan help 11m","story":"NewsFirst-time buyers dream homes become living nightmare costing them thousandsUnder Labour’s plans, a National Cladding Taskforce would conduct an audit on the extent of dangerous materials still on buildingsmirrorShareCommentsByPippa CrerarDaily Mirror Political EditorAmy-Clare Martin:,  JAN NewsSarah Rennies high-rise block is unsafe \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get US and UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Labour is setting out a list of demands as analysis shows that up to  million people are at risk from huge costs and unsellable properties. The Opposition is calling for a new National Cladding Taskforce after years of Government delays to protect leaseholders from bearing the cost. And on Monday night they will force a symbolic Parliamentary vote to pile pressure on dozens of Tory MPs who are understood to want the Government to do more. Boris Johnson last week said ministers would set out plans “very shortly” with Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick pushing for a more generous rescue package. This could include a levy on construction firms, caps on inidual repair bills and grants for those in the riskiest high-rise blocks. But campaigners have warned ministers are looking at a controversial “cladding tax” proposal where building owners would be offered long-term loads which would then be passed on to leaseholders through service charges. Labour leader Keir Starmer said: “Today needs to be a turning point for those affected by the cladding scandal. “Millions of people have been sucked into this crisis due to years of dither, delay and half-baked solutions from the Government. “For many leaseholders, the dream of home ownership has become a nightmare. They feel abandoned, locked down in flammable homes and facing ruinous costs for repair work and interim safety measures.”  Under Labour’s plans, a National Cladding Taskforce would conduct an audit on the extent of dangerous materials still on buildings. They would then prioritise them according to risk and ensure enforcement against owners that fail to start imrovement work. There would be up-front funding to remove deadly cladding immediately, with those responsible for putting cladding on buildings taken to court to recover costs. And a hard deadline of June  would be brought in for all high-risk buildings to be made safe. Labour will amend the Fire Safety Bill to protect leaseholders from being passed historic fire safety costs and ban ‘gagging clauses’ for residents in unsafe blocks. There are still  buildings with Grenfell-style ACM cladding on them more than three years after the disaster, which took  lives. The fire exposed decades of weakened regulation, failed inspections and substandard construction. Since then, the Government has put forward £m to fund the removal of ACM and a further £bn for other types of cladding. But this covers a fraction of the tall buildings affected by dangerous cladding, and excludes buildings below m high. An MHCLG spokesperson said: “We are considering a range of options to fund future remediation work and this work is ongoing. “We continue to work with stakeholders including leaseholders and the finance industry, and we will set out further detail in due course.” Jenni Garratt  Jenni Garratt, , is forking out £ a month - double her mortgage payments - for a waking watch until a fire alarm system is installed. An intensive fire safety inspection of the development in Sheffield also forced leaseholders in the top five floors to evacuate over safety fears. Remediation costs for the cladding have been estimated at £.-.million. And as a leaseholder she will be landed with a bill of £-,their application to the Building Safety Fund is unsuccessful. She told the Mirror: “I was  when I bought my flat. I would describe it as the proudest moment of my le. “I have graduated from uni and I worked since I was  to save up and buy as soon as possible. “It feels completely unfair that I am now being subject to these costs for something I never could have foreseen.” Sarah Rennie   Leaseholder and wheelchair user Sarah Rennie, , must evacuate down  flights of stairs in the event of a fire after discovering cladding on her high-rise block is unsafe. When she bought the flat, which she has adapted for her needs, the advice was to stay put. “It’s definitely impacting on my physical and mental health,” she told the Mirror. “Emotionally I feel betrayed that I was mis-sold my flat. “I also feel frightened thatthere is a fire I am going to be the last one out -I get out at all.” The accessibility specialist has already received a £, service charge bill for increased buildings insurance and a -hour waking watch. She will also face a £, bill for remedial works on her high-rise block in Birmingham,their application to the Building Safety Fund is unsuccessful.

When he failed to pay the fixed penalty notice issued by the council, he was taken to court, where he was found guilty and ordered to pay a total of £ in fines and costs.It comes after a council crackdown on owners not acting responsibly and clearing up after their canines. Last year it was revealed dog walkers who fail to pick up after their hounds while out getting their aposessentialapos exercise during the first coronavirus lockdown risked getting fined.Plymouth City Council said its environmental enforcement officers were set to hit the city’s streets and parks in a bid to curb a recent increase in dog fouling.A council spokesperson said: Since social distancing measures were introduced, the council has seen a rise in reported cases of owners failing to pick up after their pooches. At the beginning of the coronavirus crisis, enforcement was not deemed an essential service. However, because of the hazardous nature of dog waste and its dangers to children, officers will be back on patrol from Monday. Unormed and plain clothed officers will be patrolling areas of the city where complaints have been received.Earlier this month PlymouthLive reported on a pop-up ‘poo protest’ planned for Burrator Reservoir by Dartmoor residents who are fed up at the sight and smell of bags of dog excrement left hanging on their fences."},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markle quietly changes name","story":"NewsMeghan Markle quietly changes her name on Archie’s birth certicate in snubThe one-year-old birth certicate was changed a month after he was born and no longer shows Rachel Meghan as his mum but Her Royal Highness the Duchess of SussexmirrorShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video harry-meghans-year-review-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Little Archie was born on May , , and his birth was registered  days later before an amendment was made on June . The totaposs birth papers no longer shows aposRachel Meghanapos as his mum instead it reads aposHer Royal Highness the Duchess of Sussexapos. The unusual change occurred as rumours were growing of a rt between Harry, brother William and their partners, The Sun reports. They claim the move is a snub to the Cambridges as all three of their children have Kateaposs names on their birth certicates. It may also be viewed as Harry placing Meghan at equals with his mum Princess Diana who always used “Her Royal Highness the Princess of Wales”. Days after the changes were made, Harry and Meghan walked away from the Fab Four’s joint charity and had quit the Royal family within months. The caustic split from the royals was dubbed aposMegxitapos by commentators. Harry and Meghan have since moved to North America with Archie and secured lucrative deals with powerhouse companies like Netflix and Spoty.  Lady Colin Campbell, who discovered the amendment, said: “It is extraordinary and raises all kinds of questions about what the Sussexes were thinking.” Dickie Arbiter, the Queen’s ex-press secretary, said the changes could be an early part of their plan.” Royal expert Ingrid Seward added: “For a royal to change a birth certicate is unprecedented but to remove forenames is remarkable. “Perhaps this is another sign they were desperate to do something dferent to the Cambridges.”  The news comes as reports claim Meghan may notto Britain with Harry during several planned visits later this year. The Duchess of Sussex is said to be unlikely to accompany her husband at a number of s this summer - although the move is not said to be a snub. Sources, speaking to the Daily Mail, said the choice has been made for several reasons and her absence will avoid the inevitable public and media hype a joint appearance would bring.

In a statement to the Independent, the spokesperson said: The change of name on public documents in  was dictated by The Palace, as confirmed by documents from senior Palace officials.This was not requested by Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex nor by The Duke of Sussex. The Sun had claimed the move could have been a apossnubapos to Prince William and Kate Middleton, who included Kateaposs names on their childrenaposs certicates. But the spokesperson added that the claim of a potential “snub” would be “laughable were it not offensive”.

Our team watched as families braved the cold and rain to collect much-needed supplies. Caring school staff set up the mobile scheme after realising youngsters were going short of essentials during the lockdown. Patrick Ottley-O’Connor, head of Westhoughton High School said: “We found that the students were writing on any bits of paper they could find because they were running out of resources at home. “So we set it up a bit like an ice cream van, stopping off at places at certain times so people know where it is, delivering paper, calculators, pens, that sort of stuff. “It went really well on the first day and then we had requests for things like yellow paper.”  The van has also started carrying sanitary products for pupils, who would normally have been able to access them at school. He added: “We have got some hardshipso we put snacks and fruit and those sorts of things on, so the bus has started to grow.”To donate to the appeal please click  hereNext week staff will also start collecting donated items for the local foodbank. “We have had a real outpouring from parents to support what the school has been doing” he said. “A group of parents are now asking what they can do to help. Some parents have said ‘can we give money’, so we are setting up something so we can target and donate to those families who are in need.”  Deputy head Claire Cronin said: “In order to make sure no student was left behind we spent a huge portion of out budget purchasing laptops back in September. We have been distributing to families who had IT issues,it was just a phone or one laptop between a whole home, they have been our first priority. “But then some of the parental feedback showed that parents were running out of stationary and that was the idea behind the bus from our business manager, Ann Butler.” Three days a week the bus leaves the school and drives to pre-arranged distribution points. The school has more than , pupils and has had up to  parents a week using the service. We met the van in a leisure centre car park alongside the school in Westhoughton, near Bolton, Greater Manchester. Barbara Fawcett, , arrived with her son, Jayden, , and daughter Brooke, seven, to pick up pens, lined and plain paper and pencils. The accountant said her family are not struggling financially but plenty of others are. And she thinks the government should be doing more for schools and pupils. “At the moment the children are not being served justice. They are being served injustice” she said.  “I think the government should be targeting money to the schools. The schools are working very, very hard, as you can see at Westhoughton High School. “If the government could give them a helping hand they would be able to get more stuff out to the pupils who need it.” She added: “Let’s get the pupils through the pandemic.

Huge ft waves overcame the flood defences at Chesil Beach on the Isle of Portland, in Dorset, last night, with water sweeping inland and carrying cars away. A coastguard was seriously injured when a  foot high wave hit them as they tried to warn storm-watchers to leave the area last night. Flooding has also hit Devon, Gloucestershire, Hertfordshire and other parts of the UK amid torrential downpours and snowfall across the country. The Met Office has now warned of potentially  inches of snowfall in an alert for Wednesday. The warning states: Further spells of snow, heavy at times, will continue to affect parts of northern England and Scotland during Wednesday. Snow is most likely to fall on higher ground, mainly above  to  metres.

Pictures from Gloucestershire on Saturday morning showed a childrenaposs playground partially submerged in Tewkesbury and vehicles driving through rising floodwaters in Lower Apperley. There were similar scenes in Henley-on-Thames in Oxfordshire, where water was seen rising on to the towpath, surrounding benches and approaching riverside homes.The wintry weather will continue next week.Met Office forecaster Simon Partridge said: It gets a bit more interesting as we go into Tuesday and the middle of the week.

She also thought she had no remaining family left apart from her daughter following the death of her husband in . So she was stunned to receive a message from kind-hearted Adam Simpson-York to say he had bought Charles’s medals on eBay. The -year-old has spent lockdown buying unwanted medals online and then trying to reunite them with the soldiers’ families. He managed to track down Jocelyn after researching her family history and contacting relatives she didn’t know existed. Adam, from Ipswich, Suffolk, has now gted her the service medal and victory medal, which he bought for £ for the pair. Jocelyn has also contacted the  surviving second-cousins she had no idea existed - including some living down the road from her. The social worker, from Peterborough, Cambs, said: “What Adam did was absolutely incredible.  “He went through so many stages of research to contact me, and was able to tell me things I never knew about my own family. “All I knew about my grandad was that he had lived in Doncaster and worked on the railroad for  years. “And then to find out I have  second cousins that I never knew about - it’s been an overwhelming experience. “It’s like I gained a new family in the space of  hours. I’m going to hold these medals close to me for the rest of my le. It’s unbelievable.”  “I don’t know how to describe what this means to me. “Covid- has brought some dark days, but this feels like suddenly there is a light in my le.” Charles’s medals had been lost for over  years before appearing for sale on eBay before Christmas. Adam secured the help of Jocelyn’s second cousin Rob Sharman - who she did not know existed - to learn more about the soldier. Jocelyn said: “Thanks to Adam and Rob, I now know pages and pages of information about my grandfather that I never knew before.

The Royal added that there is no way to downplay organised violent extremism on social media.  Royal author Angela Levin said Prince Harry should droll all his titles and take American citizenshiphe wishes to have the sort of freedom that allows him to speak on political matters. She told Express : If he wants this sort of freedom he should drop all his titles and take American citizenship.Of course having his titles has enabled him to do ious lucrative deals but he can’t or shouldn’t have it both ways. I think Harry’s decision to lecture anyone on how to live, what to do and who to vote for is a misjudgement. And even more so in the United States. Ms Levin added that Prince Harry should especially not speak out as a member of the Royal Family who is still using his Royal titles. The idea of members of the British Monarchy not speaking out stems from the long-upheld tradition of staying non-partisan while carrying out their duties.Rumours over whether the Duke of Sussex will take up American have swirled since he moved to Calornia with his we Meghan Markle in March .Meghan reportedly cancelled her plans to become a UK citizen after the move, as there is no reason to pursue the application.

The couple purchased stud work timber, gas struts and door hinges at BQ for £. And after only four hours, their hidden stair nook was complete. We took inspiration after seeing something similar on a DIY page I follow, Heidi, a paediatric nurse, said. We have lived here for a year after buying our first home together and want to put all the clutter that accumulates in the hallway in the new storage area. It was actually super simple to make. George lted the carpet and marked out the outline, then cut out steps using a jigsaw. He then built wooden supporting framework to reinforce the staircase structure. Then we installed the hinges and gas struts, and cut and re-fit the carpet.Heidi later shared the results in a post on Facebook, which has so far attracted , likes.Since being shared online, a number of people say they want to recreate the aposcraftyapos storage solution themselves. One person said: That is the best thing Iaposve seen in ages and I can think of a lot of uses for it. Thataposs awesome. This guyaposs three steps ahead, joked someone . A third person commented: This is absolutely brilliant and just so clever. Meanwhile, others expressed it would make the perfect hiding spot from unwanted visitors - or each other. Great hiding place from an axe murderer, one person commented. Be ace for hide and seek, one person wrote, tagging a friend who then added, From the police... Another person joked: Somewhere to hide the kids. Others were scared of creepy crawlies getting in to the house, with one person writing: I would love to do this but would be scared of the spiders.

As boss of Tesla, SpaceX, and co-founder and founder of Neuralink, and The Boring Company, the -year-old clearly knows what heaposs doing when it comes to business. Plus he recently became the worldaposs richest person with a net worth crossing £ billion, so itaposs not a surprise that everyone wants to know his hiring trick.Musk is not interested in which school a prospective employee attended or even their level of education, reports the Daily Star.“There’s no need even to have a college degree at all, or even high school, Musk said during a  interview with Auto Bild. Instead, the father-of-seven looks for evidence of exceptional ability when it comes to hiring new staff. If there’s a track record of exceptional achievement, then it’s likely that that will continue into the future, he said. Of course, itaposs easy for someone to lie on their CV or about their achievements, but Musk has a question that is designed to catch liars out. Speaking at the World Government Summit in , Musk admitted he asks each candidate he interviews the same question: Tell me about some of the most dficult problems you worked on and how you solved them. A study published in the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition in December  uncovered several approaches to spotting liars based on a job interviewing technique that actually backs up Muskaposs technique.  One such method is called “Asymmetric Information Management”and is designed to provide an interviewee with a clear means to demonstrate their innocence or guilt to the investigator by providing detailed information. Small details are the leblood of forensic investigations and can provide investigators with facts to check and witnesses to question,” Cody Porter, one of the study’s authors and a Senior Teaching Fellow at the University of Portsmouth, wrote in an article for The Conversation. She specically said that interviewers should give clear instructions to interviewees thatthey provide longer, more detailed statements about the event of interest, then the investigator will be better able to detectthey are telling the truth or lying.  In contrast, liars wish to conceal their guilt,” Porter explained. This means they are more likely to strategically withhold information in response to the AIM method. Their assumption here is that providing more information will make it easier for the investigator to detect their lie, so instead, they provide less information. The study also found that using the AIM method can increase the likelihood of detecting liars by nearly  per cent.

Supporters of Alexei Navalny have been staging events demanding his release from prison and about , people have already been arrested on Sunday, including Navalnyaposs we Yulia. The army has reportedly been called to support the police in St Petersburg, the home city of President Putin, as they struggle to cope with the crowds of protesters.Tear gas was used in some of the worst scenes of street unrest since Putin came to power more than two decades ago.While brutality was caught on video as police sought to crush protesters in Moscow, St Petersburg and Vlaostok. One video shows a journalist who works for major newspaper Kommersant - owned by pro-Putin billionaire Alisher Usmanov - being aggressively held. Incredible footage from early on Sunday showed undeterred protesters holding hands and dancing in a circle on the aposfrozen oceanapos of Amur Bay, near Vlaostok, as they chanted aposPutin is a thiefapos and aposshame shame shameapos. They chanted in unison as a law enforcement boat broke down while chasing crowds on the thick sea ice in -C temperatures. More protests were held some  miles away in Yakutsk, the the world’s coldest city where the cold drops to an unimaginable -C. Not everyone supports the protests however, with one middle-aged woman heard to shout to police “spray water on the protesters”, which could prove fatal give the temperature. Larger rallies are also beiing been held in cities like Moscow, and come after around , people were arrested during clashes with police last week. More than  people are understood to have already been arrested in eastern Russian cities today, on the second weekend of unsanctioned rallies demanding the release from jail of Putin foe Navalny.In the Russian Far East and Siberia the formidable riot police presence - seen on videos - and threats of harsh detention appeared to have cowed people into staying away compared with last week. In Krasnoyarsk, protesters used a traditional ‘khorovod’ folk dances in minus C temperatures to express their opposition as they were ringed by a wall of heavily armed police.An exception was Novosibirsk - Russia’s third largest city and unofficial capital of Siberia - which had some , walking on a main street chasing ‘Freedom, Freedom’. In Tomsk, a noisy demonstration shouted: ‘Freedom to Alexei Navalny.’ In Chelyabinsk, crowds shouted aposBrutalityapos as police manhandled two young protesters to detention. Dear god, how did we get to this  cries a woman.In many cities officers had ‘avtozaks’ - cells on wheels - awaiting the protesters. Piles of snow, and chopped trees, were also used by the authorities to block the way of protesters. Navalnyaposs supporters in Moscow plan to rally near the Kremlin administration and the headquarters of the FSB, the KGBaposs successor, later today. Protests in support of -year-old were called for in  cities across the country’s  time zones, with the largest beginning due in Moscow at noon local time.  The anti-corruption campaigner is currently held in jail accused of parole violations. Navalny claims this and expected new charges are “political” from the Kremlin which is scared of his popular appeal. He accuses Putin of ordering his murder following his August poisoning with a nerve agent. Some of his closest aides have been detained, too."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/syndicatenews/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2020/12/HEALTH-Coronavirus-Scotland-10374869_37182082-e1607361179350.jpg ","title":"coronavirus 93 new cases across tayside as 40 people test positive in fife","story":"There are more than  Covid patients in hospitals across Tayside and Fe.The latest update from the Scottish Government shows there are  people from Tayside in hospital with a recently confirmed case of the virus and eight receiving intensive care treatment.In Fe,  people who have contracted the virus are in hospital and five of them are in the intensive care unit.A further  cases of coronavirus have been recorded by NHS Tayside in the past day and  people have tested positive in Fe in the same time period.A further , new cases of Covid- have been reported across Scotland since Saturday.The data shows , new tests were carried out #  .% of these were positive and six new Covid-related deaths have been recorded in the past day.There are , Covid patients in hospital and  in intensive care.The latest vaccine update from the Scottish Government shows , people have received the first dose of the Covid vaccination and , have received their second dose.Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts\" title\"#Covid vaccine in Scotland: Track the rollout progress with these charts# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp covid-vaccine-in-scotland-track-the-rollout-progress-with-these-charts embed # secretQTtiJvtX\" data-secret\"QTtiJvtX\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"The Tele is Dundee Born and Read, and is committed to providing news to our communities.Right now that’s more important than ever, which is why our key content is free.You can chose to support us and access premium content by subscribing to the Eveningfrom just £. a month.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest"},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.51286402-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.51286402-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.51286402-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2021/01/2.51286402-240x180.jpg 300w sizes=(max-width: 940px) 940w, 620w, 300w ","title":"dog groomer unable to pay herself a wage after lack of coronavirus lockdown support","story":"An Angus dog groomer says she has been left wondering how to pay next month’s rent after being unable to get any government financial support.

We watched the last couple of Scotland games and they have been decent.“But in my opinion, that’s what they need — a targetman.“They have got a couple in the pecking order, but I don’t see why Fraser can’t make that step up in the next couple of years.“I’ve played with him for Scotland for two years now and he’s a great player. He can do both sides. He’s a big target man and a strong boy, but he’s technically very good and his awareness is fantastic.“When we’re training I just try and kick him!“We all know he’s a high-class player. He wouldn’t have played for Everton’s first teamhe wasn’t.”If Hornby completes his move to Aberdeen before the transfer window closes at midnight on Monday, the attacker will be teaming up with a few familiar faces.The striker already knows Connor McLennan, Lewis Ferguson and Ross McCrorie from his time with the under-s, while Dons winger Matty Kennedy was an Everton player when Hornby moved to the Blues in .For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"heathers treks from castle dounie to serpentine ridges","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

She has travelled and trekked throughout the world but now lives in Argyll amongst the scenery she loves. www.heatheryheightsDuring wintry weather and shorter days it can be tricky fitting in longer walks and time for exploring the outdoors.What is fantastic about Knapdale and Kintyre is that we only have to go a short distance to gain truly spectacular views. The three walks in this edition y from relatively short, using tracks and paths to the lovely viewpoint of Castle Dounie, to challenging, where the terrain is tough underfoot and good route finding skills are required. All three start at Crinan harbour before climbing up through oak and birch woods to gain open vistas with views to Jura, Scarba and Mull. The convoluted ridge walks are rugged and wild, the steep sides sweeping down to the Sound of Jura where tides race and swirl. If you are lucky you may see pods of dolphins or even whales.. At the car park a signboard shows the Crinan Trail. This is the shorter of the routes but all three start and finish together. Leave the car park and turn left. Keeping to the road by the shore you will see a trail marker post ahead leading you briefly along the shore before the path heads into oak woods. After m the path bends sharply left. To the right a faint trail heads west towards the Sailor’s Grave but your route starts its steep muddy ascent to the forestry road above.. On reaching the road turn right, after m you will reach a bench and the first junction to your left. Here you have a choice either come back from the track ahead or to your left. All routes can be undertaken in either direction. I suggest for the longer routes you go straight on and for the Crinan Trail you go left.. For the Crinan Trail follow the waymark posts and arrows. After .km the route turns right onto a path and winds up and down with glimpses of views to come. Turn left at a sign for a viewpoint. This will take you up to the knoll atop which the remains of Castle Dounie, a prehistoric dun, command spectacular views over the sound towards the Gulf of Corryvreckan. There it is said the Cailleach Bheur, a giant witch, once washed her plaid in its whirlpools. Enjoy the vista before ing down to the junction and turn left. The path now meanders down to the forestry road. Turn right and head north round the coast above Adnoe Point and back to your path down to Crinan harbour.. For the longer walks, go straight ahead at the bench . Follow the track for nearly km, which leads you round a couple of hairpin bends and above Adnoe Point, before turning south. Keep your eyes open for the waymark posts and turn left onto a path. Head uphill for m. At the viewpoint sign turn right up to Castle Dounie and enjoy. To your south is the ridge that leads to Creag Mhor.. Immediately after dropping from Castle Dounie you will see a broken down wall on your right. Follow this for a short distance until you can start to work your way up onto the ridge to your right, by a couple of birch trees with coners on the skyline above. The ridge walk is convoluted, airy, rough and summits numerous lumps and bumps with fantastic views. Keep to the crest or east side as the drop-offs to the west are impressive but not to be dallied with. The highest rocky bump of Creag Mhor is parallel to the north end of the rocks offshore.. After  minutes of knobbly and exposed ridge walking #you do not fancy tackling navigation along walls in woods # this is now the time to keep an eye out for an obvious wide firebreakin the trees, below to your left. This leads you at a ° angle straight to a forestry track in the valley below. To check you have the right point look across from the firebreak and you should see a wall continue the line on the other side. Head down the firebreak to the track and turn left. This will take you back to the junction by the bench where you can turn right on the forest road then left todown the path to Crinan harbour.. If you wish to adventure on* and are confident with your route finding then continue south on the ridge # crossing over an old wall not on the map # to where it suddenly drops to a tiny col with forest directly ahead. Ahead is a steep little rise with walls on it. One drops to the right but it is the one going southwest into the forest you need to follow, for the next m. Keeping the wall directly on your right, circumnavigating the odd boulder and ducking the odd branch, you will see that the deer have created quite a path and that the way is often clear. Eventually it drops you very steeply down to a stream with another wall directly ahead. Turn left, southeast, up the stream with the wall on your right # it is boggy # until you reach a quaint waterfall on your left. A small break in the wall to your right allows you to escape the trees that have fallen across the wall higher up. Continue with it on your left across a tree harvested area and up the bump ahead. You will pop out onto a track end.. Follow this short track down to the forest road below. Turn right and almost immediately turn left onto a grassy track that crosses a stream and heads east up into the forest. After m you will come to a sharp left-hand bend. Directly in front of you a wall goes steeply up into the trees. This is your route up to Bealach na Moine. It leads up slippery, mossy rock for m, over a barbed wired fence , up a very rough and eroded track for nearly m, past a spring hidden with fallen trees, then over more pleasant grass and moss to the col. This last section makes you realise why it is worth the effort as views open up east and west. Turn right over a couple of steep little hillocks on the ridge. Suddenly ahead you will see your goal, the trig point and the summit of Cnoc Reamhar, also known as Gallachoille Hill and a Marilyn to boot. It really is a fantastic view.. Toeither descend the way you came or drop down from one of the breaks in the ridge to the north end of the small lochan on the west side of the summit, and follow the faint Landover track north to the spring. Re-join your ascent route, taking care on the way down. Turn rightat the forest road it is now an easy km back to the junction with the bench. Turn right then left after m, following the path back to Crinan harbour.*You can also drop down the firebreak and turn right on the track to join the route up to Cnoc Reamhar,continuing along the ridge does not appeal.The described routes and accompanying information are there to be used as a guide and do not replace the use of map and compass and the skills required to use them.

The sector in Scotland accounts for around  per cent of UK production and is worth about £ million annually.One fth of these exports go to the EU, amounting to more than , tonnes a year.This is clearly a disastrous Brexit outcome for Scottish farmers and like all other aspects of Brexit, foisted on Scotland against its will.A terrible negotiating failure on the part of the Tory government, and a devastating blow to an extremely valuable part of Scotland’s farming industry, I am sure it will not be the first damaging impact to be highlighted once the deal is fully analysed.Alex Orr, EdinburghSir,The report on the Piers and Harbours Asset Management Plan and Fees and Charges –  , submitted to the Argyll and Bute Council Harbour Board meeting of December ,  makes interesting reading.At a time when budgets are tight and councils have had to make hard decisions about where to cut services, it is dficult to understand why the council budget should be used to supplement the funding of dedicated ferry infrastructure for which CMAL should be responsible.The asset management plan allocates £,, for planned marine infrastructure works for the year  , of which only £, , is devoted to multi-use facilities. The remainder, £,,, is mostly allocated to single-use ferry facilities, and a huge proportion of that is to provide overnight parking for CalMac ferriesreaders will have to make up their own minds about the merits of spending £,, for an overnight berth at Fionnphort, and £, on a feasibility study for a breakwater at Lismore.CMAL pay back around half of the £,, to the council through harbour dues for the use of council-owned piers, however, that still leaves a whopping £ million gap in the required funding.If past experience of other CMAL projects is anything to go by, the planned eight per cent increase in council harbour fees and charges up to   is not going to cover it.Fergus Gillanders, KilmelfordSir,Last year, , was challenging and, although many people like to give generously to charity at Christmas time, it may have been dficult to make a donation this festive season.It#s not too late # you can still help support the Royal National Institute of Blind Peopleby collecting and donating used stamps from cards and parcels you may have received.Your stamps will be recycled and turned into vital funds that will help RNIB support children with vision impairment.

Some do exist, however, and while not attempting to be a comprehensive history, there is a nicely illustrated booklet about the hospital and its past entitled #Up The Brae#, produced a few years ago by Brenda Bratt, Jess Grant and my former colleague Dr Grace Fergusson .These photographs are a reminder of the loss of a signicant social and economic element in the fabric of Mid Argyll, where for generations it would have been dficult to find a family without some connection to #the AB#. For those who worked there, myself included, any sadness however is much more about the loss of a self-sufficient and widely respected mental health service.I was a late participant in the story of the AB, being appointed physician superintendent in , a post I held in addition to that of clinical director for mental health services for Argyll and Bute and West Dunbartonshire until , and I feel a duty to the many splendid colleagues with whom I worked to comment on the loss of the service in which the AB served as the nucleus.During the course of   the hospital was awarded the accolade #Best Mental Illness Hospital in Britain# as the result of a national competition launched by the King’s Fund and sponsored by the Sunday Times. This was a recognition of the multi-disciplinary spirit and enthusiasm for innovation that characterised the service, and the ethos of best clinical practice being led by academic excellence. The service went on to be recognised as a centre of excellence by many visiting accreditation bodies.My reason for making these points has nothing to do with nostalgia.The past has no utility in the present or the future except as a source for learning how best to proceed.The ingredients for a good mental health service are the same today as they were in  and they have little to do with buildings or even location. Staff have to feel they #belong# to something there must be a collegiate spirit binding together the ious disciplines shared professional development and peer support and clear lines of accountability. It is frankly hard to see any such features in the current delivery of mental health care.Someone once said #psychiatry isn’t sexy#, meaning that in any competition for resources with other clinical specialities, psychiatry will always lose, and so to get the best out of the NHS for folk with psychiatric disorder, exceptional effort is required. The achievements and values of the past can act as a springboard for such effort, but here they seem to have been squandered by a distant and disinterested health board.It is all too easy to avoid investing in a service by reorganising it into invisibility, but the people who pay the cost are those who deserve the best of specialist professional help.So I am certainly sad at the disappearance of the old AB, because it is symbolic of something having been lost that is much more important than stones and mortar.Professor Angus Mackay OBE FRCPsych, ArdrishaigSir,Scots have taken to online technology like never before to keep in touch during this dficult time.When we first went into lockdown, there were concerns over whether our networks would cope with this big increase in online traffic. But though customers# usage of data more than doubled, our networks were able to stand up to the demands.I’m immensely proud of the role my colleagues have played in keeping the country connected during this crisis. From the engineers who keep our broadband and mobile networks connected, to the vital contact centre staff in Glasgow, Dundee, Greenock, Edinburgh and Thurso, helping people when they need it most.I’m also proud of the role our people played in supporting the NHS in Scotland during the crisis, including working with Scottish Government to quickly provide communications to the temporary hospitals.The pandemic has shown the vital role digital technology and internet connectivity now plays in all our lives. If all homes and businesses are going to stay ahead, we know that fast and reliable broadband and good mobile coverage is going to be essential for the post-Covid recovery.We#ll continue to work with governments and local authorities to make sure that no areas are left behind.Jane Wood, BT Group Scotland Director, Alexander Graham Bell House, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 8 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

This is ridiculous. I have attended  years of meetings on the A and all we get is fobbed off with pathetic excuses.We need a government which will deliver results, not spend all its time plotting to get independence while ignoring the real issues like a closed A which blight people#s lives.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,As we move into  and parents, teachers and pupils once again find themselves facing additional challenges to deliver and attain a full and rounded education, it is worthwhile remembering the role that music can and should play in improving our lives.Firstly, music will help to support and sustain our young people through the coming months. For children and adults alike, the creative arts play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and positive mental health, providing both a means of expression during the isolation of #lockdown# and a practical as well as enjoyable pastime.Secondly # and just as importantly # playing an instrument is complementary to academic subjects and has been shown emphatically to improve wider educational success. As we consider the often daunting challenge of theto home schooling, those parents whose children can mix domestic timetables with musical lessons will understand the release and stimulation playing an instrument can deliver.Across society music is integral to our identities and is made to be shared. We now have the means to do that successfully and safely with online tools whose use has been well-honed by recent experience.So whether you#re at the start of a musical journey, or are well advanced in music-making let#s keep singing, keep dancing and keep music lessons flowing, particularly while the restrictions necessitated by the pandemic keep us apart in our own homes.Dr Kenneth Taylor, head teacher, St Mary’s Music School, EdinburghSir,As Scotland faces a second national lockdown, the country#s national walking charity, Paths for All, is encouraging the public to explore local walking routes in a bid to help combat social isolation, anxiety and loneliness while maintaining physical health.The call follows the launch of the charity#s Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, which asks people to make the pledge of walking every day throughout January.The campaign includes an online hub which outlines the importance of walking and regular physical activity during the winter months. A iety of activities and ideas, designed to motivate iniduals of all ages, are available on the hub with podcast recommendations, creative walking advice and prize incentives.In what is traditionally the time of year which sees a surge of gym memberships and fitness plans we suggest taking up walking instead as part of our new year resolutions.With walking being one of the few essential reasons for leaving your home, it is the perfect exercise and now is the time to get into a walking exercise routine which is consistent with the current government guidelines. Walking can help with our social health as the guidelines allow us to meet with one person from one other household outside.Last year we saw an increase in Scots taking up walking during the first lockdown and the outcome has highlighted just how many benefits are attributed to walking and how outdoor exercise as many times a day as we can has become an important way to look after physical and mental wellbeing.Follow the campaign over on Paths for All social media channels #WalkOnceADay.For more information on the Walk Once a Day this Winter campaign, visit the Paths for All website.Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer, Paths for AllSir,The New Year is usually a time for a fresh start – making resolutions, getting fit, setting new challenges and goals. But with the continuing uncertainty caused by the COVID- pandemic, it seems harder to commit to making a change.With restrictions ongoing, it’s becoming even more important for us to find new and innovative ways to raise vital funds for NSPCC Scotland to help children at risk of abuse and neglect.Children have been greatly affected by the pandemic. Since the first lockdown measures were introduced, the average monthly number of referrals from the NSPCC’s helpline to agencies in Scotland, such as the police or children’s services, have been more than  per cent higher than the first three months of . And the effects are far from over.Even with social distancing, there are still many ways you can fundraise for us.From hosting a virtual quiz or coffee morning to selling handmade crafts, cakes or old clothes, we’ve got lots of great virtual fundraising ideas you can try while following the Scottish Government#s advice on social distancing.By volunteering just a couple of hours each month to fundraise in your  area, you can help to make  a better year for children.So please think about using your new year passion and enthusiasm to come up with some ideas to fundraise and help us be there when children need us most.To find out more or to request your fundraising pack, visit www.nspcc.org.uk or contact jen.lindsay@nspcc.org.uk by email.Jen Lindsay, community fundraising manager, NSPCC Scotland"},{"url":null,"title":"boaters urged to abide by covid rules","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The revised guidance recognises that travel is severely restricted by law and owners may only travel to their boatit is kept in the same local authority area they live in.RYA Scotland, Sail Scotland and British Marine Scotland have joined together to encourage boat owners to use the services of staff where their boat is stored,at all possible, in an effort to avoid making a journey, to respect that storage providers may not be able to open and to advise owners to contact providers before travelling to confirm access.The information is tailored towards RYA affiliated clubs and recognised training centres as well as inidual members and the wider boating community across Scotland.James Allan, chief executive officer at RYA Scotland, said: #Lockdown will be disappointing for everyone, but it is still possible to go boating as a form of exercise and spending some time afloat or near the water is great for our wellbeing. It is important to remember we are in the grip of a pandemic that has become signicantly worse in recent weeks. The overriding message for Scotland’s boating community is to stay at home wherever possible as we must all help stop the spread of the virus.#Importantly in this lockdown, owners may travel within their local authority to undertake essential maintenance on their boat but may not stay longer than theof time required to undertake essential maintenance.To check what level of measures apply in your area or venue where you intend to participate in activity, please check the postcode on the Scottish Government webpage.In the meantime, RYA Scotland has decided to postpone its directly organised, non-virtual events and training in response to these measures to protect participants, volunteers and others and to reduce the risk of placing an additional burden on the emergency services at what is a hugely testing time.The RYA will be providing a range of online events and #SailFromHome activities.

In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark, which is grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British.

Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal wardSir,In order to avoid fishermen being adversely impacted by export delays, Scottish Conservatives leader Douglas Ross has called on the UK Government to bring forward compensation to the affected fishermen and deliver it immediately.The SNP government must also accept responsibility and deal with ongoing issues involving their agency, Food Standards Scotland, which are holding up exports within Scotland.Both of Scotland’s governments must work together to deliver for Scottish fishermen.We in the Scottish Conservatives will back Scotland’s fishing communities all the way.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward Sir,The Scottish SPCA is appealing to animal lovers in Scotland to donate much-needed food to its National Wildle Rescue Centre in Fishcross, Alloa.Scotland#s animal welfare charity had its busiest ever year in  with over , wildle casualties admitted.The pandemic caused quite a signicant drop in the number of animals arriving at the wildle hospital. Over , wild animals were brought to the centre in .As we are entering fox cub season, we are appealing for Pedigree puppy food and puppy milk.Last year, we cared for  foxes, of which  were cubs. It can be a struggle to keep up with so many hungry mouths to feed.We expect to be even busier with admissions this year so we need help from members of the public.If anyone can help with food for these young mammals, we would appreciate anything that people can spare.Puppy meat can be purchased from the wildle centre#s Amazon wishlist http:amzn.to xkUe.Steven Gray Scottish SPCA National Wildle Rescue Centre managerSir,New Year resolutions can be a good starting point for making longer term health and lestyle improvements, but most people do not stick to them. Reasons for quitting include a lack of time, a lack of support from other people and feeling daunted by unrealistic targets.Often, goals are unachievable because they are too dficult, or they do not allow enough time for you to make gradual changes.There is nothing wrong with aiming high and being ambitious, but it is important that your goal is not too dficult or time-consuming as this could leave you feeling daunted.Ask yourself the following questions: Is the goal too ambitious  Is the timeframe realistic  What specic changes do I need to make  Can I fit my new healthy behaviour around my other commitments Breaking large goals down into smaller goals can make them feel more achievable and less daunting.For example,you are aiming to lose weight, the NHS recommends that you aim to lose around  to lbsa week. You should be able to achieve this by cutting down your calorie intake by about  to  calories each day. It might take longer than planned to lose the weight, but you are more likely to stick to it and not give up.Plan how you will achieve your goal and what changes you will make to ensure you stick to it. There are online resources available to help you plan your healthy activities, such as the NHS couch to km programme or the NHS programmes for stopping smoking, cutting down alcohol and losing weight.Try to be patient and don’t expect the results from just one or two weeks of dieting to show on the weighing scales, as it may take longer.A good way to motivate you is to involve other people. If you know someone who has a similar goal to yours, try to involve them as a #buddy# to provide mutual support.They may even be able to push you a little bit harder, helping you to achieve your goals sooner. Look for groups on social media who share your goal.If you miss a fitness session or have an alcoholic drink, cigarette or bar of chocolate, try not to feel guilty. Think about what might have triggered the deviation from your goal and try to avoid it in future. Forgive yourself and aim to get back to achieving your goal as soon as possible.On average, it takes between  and  days for something to become a long-term habit. Make goals that you want to be able to stick to long term, such as improving your overall fitness, stopping smoking or maintaining your weight.If you can make it through these first few weeks, you will notice that things will become much easier.Dr Helen Flaherty, head of health promotion and education, Heart Research UK"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 22 2021","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

We can set up a chat within  hours and the service can be used as many times as needed.James Adams, director, Royal National Institute of Blind People Scotland, EdinburghDear Alister,In the weeks since the UK left the European Union, I have been contacted by numerous Argyll and Bute residents and businesses who share my very deep concerns about the future sustainability and, indeed, the survival of our vital shellfish and fishing sector.The seafood sector is a vital component of our already-fragile regional economy and is now hit by the inability, virtually overnight, for producers and processors to get their time-sensitive products to market or to customers.If allowed to go unresolved, this sector is likely to disappear, badly affecting Argyll and Bute’s overall recovery and future growth.Fish and shellfish from Argyll and Bute are high quality products of international renown.The industry has been a mainstay and a major employer in the area for many decades, sustaining not only the local economy but making a signicant contribution to the Scottish and UK economies.I am now hearing from long-standing fishing families, newer start-up businesses and companies employing hundreds of people that,urgent action is not taken, they will have to close their doors for good.This would be devastating for Argyll and Bute, where the sector comprises many single-family operated vessels, smaller fleets and artisan producers as well as some medium to larger enterprises.As a council we are doing all that we can to support these businesses and prevent this imminent disaster.Our officers are working behind the scenes to assist and are in constant discussions with the Scottish Government to reiterate the critical need for the commercial hubs to operate smoothly, ensuring that the right processes are in place to help businesses get their goods to their customers.We are also speaking to Argyll and Bute producers to help them navigate these new processes and to issue all the necessary paperwork where appropriate, so that these valuable products reach buyers.Delays on both sides of the border have already seen valuable products being lost, together with valued customers who are seeking their produce where.Very urgent action and assistance is needed now from your government in order to prevent this traditional Scottish industry sector from disappearing altogether.Most urgently of all, getting products to market must be streamlined, simplied and speeded up.These products need to be prioritised over products with longer shelf lives –the situation is allowed to persist then very many companies will have no choice but to give up, costing jobs and much-needed revenue to the treasury.In addition to improving processes and the speed of delivery here in the UK, these businesses, so vital to Argyll and Bute and Scotland’s economic recovery and future success, need your government to negotiate urgently with its counterparts in Europe to identy and resolve the delays in allowing fresh goods to arrive in and then to progress on to customers.I cannot state strongly enough that these actions are needed now. More is required, though, in the medium and longer terms, to help this beleaguered industry to get afloat again and regain some buoyancy.Producers and customers need reassurance that future supplies will be prioritised and to regain confidence in the industry through dedicated marketing and investment where possible through the £m fisheries fund your government announced following the publication of the agreement.Our seafood sector desperately needs Government to take action to secure its survival. Please do what you can, urgently, to avoid its demise.Robin Currie, Argyll and Bute Council leader"},{"url":null,"title":"innerleithen-golfer-83-celebrates-first-hole-in-one","story":"AN -YEAR-OLD

Thatrsquos because it helps build up your immune system. Vitamin C is thought to increase the production of white blood cells. These are key to fighting infections.Popular citrus fruits include grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, lemons, limesand clementines.ZincldquoZinc is necessary for a healthy immune system,\" according toMelissa Snover, founder and CEO of Nourished.\"A lack of zinc can make a person more susceptible to disease and illness.\"This essential nutrient helps maintain the bodyrsquos ability to make new cells and enzymes, process carbohydrate, fat and protein in food and also increases the speed of healing muscles and wounds.\"Foods high in zinc include red meat, shellfish, eggs, nuts, wholegrainsand legumes, such as chickpeas, lentilsand beans.BroccoliBroccoli is supercharged with vitamins and minerals. Packed with vitamins A, C, and E, as well as many other antioxidants and fibre, broccoli is one of the healthiest vegetables you can put on your table. The key to keeping its power intact is to cook it as little as possible - or better yet, not at all.GingerGinger is another ingredient many turn to when they are feeling under the weather. The antioxidant is believed to fight off cold and flu symptoms, combat nausea, and is full of iron, zinc, calcium and magnesium.However, itrsquos worth noting that a study from  showed fresh ginger may help boost the bodyrsquos respiratory system, but dry ginger did not show the same results.GarlicBefore it became a staple in cooking, garlic was actually used for medicinal purposes. From manganese to vitamin B and C, as well as selenium and fibre, it is high in immune-boosting compounds.\"Garlic is a potent anti-viral, anti-fungal agent, and eating it raw, or as an uncooked puree alongside your normal foodwill wipe-out most miscreants,\" Sara Davenport, health expert and author of Reboot Your Health told the .YogurtLook for yogurts that have live and active cultures printed on the label, like Greek yogurt. These cultures may stimulate your immune system to help fight diseases.According to Healthline, yogurt can also be a great source of vitamin D, so try to select brands fortied with vitamin D. Vitamin D helps regulate the immune system and is thought to boost our bodyrsquos natural defences against diseases.Sunflower seedsSunflower seeds are full of nutrients, including phosphorus, magnesium, and vitamin B. Theyrsquore also incredibly high in vitamin E, a powerful antioxidant.Vitamin E is important in regulating and maintaining immune system . Other foods with high amounts of vitamin E include avocadosand dark leafy greens.Mushrooms\"There are approximately  species of fungi that have been identied with medicinal properties, and many have antiviral, antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory qualities,\" says Euan MacLennan, herbal director at Pukka Herbs and medical herbalist at an NHS practice in London.\"Mushrooms are high in beta glucans ndash natural substances found to help prime our immune system, making sure itrsquos ready for action to fight off infection.\"Red peppersAccording to Healthline, red peppers contain twice as much vitamin C as citrus.

He says it should be capable of tracking and verying an iniduals vaccine status across the world.It could, according to Blair, involve not only how many vaccinations someone has had , but also any test results they may have had in the past.It is hoped that the data would be transferred using a QR code, which would be scanned by participating countries at borders and ports.Will vaccine passports be introduced in Scotland In evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Covid- Committee on Thursday, Professor Leitch said coronavirus is likely to be present in some sort of ldquoendemic form for years to come.When he was asked about vaccine passports, hesaid: ldquoI agree it is an interesting concept, the WHOhave begun to look at it.He stressed the latest scientic evidence suggests vaccination is not a ldquobinary state, but there is precedent for travel restrictions based on vaccination ndash including yellow fever certicates.Prof Leitch said: ldquoI think we will probably move towards that. I havenrsquot seen the exact details of what Mr Blairrsquos think tank have said but I imagine itrsquos relatively sensible, itrsquos about doing it globally rather than just an inidual region of the world.What are others across the world saying Zurab Pololikashvili, the UN World Tourism Organisationrsquos secretary-general, last week told the Global Tourism Crisis Committee in Madrid: ldquoVaccines must be part of a wider, coordinated approach that includes certicates and passes for safe cross-border travel.The leaders of Spain, Italy, Greece, Cyprus and Malta have called for the

MPs she can see the benefit of Covid- immunity passports, but warned they came with privacy concerns.Information commissioner Elizabeth Denham was asked by MPs on the Digital, Culture, Media and Sportsub-committee on Online Harms and Disinformation about the possible use of special passports to allow those who had been vaccinated to move more freely.She said any such scheme would face substantial questions over its necessity and concerns over the sharing of health data, but warned of creating a ldquotwo-tier system where people who have received a vaccine have more freedoms than

It is stating the obvious, I know, but as we live through another lockdown, it is tempting to focus on the liberties lost and freedoms curtailed, when there are many good things still to celebrate.Not least of these is hope, another word that is used a lot in these days. We hope the vaccines will make a dference we hope things will get better we hope our children will get back to school we hope the planet can be brought back into balance we hope.But where is the ground for hope  Science and human skill A talk on the radio a few weeks ago, before Christmas, spoke about gts, and posed the question that the vaccines that have been developed might be God’s gt to humanity this Christmas, and the skills of the scientists ultimately come from God.Because for people of faith, the ultimate hope is in the God who is the source of le and who Christians believe came to earth in Jesus to show us the way forward.#For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son…# John :Where is our ground for hope  Surely the power of love is our only hope, the steadfast love of the Lord who #never leaves us nor forsakes us#and is with us every step of the way.Just be glad you have a glass.Reverend Steve Fulcher,"},{"url":null,"title":"sponsors kit out young pupils players","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

The problem is, Smithy, a teacher#s nightmare, causes so much chaos that the head teacher ends up on a le support machine.Enter Dr Hannibal Lecture, the replacement head, and the stage is set for a war of nerves. The musical is on next Thursday, Friday and Saturday, with the curtain going up at .pm.West Coast Motors will be extending its local town service to include the school on the three nights of the production.FIFTY YEARS AGOPaul abroadWhile the financial problems of the Beatles are being investigated in London, Paul McCartney is believed to be in America. He left his farm, High Park, on January , after celebrating the New Year there with his we and children.Visit on # but support is neededConfirmation has been received from the mayor of the French village of Montbeliard that a party of Campbeltonians will be welcome at the village#s music festival on July - this year.Provost Dan McKinven told the Courier: #I now propose to call a meeting within the Town Council Chambers of all interested in taking part. I would expect representation from pipers, Highland and Scottish country dancers, choirs and pop groups. Any inidual performer would also be welcome as a cross-section of our community and its talent is essential.#The present plan is to travel directly from Campbeltown to Montbeliard by luxury coach. The village is about km from the Swiss border and the city of Basel.Provost McKinven added: #We would expect to form a committee which would be responsible for organising the finance and travel arrangements for about  people inclusive of press, photographer and artists.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOTwo boys birchedAt a children#s court last Friday – Sherf McMaster Campbell on the bench – two boys were charged with the theft of purses containing money from a house in Burn Road. The crime was admitted.The boys, it appeared, were messengers, and the younger one was in the habit of calling at the house in this capacity daily. The purses were taken on separate days. On the first occasion a purse containing £ s d had been left lying on a small table near the window of one of the rooms. The window was probably partially open. After the younger boy#s visit in the afternoon it was missed.Next day a purse containing s d was left in the same position, and on the boy calling at the house, the occupier challenged him with the theft. He admitted taking the purse and handed it over to the owner. Only  shillings of the  shillings and sixpence remained in the purse.While this interview was going on at the back door of the residence, the older boy, who accompanied the other on the second occasion, appeared to have devoted his attention to the room where the first purse was got, and he possessed himself of the second purse and its contents. His lordship sentenced each of the culprits to receive seven strokes with the birch rod."},{"url":null,"title":"letters january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I see Loch Fyne langoustines are sent to the EU but, living fairly close to Loch Fyne, I don#t seem to be able to purchase the product locally.I am sure UK supermarkets would be only too happy to sell, crabs, lobsters and langoustines provided by Scottish fishermen but it seems they would prefer to supply the EU rather than the home market.Fishing boats enter Campbeltown Loch regularly but there is no local supply of their catch as this is transported #up the road# as soon as it is landed.I just suggest that supplying the UK market is maybe a way out of the continual problems with our #friendly# neighbours who seem hell bent on putting continual obstacles in the way of sensible trading partnerships.Keith Abendroth, Campbeltown.I grew up in Peninver and have been hiking on the hills around the Rest and Be Thankful many times, all year round. My initial thought a few years ago was that the best solution to the problem of landslides on the Rest was building avalanche tunnels like there are on the A at Lochcarron but there is practically zero ground to build on on the downhill side of the A.The big catch-pits along the uphill side of the road do seem to work but, in the long-term, removing the unstable soil and planting lots of trees and shrubs on the rest of the hillside to hold it in place, might be the best solution.Rather than replace the road through the Rest and Be Thankful with a new route through another glen or to continue trying to stop an unstable hillside from obeying the laws of gravity, how much would it cost to remove all the soil in these watercourses which regularly slide Maybe cost-wise removing the unstable soil from the Rest would be cheaper # and quicker  # than building a whole new road If there is a landslide in a watercourse, it weakens the soil directly above it so that will slide next, followed by the soil above it, etc. The bedrock at the Rest is only a couple of feet below the surface so removing the soil in gullies liable to slide after rain might be a lot cheaper than building a new road through another glen.For a permanent solution, perhaps close off the road from Ardgartan to the Lochgoilhead junction for six months in the winter, pipe water from Loch Restil to the top of the gullies prone to sliding # at the base of the first exposed bedrock high up the gullies # let the water run for three or four months, and hydraulically remove all the loose soil, then in the spring shovel all the accumulated debris of the other side of the road It would mean short-term inconvenience for a lot of people but it might save a lot of money, time, and perhaps lives, in the long-term.Harry Hood, New Hampshire, USA. As children and young peopleto being home-schooled due to the new lockdown, there is no doubt that this will have a continued detrimental impact on mental health and wellbeing.As a coalition, we applaud the Scottish Government’s greater investment in mental health services. However, a view we share with other organisations, is that this investment is simply not sufficient.Mental health services were already under immense strain prior to Covid-, with children waiting considerable s of time for support. Recent statistics from December, for example, point to the fact that more than , children have been waiting over a year for treatment.This pandemic will only serve to make matters even worse as services deal with a backlog of those already suffering from mental health problems, added to which will be those who have developed problems over the course of lockdown.What is needed is a national crusade, delivering signicant investment in the public, private and third sectors to deliver adequate mental health support, both during and as we recover from Covid-. We must also use this as an opportunity to radically transform our mental health services, both for now and for the future, refocusing on prevention and early intervention.In the meantime, we would urge those children and their families who feel they need help not to hold back and look to get the support they need.The Scottish Children’s Services Coalition: Kenny Graham, Falkland House School Lynn Bell, LOVE Learning Stephen McGhee, Spark of Genius Niall Kelly, Young Foundations.The serious neurological condition Myalgic Encephalomylitiswill sadly be all too familiar to some of your readers at least , children and adults in Scotland live with ME, also diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome .Many face barriers in accessing health and social care services that meet their needs, and some professionals still don’t understand the impact of ME and its symptoms.UK charity Action for ME is trying to change this by offering people with ME across Scotland one-to-one advocacy, via phone and email, to help them be heard, understand their rights and access support.We want to expand this much-needed service, and are seeking enthusiastic volunteers in Scotland who can make the most of our online advocate training programme to develop their skills, gain valuable experience, and help improve the lives of vulnerable people with ME, all from home.Anyone who is interested in finding out more can call , emailor visit our website– we would love to hear from good listeners who can spare two hours a week.Alice Cranston, advocacy coordinator, Action for ME."},{"url":null,"title":"mark beaumont goes the extra mile for marys meals","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It’s a fantastic way to get more active and also help feed hungry children in the world’s poorest communities.#Funds raised will allow Mary’s Meals to provide hungry children in some of the world’s poorest areas with a nutritious daily meal. The promise of food attracts impoverished children to the classroom, where they can gain an education that will one day hopefully be their ladder out of poverty.And thanks to Double the Love, donations made will go twice as far. Give until January , and the UK government with match public donations to the charity, up to £ million.Gillian McMahon, director of supporter engagement at Mary’s Meals, said: #Whether it’s doing your regular run, getting on your bike or upping your daily step count, we hope that lots of people will get moving and take part in Miles For Mary’s Meals.#Those taking part in Miles For Mary’s Meals are asked to ensure that they participate in their chosen exercise challenge safely and in line with Covid- restrictions in their local area.To find out more about organising your own Miles For Mary’s Meals fundraiser, visit marysmeals.org.uk"},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I’m anticipating an end to the pandemic – coming out of the gloom. And there have been many episodes in le in which I’ve lived in the hope of emerging through the other side of the dark night. I thank God for the hope he gives me. But, how do we know when the darkness of night has ended In a rabbinic school, a very old rabbi posed a clever question to his young students: #When can it be said that night truly ends and the day begins  When is that moment when from darkness there comes light, when it can really be said the gloom has passed and brightness is here #The first student, still a bit immature, replied: #Well, it’s when it says so on the internet.#The rabbi smiled and told him: #That’s not what I mean.#The next student said: #It’s when you can distinguish sheep from goats, because in the dark they look very similar, but when light appears they can be told apart.#The rabbi told him it was a wiser answer, but not the one.The third student said: #When you can tell the fig tree and palm tree apart.#This interested the rabbi, but, no, this wasn’t it. The rabbi askedthere were any other ideas, but there weren’t. So he told them the answer: #It is when you look at another person and do not see a stranger but a brother or sister this is when know the night has ended and the day begins.#Father Tony Wood, Saint Kieran#s Catholic Church, Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday january 22 2021","story":"Hannah OHanlonUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +viaYOURTWITTERNAMEHERE\" title\"Tweet this\"TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

After nearly a year of people taking exercise and essential journeys on foot during Covid- lockdowns, plans to keep the nation walking are more important than ever.#The increases in people walking, has highlighted the lack of good infrastructure to support safe and enjoyable travel by foot. Communities that lack local facilities within walking distance have had challenges. That’s why we are calling for investment in everyday walking to build back better after the pandemic, and respond to the challenges of air pollution, climate change and Scotland#s health record.#Ian Findlay CBE, chief officer of Paths for All, said: #We launch our manesto at a crucial point of change for Scotland as we begin to plan for le after Covid-. During lockdown, we have seen a rise in the number of people walking as many used it as a way to cope with the pressures of everyday le, to reach essential shops and services in their  area, and to connect with others and nature in a safe way.#But we need to do more to make regular walking an enjoyable and accessible choice for everyone in Scotland, from all walks of le. By investing in walking programmes and safe, attractive places to walk we can signicantly improve the nation’s health, reducing health inequalities and pressure on our NHS.#Brendan Paddy, director of Ramblers Scotland, said: #Our joint manesto makes a compelling case for investment to make walking safe and attractive for everyone in Scotland.#We believe walking can play a vital role in Scotland’s response to the challenges of Covid- and climate change # and the obesity, bioersity and mental health crises we face. Booming numbers are enjoying the outdoors in the Covid era and we need to support these people to continue to get all the health and wellbeing benefits of outdoor recreation for years to come.#"},{"url":null,"title":"why your business must act now to continue trading with europe","story":"Wyvex MediaUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

It will be aired on March  at pm.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOPressure piled on for quick Irish ferry decisionPressure was growing earlier this week on the Scottish Secretary to give Caledonian MacBrayne the go-ahead to operate the proposed ferry link between Campbeltown and Ballycastle in Northern Ireland.Scottish Office officials are said to oppose state-owned CalMac’s participation in the project.But earlier this week it was revealed they had asked CalMac to submit a business plan for the route. The news was welcomed by the prospective Conservative candidate for Argyll and Bute, Mr Ralph Leishman.He told the Courier: ‘This is a definite step forward and knocks on the head suggestions that the Scottish Office is totally opposed to CalMac as the operator on this route.’Scottish Office reservations are believed to centre on proposals to use the MV Claymore on the route. This would mean £, would have to be spent upgrading another vessel for relief work for its west coast services.They are also said to be concerned that no private firm appeared to be interested in running the service all year-round.CalMac’s participation in the project has been backed by politicians on both sides of the Irish Sea.Both Scottish Secretary Mr Michael Forsyth and Prime Minister Mr John Major were believed this week to have been lobbied at Westminster by CalMac’s supporters.Northern Ireland secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is said to be among those who have contacted Mr Forsyth to support CalMac’s involvement.The project supporters have been asking the Scottish Office to consider the economic benefits the ferry could bring to Ballycastle and Campbeltown, which are both areas of high unemployment. The project is expected to create around  jobs,  of them in Argyll.The only other company which has expressed an interest in running the service, Seacat, only wants to operate it over a four-month summer season.FIFTY YEARS AGOMr Noble ill # so Provost steps in to open new airport terminalThe new passenger terminal at Machrihanish Airport will be opened on Friday at pm by Provost Dan McKinven, in the absence of Mr Michael Noble MP Minister of Trade, through illness.The new building, which has been provided by the Department of Trade and Industry in conjunction with the Ministry of Defence, is a small one situated within a self-contained enclave and is designed to improve the facilities of BEA passengers using Machrihanish.Before the terminal was built, all BEA passengers had to be taken by bus between the aircraft and the old terminal building near the main entrance of the airport, and, latterly, to a dispersal point on the south side.Under the new improvements, BEA aircraft will now taxi directly to the new terminal area, and passengers will be able to walk the short distance from the aircraft to the terminal.A new road traffic control system has also been provided because aircraft taxiing from the runway to the terminal have to cross a public road.The new arrangements have the additional advantage of reducing the distance, and, consequently, the journey time between the airport and Campbeltown.A complete shake-up of BEA Highland services is on the way. It could mean higher fares and smaller planes and the end of the name British European Airways on some routes.Last year the Highlands and Islands routes cost the company more than £,.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOSparks and FlashesThe annual meeting in connection with the Campbeltown Cottage Hospital will be held on Tuesday first at . in the Council Room.Local footballers had again an idle Saturday last week on account of bad weather.

His solution is even more batty.Driven by resentment and sepia-tinted post-Empire English nationalism, cloaked in talk of Britain and the UK, the Tories have jemmied the UK out of the world’s largest and most successful single market.Having placed the UK as a #third country# outside the EU, alongside Somalia and Kazakhstan, it is not the EU to blame for the barriers to free trade, Mr Abendroth, but the UK government and those who parroted the cruel myths of Brexiteer #sunny uplands#.Mr Abendroth suggests that the fishing industry merely sells into the domestic market as a replacement to EU trade, without thought to the timescales required to repurpose supply lines and create a viable home market # evenit could be done fishing businesses would already be bankrupt.Scotland’s economy and the living standards and opportunities of Scots have been thrown under the wheels of England’s red Brexit bus. Never have the consequences of permitting Westminster to rule our country been more stark.But the time is coming when Scotland will have the historic opportunity to regain the huge benefits of EU membership and become a normal, thriving, independent state at the heart of Europe. There is an empty seat at the top table in Europe # and it won’t be empty for long.Ron Wilson, secretary, Kintyre SNP.Remember the closing stages of the Brexit negotiations  Boris Johnson pretended he was holding out to get the best deal for fishermen. In the end he agreed a deal that the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation described as #desperately poor# and #the worst of both worlds#.Fishermen are restricted to catch fewer fish in most key species. Lorries carrying stocks that have been caught were left to sit at Larkhall – unable to penetrate the new fog of bureaucracy. Scottish fishermen are forced to land the fish they can catch in Denmark – grim news for Scottish fish processors.Instead of trying to fix the problem, Tory Minister Jacob Rees-Mogg says the fish are happier to be British. Of course they are – the fishermen aren’t catching them.The Tories must sort out this mess they have created. Our fishermen and fish processing workers deserve better than silly remarks about happy fish.Councillor Alan Reid, Cowal ward.Keith Abendroth is spot on with his call for the fishing industry in Campbeltown to supply the home market.During my three-and-a-half years in the town it was possible to buy directly from the boat on occasion but it was nigh on impossible to buy fresh live lobster in the town#s fish shop.When I was new to the town , I experienced some shocking service at the some of the small retailers who I always endeavour to support. It is easier to get a full range of seafood and fish in Peebles, about  miles from the sea, which has an excellent fish shop supplied from Eyemouth on the East Coast.Much Welsh shellfish is sent by air to Europe. I often wondered why lorries trundled from Campbeltown across the Rest and Be Thankful and all the way to the English Channel crossings.Much of the st century supply chain is a mystery to me. For instance, much Pacic wild salmon is processed in China before being exported to the UK.  It is an excellent alternative to the farmed version at roughly the same price.Surely a town with an airport could develop a sea product freight service or is it simply down to volume, weight and cost Mark Davey, Peebles.Two weeks ago, at Campbeltown Free Church, we received a letter of thanks from Blythswood Care for filling shoeboxes to support the  Shoe Box Appeal.However, we are aware that many who contributed do not belong to Campbeltown Free Church.So, through the pages of the Courier, can I thank them for their kindness towards people they have never met but whose lives have been enriched by their generosity Dr Rodger M Crooks, Campbeltown Free Church minister.Like many, many other residents in Argyll and Bute I have received through the post a bizarre leaflet from the Liberal Democrats. Bizarre, because it promotes a candidate standing in a completely dferent seat # Caithness, Sutherland and Ross.Meanwhile, the good folk of Caithness, Sutherland and Ross have been equally mystied as to why the hapless Lib Dems have sent them leaflets promoting a candidate in Argyll and Bute!The Lib Dems have certainly lost their way when it comes to their policy on the EU # but it seems that they#ve lost their way in Scotland too.Les Wilson, Islay.Earlier this month the Prime Minister announced a third national lockdown. Although necessary, these measures mean many of our veterans will be facing the next several weeks – or months – completely alone.And while the vaccine rollout out across the country provides some hope, social isolation and loneliness poses a real threat to our elderly this winter, among them many former RAF personnel and their partners supported by the fund.To help combat this, last year the RAF Benevolent Fund introduced a weekly Check and Chat service to support members of the RAF Family experiencing loneliness. I speak to one such gentleman every Tuesday. He lives alone and spent much of  totally isolated and, for him, this service truly is a leline. We chat about what he’s been up to, what he’s cooking for tea, to his time in the RAF and often I’m the only person he will speak to for days.The fund also organises weekly telephone friendship groups, provides access to a listening and counselling service, relationship counselling support, and an online wellbeing portal to help support emotional wellbeing amongst the veteran community.Throughout the pandemic, many of us have learnt more about our neighbours and local community. That’s why we are calling on the people of Scotland to consider whether they know any RAF veterans, or their spouses or widows, who may be experiencing loneliness.To refer someone to the RAF Benevolent Fund, please visit rafbf.org or call   .Air Vice-Marshal Chris Elliot, chief executive, RAF Benevolent Fund."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week january 29 2021","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  At the start of the pandemic in March we took the decision to make online access to our news free of charge by taking down our paywall.

I cannot help but think that it bodes well for the future of that great nation to have a man of faith leading it.Returning to the words, some of the finest and most moving that day came from a young woman called Amanda Gorman.She spoke of lting the gaze of the nation not to what stands between its people, but to what stands before them, of closing ides because they know that, to put their future first, they must first put dferences aside.#The new dawn,# she said, #blooms as we free it.

This adaptation means that they are ideally suited to being houseplants, particularly in homes where the owners are forgetful waterers!Succulent is a general description for plants that have tissues adapted to store water but doesnrsquot refer to a specic plant. On the other hand, cactus is a botanical name for plants belonging to the plant family Cactaceae and, for specic physiological reasons, may not always be regarded as succulents.Succulent suggestionsAmongst the toughest, most robust indoor succulents is the sanseveria, a wide range of plants whose common names include mother-in-lawrsquos tongue , snake plantand birds nest plant .With bold, thick, simple leaves, theyrsquore almost sculptural in appearance, tolerant of low light levels and, because they require minimal attention, theyrsquore an obvious choice for those with little or no experience of houseplants.Sanseveria are particularly good at improving the indoor air quality theyrsquore known to remove air pollutants including formaldehyde, xylene and toluene and, because they convert carbon dioxide to oxygen at night, theyrsquore popular bedroom plants.Another group of plants that are particularly easy to care for are the aloes, which the ancient Egyptians called lsquoimmortality plantsrsquo because they are almost indestructible.The natural healing benefits of aloe vera has made it popular for centuries and is iously credited with the ability to soothe irritated or burned skin, improve skin, hair, oral hygiene and digestion and to treat acne and arthritis.Like sanseveria, aloe requires very little care, tolerates low light levels and infrequent watering, removes air-borne pollutants and oxygenates the air at night, which aids sleep.One of our favourite succulents is the echiveria, which grows in compact rosettes of succulent, sometimes coloured leaves from which flowering stalks may grow.These plants like a reasonable amount of light, some dilute feed when actively growing and prefer under-watering to over-watering. A happy echiveria will produce little plantlets which can be removed and grown into new plants.Carefree cactusIt would be impossible to talk about easy-to-care for plants without mentioning cacti, which have well-developed survival adaptations.Most cacti have developed spines which in fact are highly modied leaves. Not only do these spines help prevent the plant being grazed, but they also reduce the airflow around the plant, which helps it conserve water.Photosynthesis takes place on the stemand its shallow, far-reaching root system enables the cactus to react quickly and absorb any water reaching the ground.Whilst the enormous tree-like cacti of the American desert may be the first cactus that springs to mind, wersquove highlighted some interesting houseplant types below that are incredibly easy to look after and certainly wonrsquot take over your home!There are many dferent shapes of cacti, including round, flat, columnar, smooth, bumpy, ribbed and fluted, and itrsquos important to note that some of these actually change shape depending on how much water is stored in the stem at the time!Not all cacti have fully developed spines. For example, the popular schlumbergera, of which the best-known culti is the Christmas-flowering cactus, has less modied leaves which look like lsquoteethrsquo along the edge of their stems. Their stems grow in lsquosegmentsrsquo and resemble flattened pads, with their flowers being produced at the end of the segments.Although the Christmas-flowering culti is most popular in the UK, there are dferent cultis which flower at dferent times of the year.In their natural habitat, schlumbergera grow on trees or in rocks and generally enjoy shady habitats with high humidity, making them an ideal choice for bathrooms.If yoursquore looking for an unusual and interesting but easy-to-care-for indoor hanging plant, you might consider the aporocactus ndash a group of tree-growing cactus that grow well in a hanging pot.For a cactus with impact, the gymnocalycium mihanovichii is a sure winner. The top part of the stem on this cactus lacks green pigmentand can be bright red, yellow or other amazing colours.So,yoursquore looking for a plant that thrives on neglect, hopefully wersquove given you some ideas!Just remember that the golden rule for cacti and succulents is to under-water rather than over-water ndash too much moisture will cause disease and rot.For more information, take a look on our website at www.merryhatton"},{"url":null,"title":"mary-contini-column-food-thought-covid","story":"To be able to buy vegetables from the likes of Crunchy Carrot in Dunbar or Phantassie in East Linton is my foodie heaven !It is probably more expensive to shop locally and, as you need to drive to dferent outlets, it does take longer.For hard-pressed working families, this is not always an option.

 per cent more than in a normal year.A report lodged in the councils members library service describes a \"motorhome invasion\" in the summer with parking bays taken up.And it said July  was the busiest day in  years, according to East Lothians countryside rangers service.Coastal car parks overflowed with people parking illegally on access roads and wild camping incidents regularly saw groups of  tents gathered at any given site.The report said it was only face to face engagement with visitors by countryside rangers which helped the county avoid many of the dirty camping issues other Scottish beauty spots experienced but there were still issues with indiscriminate toileting and litter as well as fires causing damage to woodlands.Between June and August, , tents and motorhomes were recorded in the coastal car parks.RECAP: Patrols carried out after human waste left by campersThe report said: \"The number of tents at both Yellowcraig and Tyninghame was particularly high and the most affected compared to other coastal sites, with one weekend recording tents at Tyninghame and  tents at Yellowcraig.\"Associated issues were fire damage to the SSSI grassland and dune habitats, irresponsible toileting, tree damage bythose scavenging for wood and generally camping out with the guidance with the Scottish Outdoor Access Code, to the inconvenience of other users or detriment of their experience with coastal sites.\"New camping information signage was installed although high levels of camping and fire sites persisted.\"The proposed changes to car parking rules would mean motorhomes would be unable to use any coastal car parks overnight and would be directed to the new park.The report revealed: \"The council is in talks with Tarmac for Barns Ness to be a potential site specically designated for motorhomes.\" In relation to existing coastal car park provision, it is proposed to ban overnight parking, and control through a twilight parking enforcement service in the evenings and overnight.\"In this way, motorhome and campers can be directed to purpose-built accommodation. This will ensure that the coastal car parks which have been established as a resource will enable locals and visitors to enjoy the coast as opposed to being motorhome sites.\"A ban of overnight parking will effectively close the car parks for vehicle use and prohibit any vehicle from staying overnight \"The proposed changes would also see an increased stretch of coastal road where parking is banned.No waiting restrictions are proposed for the B between Dean Road and Seton Sands Caravan Park and on the south side from Dean Road to Lyars Road, Longniddry.The public consultation went online today ateastlothianconsultations policy-partnerships land-management-rules "},{"url":null,"title":"find-information-google-stores","story":"The information includes your age, gender, profession and interests based on what Google has managed to find out about you from how you use its services.When you use Google products including the search engine and over services such as Gmail, the company collects data to personalise ads specically for each user in an effort to make them more successful.This information is available for anybody to see as long as you are logged into a Google account.How to find out what Google assumes about youIn response to a TikTok trend asking users what obscure facts they know because of their job, digital marketer and TikTok user @tiktoktrishkabob caused a huge stir on the video .She said: ldquoSo, Irsquom a digital marketer, and I donrsquot think anybody realises just how invasive Google is.ldquoAndyoursquove ever thought, ldquohuh, this is a weird ad for me to be seeing therersquos actually a website that you can go to, to see all of the assumptions Google has made about you based on your previous searches.ldquoSo, as long as yoursquore logged into a device thatrsquos logged into your Google account, typeadssettings.google into the search bar.ldquoAnd here, yoursquoll be able to see every assumption Google has made about you, and why you see the ads that you see.Kabob then goes through her own assumptions that Google has about her, stating that it has her age range, gender identity and parental status correct.Kabob says: ldquoIf you have ever Googled it, itrsquos somewhere in here.ldquoYou can edit specic factors, like Irsquom not even quite sure what microblogging is, and you can also turn off ad personalisation altogether.

He says it should be capable of tracking and verying an iniduals vaccine status across the world.It could, according to Blair, involve not only how many vaccinations someone has had , but also any test results they may have had in the past.It is hoped that the data would be transferred using a QR code, which would be scanned by participating countries at borders and ports.In evidence to the Scottish Parliamentrsquos Covid- Committee on Thursday, Professor Leitch said coronavirus is likely to be present in some sort of ldquoendemic form for years to come.When he was asked about vaccine passports, hesaid: ldquoI agree it is an interesting concept, the WHOhave begun to look at it.He stressed the latest scientic evidence suggests vaccination is not a ldquobinary state, but there is precedent for travel restrictions based on vaccination ndash including yellow fever certicates.Prof Leitch said: ldquoI think we will probably move towards that.

It is not yet classed as mutton, which is older yet, sold up to  years old and has a far more gamey, stronger flavour.The lamb we buy now benefits from longer slow cooking with fuller flavours added to complement its taste.

The good path runs up the steep, airy edge of Gleouraichrsquos south-west ridge above Loch Quoich near Glengarry, a superb stalkersrsquo path that has been well maintained by the estate. But close by, at the eastern end of Loch Quoich, just south of its dam, another path leads to the Druim na Geid Salaich, a long, rising ridge that in turn gives access to the Munro of Gairich.The boggy, rutted, poorly drained and badly eroded nature of this path shouldnrsquot really surprise anyone for this is a land notorious for its high rainfall. The area around Loch Quoich, just west of Glen Garry, has the distinction of being one of the wettest places in Scotland.The area enjoys a real wilderness feel, despite the presence of a single-track road that runs along the north shore of the loch between Glen Garry and Kinloch Hourn.For all its wetness, the Loch Quoich area, and its Munros, remains a great favourite amongst hill bashers.Gairichstands in splendid isolation on the south side of the loch, gazing across the neck of water towards the Glengarry twins of Gleouraich and Spidean Mialach. A little way along the road north of the loch lies another magnicent Munro, Sgurr arsquo Mhaoraich.Irsquove often driven along this road and thought that the finest way to climb Gairich would be to canoe across the loch and climb the hill by its broad north ridge. You could then canoe back across the loch and add Sgurr arsquo Mhaoraich to your dayrsquos tally.This time, given the shorter hours of daylight, I was content with one Munro. After weeks of rain and wind, the Celtic winter god Biera got her act together, flourished her icicle wand and enveloped much of the Highlands in a smattering of snow and icy temperatures. This would be a good time to tackle Gairich, and I was hopeful her horrendously boggy approaches would form a deep-frozen highway.A pale sun shone from a milky, creamy sky as I set out but despite the low temperatures underfoot conditions were not ideal ndash as the rainwater that had previously flooded the path had turned to ice. I might have been better with ice skates so I left the slippery path after a kilometre or so, and took a more direct route, over crisp, crunchy frozen turf, onto the Druim na Geid Salaich.Once I reached the crest of the ridge overhead conditions dramatically improved too. Great streaks of blue sky appeared through the high cloud and the sun broke through ndash the first Irsquod seen in weeks. Away ahead of me I could see other climbers on the sharply defined east ridge of Gairich and beyond lay the jumbled hills of Knoydart.As the ridge widens out onto the Bac nam Foid it usually becomes increasingly boggy and cut up by peat hags, but a couple of inches of fresh snow lay on top of old neacuteveacute, hard snow that has frozen and thawed several times, and it was delight to walk on it. Soon I was climbing up through rocky outcrops and crags, avoiding the icy sections as much as possible.Various tracks cross the south-east slopes of this hill and itrsquos easy to follow them too far west, but by keeping on a rising traverse as close to the crest as possible I managed to pick a line through the dficulties to the surprisingly broad summit ridge and cairn.The cold was intense but the views were magnicent, the white crests of the hills rising from russet flanks. I could see the Cuillin of Skye, I could see Ben Nevis crouching over its acolytes but best of all were the Knoydart hills, wild Scotland in all her winter glory.Cameron McNeishROUTE PLANNERMap: OS :, Landranger sheet  Distance:  miles lkmApprox Time: - hoursStart Finish: Loch Quoich dam .Route: From S end of dam a path leads to an old stalkersrsquo path that runs S over boggy moors to the edge of a forestry plantation. Here, another path runs due W up the Druim na Geid Salaich. Once the broad ridge crest is reached the path peters out but the going is easy and the broad ridge should be followed W to the final steep pull to Gairich. At the foot of this final rise a path reappears, but after a while it runs out on to the S face. Donrsquot be tempted by it but continue climbing on the ridge crest to the spacious summit and large cairn.

The eggs are sold with fruit from the orchard and vegetables from her garden through the online community food hub, The Green Bowl, which she set up with a fellow villager and which now distributes meat, vegetables and fruit from growers from Elphin to Ullapool, Coigach and Assynt.The embodiment of the multi-tasking crofter, Helen also runs a tearoom selling her own croft produce and baking, is the townshiprsquos Grazings Clerk, a Soil Association ambassador, and is embedded within the arearsquos crofting community.Itrsquos been achieved over just four years, after Helen arrived in Scotland on holiday, fell in love with the landscape and decided to embark on the ultimate lestyle switch.ldquoSometimes itrsquos been hard ndash mainly because there are times I feel Irsquom juggling so much and not achieving anything. But I love it ndash Irsquove no regrets, she says.She is not the only one to be attracted to the croftersrsquo way of le. Traditionally handed down from one generation to another, crofting has undergone a mini revolution in recent years, with family crofts once left to drt now fetching six figure sums in certain highly desirable locations, sought after by a new breed of modern crofter seeking an alternative way of le.And in many cases, agrees Donald MacKinnon, a young crofter and chair of the Scottish Crofting Federation, the stampede to the croft is being led by women.ldquoThere does seem to be something going on there, he says. ldquoBut there has always been a history of women being the crofter while the men used to go and work in the merchant Navy or fishing. Therersquos a symmetry there with the past.ldquoTherersquos also a general resurgence in interest in working the land. At one point in time crofts didnrsquot have a value. Now in Harris it can cost pound, or more to buy a croft.Research carried out by the Scottish Crofting Federation in  showed increasing numbers of women turning to crofting: whereas women made up just % of crofters in , within four years that figure had jumped to % with women making up one in eery four registered crofters in Scotland. While the rise in connectivity which enables people to work remotely, awareness of environmental issues along with demand for sustainable lestyles and the simplicity of working with the land are all said to be behind a general rise demand from a new breed of would-be crofter.But while swapping the rat race for a croft appears to be gaining momentum ndash with demand expected to rise in light of Covid- - there are concerns that not all who want the lestyle will be able to afford it.ldquoIrsquom lucky enough to have inherited a croft, says MacKinnon, ldquobut there are people who have grown up in crofting communities who donrsquot have access to a croft.ldquoOur communities need people to move in, but we know there are barriers.It includes unworked crofts being sat on, potential land for new crofts not being released and dficulties for would-be crofters accessing financial support from banks. Rising demand from tourism has also led to traditional crofts being used for holiday accommodation.According to the Crofting Commission, there were just  crofters under the age of  in its Register of Crofts last year - almost the same number as the over-s. The bulk of crofters, , is within the  to  age group.In Skye, former Glasgow-based primary school teacher Cheryl McIntyre is among a new generation of crofter who has traded city le for dirt beneath her fingernails and who sees a rise in the number of younger people seeking the croftersrsquo way of le.ldquoThere are more and more young crofters coming up ndash in our community of eight, the shepherd is in his mid-s, therersquos another crofter whorsquos , same as me, and another one whorsquos .ldquoIt used to be thatyour parents were crofters, you would be too. But opportunities have changed. Now someone from a rural setting might want to go to the city to work but keep the option of coming back.ldquoAndyoursquore from the city, you can make a le like this.She was in her final year Glasgow University when, in search of ldquopeace and quiet she took a job at a croft near Fort William and fell for the way of le.Eventually she found a five-hectare croft at Portnalong on the Isle of Skye, where she keeps her ten Hebridean sheep, six Highland cows, bees and grows vegetables and potatoes. Therersquos also a pig which has been known to break out and run riot through her front garden.ldquoItrsquos not without its challenges, says Cheryl, who was shortlisted for the Young Crofter of the Year title. ldquoIf you have livestock, you have dead stock and that can be hard. But every day is a school day and things you never think will happen, will happen.Having studied Rural Skills at the University of the Highlands and Islands, shersquos now the course teacher helping the next generation of crofters find their feet.She warns them that it is hard but with rewards. ldquoThere have been challenges, especially when yoursquove not got wider family around. For me itrsquos the cold - insulated dungarees that help.ldquoBut crofting is great, because therersquos community support and people always willing to give a hand.Speaking of the awards, Convener of the Crofting Commission, Rod MacKenzie, said: ldquoIt is extremely encouraging that there is so much enthusiasm, energy and innovation from the young crofters who were nominated.ldquoThe Crofting Commission acknowledge the demand from young people who wish to occupy a croft and make a contribution to the sustainability of local communities, local food networks and population retention especially in remote areas of the crofting counties."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12273788.jpg?type=article-full","title":"gorbals-can-inspire-scotlands-town-centres-future","story":"Densely populated, roamed by razor gangs and gripped by appalling poverty, the Gorbals became synonymous with everything that was wrong with Scottish housing while its hard done by residents were admired for their strong community bonds, spirit and compassion.Now, in a remarkable turnaround that would no doubt have tenants of the past reeling, the Gorbals is being held up as a prime example of the neighbourhood of the future.According to Craig McLaren, Director of Scotland, Ireland and English Regions at the Royal Town Planning Institute , the arearsquos regeneration has created the kind of ldquo-minute neighbourhood ndash where almost all of whatrsquos required by its residents can be reached within a short walk or cycle - that could become a blueprint for the post-Covid- landscape.:High-rise in Glasgows Gorbals to be demolished on SundayThe organisation is now calling for Scottish Government funding to help communities across Scotland lay down plans for their own neighbourhoods of the future.ldquoThe Gorbals has high quality housing, quite high density and a lot of it built on ideas of the past, he says.ldquoThere is a library, a community centre, supermarket and a range of other shops and it has green space. Itrsquos well designed. There are links to public transport so people who need to go outside the area for other services can get to the city centre easily, by walking or by bus.ldquoRegeneration was reusing land that had been used before, not digging up greenfield sites.ldquoIt was developed through a masterplan put in place that set out how to develop it over a long period, so it was phased and with the public and private sectors working together.Last September the First Ministerrsquos Programme for Government pledged poundm investment over five years to support active travel and poundm to support investment in communities including lsquo-minute neighbourhoodsrsquo.Originally developed in Portland, Oregon, and intended to boost prosperity, health, equality and educational outcomes, -minute neighbourhoods are carefully planned to give residents with almost everything they need for day to day living on their doorstep, undoing the need for a car.The idea has been adopted in Paris, where authorities are championing a rsquo-minute cityrsquo, and Melbourne in Australia where it is embedded in the cityrsquos long-term planning strategy.Momentum here has grown in the wake of Covid- pandemic lockdowns, which have left city centres deserted and highlighted the benefits of communities with services alongside homes, where residents can access public green space, walk or cycle instead of using cars, and with good digital connectivity to enable working from home or at local digital hubs.The idea harks back to generations past before key services such as libraries, GP surgeries, Post Offices and shops were centralised in sometimes hard to reach locations, retail parks and out of town developments.Supporters say a knock-on impact of -minute neighbourhoods would be less congestion in city centres, with urban office space potentially converted into affordable housing and an expansion of leisure facilities.The high-rise flats were destroyed in The RTPI Scotland is now calling on the Scottish Government to release funds so communities can work with the public and private sector to develop their own Local Place Plans and -minute neighbourhoods.It is also highlighting the need for a greater role for professional planners, including investment in planning jobs and ato days when town planners were highly influential with influence on local authoritiesrsquo asset management and spending.According to Mr McLaren, carefully planned -minute neighbourhoods could bring a wide range of benefits.ldquoIn terms of trying to reach zero carbon targets, people will not need to travel as much, he says. ldquoTherersquod be health benefits for people because people can access green spaces. Covid- has shown how people have valued having local amenities and green spaces around them.:A walking tour of Glasgows transformed Laurieston districtRedesigning neighbourhoods around the -minute model could help address inequality in how services, amenities and work can be accessed by the third of Scottish households who do not own a car, a figure which increases to half in deprived areas.It would also align with active travel and public transport strategies, helping to lower car use and boost demand for buses while bringing health benefits of more walking and cycling.Reduced need for roads and car parking would then open up green areas for play, community use and growing food.An important element of creating -minute neighbourhoods is ensuring local communities are empowered to design the places in which they live, adds Mr McLaren.ldquoThe way people engage with planning tends to be through objections to a planning application. We want to flip that so people tell us what they want rather than what they donrsquot want.RITP Scotland has called for investment in planning departments, which have faced the largest cuts in local government expenditure since   and seen % staffing cuts.ldquoWe currently have a fairly opportunist and short-term uncoordinated approach to how we plan things. Planning is not used to full effect, he adds.ldquoWe do need to change the way we live our lives and the way our places feel and look. We need to start thinking to longer term and move away from very opportunistic ways of developing our towns and cities.Stuart Hay, Director, Living Streets Scotland says the disruption to work and travel brought by Covid- is a ldquoonce in a generation opportunity to tackle a host of transport-based societal problems, including carbon emissions, air pollution, inactivity-related diseases, traffic accidents and weak community connections.He adds: ldquoWe need to get more people walking their short everyday journeyswersquore to tackle the climate emergency, boost our local economies and become healthier. This means getting the basics right and improving infrastructure.ldquoBy creating rsquo-minute neighbourhoodsrsquo, which build facilities close to where people live and work, we can make walking a more pleasant and convenient option for many more people.ldquoIf you plan for cars - you get traffic and emissions. Butyou plan for people and places ndash you get more walking and great places to live.Sustainable transport charity Sustrans also supports the idea of -minute neighbourhoods.Daisy Narayanan, Director of Urbanism, says: ldquoCities and towns should be places that connect us to each other and the things we need, and should be places where everyone can thrive without being locked into car dependency.ldquoThe best way to do this is to ensure that it is easy for people to meet most of their everyday needs in their local area.ldquoNeighbourhoods are defined by the communities who live there, and each will have unique expectations of the services and facilities they need.ldquoHowever, the coronavirus pandemic, and the subsequent lockdowns that have been put in place across the country, highlight how vital it is for people to be able to live locally, and to be able to access shops, health centres and schools by using safe and physically distanced modes of transport such as walking and cycling.ldquoToo many neighbourhoods have been planned around car travel at the expense of providing the local jobs and services that a community needs to thrive. It is important that we learn from what we are experiencing now to shape our towns and cities of the future."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-vaccine-nationalism-shows-not-together","story":"In fact, the very reverse has been the case, as nations have rediscovered their primary role in protecting their own people first. Borders are back. The globalisation trend of the last half century is being thrown into reverse as travel is banned indefinitely and international supply chains collapse. When Donald Trump closed the borders to EU travellers back in March he was attacked for being xenophobic, even racist. Now everyonersquos shutting borders. Nationalism is on the march: from Scotland to New Zealand.Vaccine nationalism has now ripped through Europe. Brussels has resorted to the modern equivalent of gunboat diplomacy: issuing threats, raiding factories, seeking to halt the movement of vaccines, even ldquomistakenly trying to create a hard border in Ireland. It seems that the spirit of Donald Trump lives on in Brussels.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"EU vaccine row: Gove confident programme will continue as planned\",\"description\": \"EU vaccine row: Gove confident programme will continue as planned\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media GpLcStQE poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests GpLcStQE.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": :Coronavirus: Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid vaccine approved for use in UKThe target is the British-Swedish company AstraZeneca, but the United Kingdom is also in the frame, accused of a ldquome first approach and, by extension, of hoarding of supplies of the precious vaccines. Nicola Sturgeon has also got in the blame game, apparently claiming UK responsibility for the delays in the Scottish vaccine programme.Opposition parties claim it is rather a result of her inefficiency.Brussels, meanwhile, is trying to strong arm AstraZeneca into redirecting some of its UK vaccine supply to Europe. It is also threatening to block exports of the Pfizer vaccine from Europe.This would be an extraordinary lapse into vaccine protectionism. It would arguably be illegal under EU laws on state intervention and free movement. But when lives are at stake, who cares about laws.The situation in Europe is undoubtedly dire. Countries like Spain and Portugal, which are struggling to cope with a menacing third wave of Covid, have been forced to cancel immunisation programmes. Old people could die as a result of not getting their jags on time.The European press is furious and has accused Brussels of a catastrophic failure to meet its obligations.Brussels had insisted on negotiating for vaccines collectively for all countries above the heads of inidual nation states.This was to prevent a recurrence of the chaotic border closures last April, and the unedying sight of EU countries squabbling over the delivery of PPE masks and gowns. It didnrsquot want smaller countries to be left behind, either. Unfortunately, the whole of the EU has now found itself in the vaccine slow lane.Britain got ahead of the curve, for once.In March, long before it was even known whether a vaccine against Covid- was possible, the UK Government decided to invest massively in the development of what it regarded as the most likely candidates.It pumped money into the Oxford research and, more importantly, into AstraZenecarsquos manufacturing supply chain. The UK Vaccine Taskforce recruited , volunteers to test future vaccines. This meant thatand when new ones emerged they could receive regulatory approval very quickly.The UK Government signed contracts with AstraZeneca for  million doses three months before Brussels.:Covid vaccine Scotland: How many jags in my area The EU held out for a lower cost and got caught in bureaucratic delays trying to negotiate for all  nations in the Union. The EU had still not authorised the AstraZeneca vaccine for use last week, even as it was accusing the firm ndash which makes no profit from the vaccine ndash of selling to the highest bidder.All hell broke loose on January  when AstraZeneca told Brussels that because of problems in its Belgian plant, it could only supply one-quarter of the  million odd doses it had agreed to deliver by March.The company insists that it had entered into what is called a ldquobest effort agreement, and that it gave no cast-iron commitment to deliver come what may.The UK Government has sought to keep out of the row. There has been some injudicious crowing from Brexiters like Nigel Farage. But Boris Johnson has tried to sound magnanimous, offering to help out in the EU once its UK order has been fulfilled.But no way is he agreeing to give up British vaccines ordered and paid for. If he did, the immunisation schedule would be delayed here and people in the UK might die.Itrsquos the age-old question of altruism: are you willing to risk the lives of British people in order to save lives in other countries As in wartime, the first responsibility of any government in a national crisis is always going to be the welfare of its own people. This is a legal responsibility of the state, though one so obvious that it rarely needs to be stated.The sight of the richest countries on the planet squabbling over millions of vaccines is unedying, to put it mildly. Many African countries have been able only to get their hands on hundreds or less. However, the poor countries have been cautious in their condemnation.They need this to be resolved quickly so they can get sorted with vaccines under the UN-sponsored COVAX programme. The UK has pledged pound million, rather more than the EU.With the world watching there is a moral imperative for this disgraceful row to be resolved as quickly as possible.Fortunately, new vaccines seem to be arriving almost by the week, like the Valneva vaccine which is to be manufactured in Livingston. Once again, the UK pre-ordered  million doses and invested heavily in manufacturing before there was any guarantee of success.Boris Johnson made a point of visiting the plant last week to demonstrate the ldquobenefits of the Union.The question being asked in the capitals of Europe, and in Germany in particular, is why the European Union, with all its buying power, was left so flat-footed.It underlines a basic contradiction in the constitutional arrangements. It is baked into the DNA of the EU that nationalism is a curse, which in many ways it is. They talk of ldquoBritish exceptionalism and ldquoBrexit nativism asthis is a character defect.However, the problem with Brussels is precisely that it is not a nation and does not see itself as responsible to any one national community.The European Commission is not a democratic institution and cannot be held to account through a general election. It is a bureaucracy which, like all bureaucracies, puts its own protocols first.Everything has to be processed through the national governments of  member states. Nimble it is not.A delay in supply might have seemed a small price to pay for ensuring that all of Europe moved at the same pace. However, it failed to appreciate that the voters in member countries would not see it that way.In future, Europe may have to become a proper state or the nations may, to coin a phrase, take back control."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12275508.jpg?type=article-full","title":"neil-mackays-big-read-scottish-academics-go-head-to-head-nations-ugly-legacy-slavery","story":"Their explosive exchange shows just how far we have to go as a country before we truly come to terms with our past. Writer at Large Neil Mackay reportsIF evidence were needed of Scotlandrsquos bitter, unresolved legacy of slavery, then proof is to be found in the tense and at times acrimonious relationship between two of Scotlandrsquos most distinguished academics when it comes to the truth about our nationrsquos past.Sir Tom Devine is Scotlandrsquos most distinguished historian, and the man who quite literally wrote the book on the nationrsquos role in empire and slavery. Sir Geoff Palmer is Scotlandrsquos first black professor, and a champion of the Black Lives Matter movement.This week, The Herald on Sunday hosted the pair in a private online debate about Scotland, slavery and the legacy of history.Fittingly, the debate occurred on Burns Night. The legacy of Scotlandrsquos national poet is now under reassessment itself given he once considered taking up an overseer position on a slave plantation.To say the discussion was fraught is an understatement. At the heart of the two academicsrsquo dferences is the way Scotland should view Sir Henry Dundas ndash an Edinburgh aristocrat who became one of the most powerful men in the British empire during the late s. Dundas, known as ldquothe Uncrowned King of Scotland, was right-hand man to Prime Minister William Pitt.He was at the heart of the wars against revolutionary France and British expansion in India. Victorians saw him as a towering symbol of the Enlightenment.A statute of him stands in Edinburgh. However, today he is infamous for his role in slavery.In , the anti-slavery campaigner William Wilberforce put a motion before parliament calling for slavery to be abolished.Although Dundas claimed he opposed slavery, he tabled an amendment calling for ldquogradual abolition and for the slave trade to be ended ldquoby moderate measures.It wasnrsquot until , therefore, that the slave trade was eventually outlawed ndash although it took until  for a full ban on the owning of slaves to be enforced. Campaigners see Dundas as guilty of continuing one of the most dreadful crimes in world history.As a result, amid the Black Lives Matter protests last year, a plaque was erected at Dundasrsquos statue denouncing him as instrumental in preventing the abolition of slavery, and so responsible for continuing atrocities across the Caribbean.Palmer played a central role in ensuring the plaque went up. Devine takes issue not only with how Dundasrsquos role in the continuation of slavery is perceived, but also with the way in which the plaque was erected. Their dferences strike right at the heart of how Scotland deals with its legacy of slavery.Scottish amnesiaWhat is clear, though, is that both men hold slavery in utter contempt and detest modern racism. Nevertheless, their dispute over the interpretation of the past is rancorous.Devine begins by noting that Scotland has only recently started coming to terms with its history of slavery. The study of ldquoslavery and Scotland as a subject ldquowas only really born about  years ago whereas England has been debating the issue since the post-war period.ldquoTo some extent, the passions in the south have already been exhausted whereas in Scotland so much of this material is new and challenging, he says.Over the last decade or so, it has become clear, says Devine, ldquothat Scotland was implicated deeply in the reality and the legacy of slavery hellip Every nook and cranny of Scottish le had direct or indirect connections to slave-based economies across the Atlantic in the th century.He adds: ldquoDespite the fact that Scotland had collective amnesia over this issue for centuries hellip Scotland was actually more dependent on these slave-based economic systems than England. Much of Scotlandrsquos wealth and industrial revolution was dependent on slavery. Palmer says that when he has given lectures around the country many people have been completely unaware of Scotlandrsquos role in slavery.\"The consistent response from the audience has been lsquowhy hasnrsquot anyone told us this before rsquo. He pointedly adds that people have walked past the Dundas statue for generations, and the many landmarks in Glasgow linked to slavery, and ldquothey hadnrsquot a clue.Neither Palmer nor Devine want statues of men like Dundas taken down ndash both see them as important historical artefacts, which teach us about the past.However, when Palmer became involved in moves to erect a plaque at the Dundas statue, he was taken aback by claims that the man was a ldquogradual abolitionist. He denounces such statements as ldquohumbug and says ldquoDundas was guilty of villainy and rotten to the core.Forces of historyWhere the pair dfer, says Devine, relates to ldquothe controversy over the Dundas [statue] and the role of Henry Dundas, and whether or not he prolonged the slave trade led to many thousands of other African people being transported across the Atlantic.:Its time for our children to learn the truth about Scotlands role in slave tradeDevine notes he finds it ironic that he is ldquodefending ndash at least on a specic issue ndash this long dead man, becauseyou look at his role in history, and leave aside slavery, Dundas was an autocrat, unrelentingly opposed to political reform hellip an utter reactionary, and as far as I can tell not a very pleasant human being.However, Devine says that as a historian he must judge historical figures on ldquoevidence, much of it inevitably ambiguous hellip without fear or favour or whether I canrsquot stand the man or not. Devine says that studying the evidence leads him to the opinion that ldquothe jury is still out on [Dundasrsquos] personal role hellipPersonally, Irsquove not come across what Irsquod describe as entirely convincing evidence to convict [Dundas] one way or another of postponing or trying to postpone the end of the slave trade.Devine adds that ldquoevenDundas had never existed as an inidual or high-ranking politician, slavery would not have been abolished in the s because ldquoforces political, economic and military were so potent that there was no way a British government would want to get abolition over the line.Among those key forces were Britainrsquos war with France, the fact that the Caribbean was central to the economy of Empire, and slave rebellions in the French colony Saint-Domingue ndash now Haiti. Britain, Devine says, ldquowas fighting in a titanic struggle with France, not only for its very existence but the future control of Empire across the Atlantic.Slave rebellions ldquosent tremors right through the whole of the British Caribbean and the corridors of power in Westminster ndash the feeling was thatthe British gave an inch too quickly it might trigger the same kind of horror in the British Caribbean islands.The House of Lords, ldquowhich had to agree to abolition, was constantly and adamantly opposed hellip as was the King [George III] who had to sign any legislation off.Palmer questions Devinersquos position and produces a statement included in the book Recovering Scotlandrsquos Slavery Past, edited by Devine and published in . It says that Dundasrsquos ldquoparliamentary intervention hellip arguing for gradual abolition hellip effectively killed off reform for a generation.What has changed Devinersquos opinion of Dundas between  and today, Palmer wants to know.Devine admits that his view of Dundas has changed. ldquoThe point about my discipline is that it moves on hellip I believed that in , I no longer believe it because I look at the totality of the period hellip My position has moved from an inidual critique hellip to seeing the thing in terms of these very potent historical developments and forces which ensured [abolition] couldnrsquot happen.ldquoTom, Palmer pointedly says, ldquohas changed his mind. Palmer says as a scientist he would never come to ldquoconclusions without evidence.Slaveryrsquos friendDUNDAS, Palmer says, ldquogave money which facilitated the debt that some of these slavers had gone into hellip notorious slavers who didnrsquot want abolition. He points to James Baillie, a notorious Scottish slaver in the West Indies, descended from William Wallace, as one of those Dundas supported.How history views Dundas, says Palmer, is critical ldquoin terms of the general public. He worries that those who describe Dundas as a ldquogradual abolitionist pave the way for him eventually becoming ldquoan abolitionist in the public mind. Palmer says he was quite clearly a supporter of slavery.:Henry Dundas - Controversial legacy of Scotlands most powerful manPalmer goes on to point out that in a  letter, Dundas speaks of opposing abolition. Dundas also, Palmer says, facilitated that ldquoblack slaves should be enlisted into the British army to fight the French, and ordered action against fugitive slaves in Jamaica.ldquoThatrsquos gradual abolition  Palmer asks.Palmer says that in the Caribbean part of Dundasrsquos strategy was ldquobringing in young slaves hellip so that in the end you could be self-producing your own slaves. He wonrsquot countenance any suggestion that Dundas was not guilty of continuing the slave trade.Any claims by Dundas at the time that he was a gradualist, says Palmer, simply chime with other misleading statements by similar politicians in the late s, who were all guilty of ldquothis awful hypocrisy hellip saying one thing and doing the other. He adds: ldquoDundasrsquos gradualism is like gradual murder.Dundas, Palmer goes on, ldquowanted to develop slave plantations in Jamaica. When the word ldquogradual is used in connection with Dundas, Palmer says, we should take it to mean that he was ldquorefusing to act until a thousand favourable circumstances united ndash that really means never hellip he was playing the game hellip he was involved in delaying abolition.Palmer adds it is curious that when Dundas was impeached in , the ldquoslave trade was abolished in .Angry exchangesDEVINE responds by saying: ldquoGeoff presents [Dundas] as a kind of superman, a titan who single-handedly managed to produce this extraordinary historical result of postponing abolition.The only reason Dundas was able to achieve this end wasnrsquot because of personal skills hellip [but] because the forces of history, unfortunately for a period, were in favour of people like the postponers ndash aka him ndash or people who were root and branch opposed to abolition hellip We must move from the role, for good or ill ndash probably for ill ndash of one inidual and see this as an international process, based especially on war, which confounded the abolitionists until the early-th century.At this stage of the debate, the conversation degenerates into the two men talking over each other and general bickering.ldquoI just think he was irrelevant, says Devine. ldquoHe was the minister of war and the home secretary, Palmer responds.He was just ldquoone influential man, Devine adds. ldquoAre you saying the lsquoUncrowned King of Scotlandrsquo was the stooge of a whole lot of other people hellip that hersquod no power  Palmer asks.The legacyTHE Herald on Sunday brings the debate to order and moves on to asking both men why the legacy of Dundas matters today. ldquoWersquove a situation of  national pride, says Palmer.Thatrsquos ldquoa deception, he adds. When an Edinburgh City Council committee ndash on which Palmer sat ndash debated putting up the plaque at the Dundas statue, claims were made that Dundas was an abolitionist, Palmer says. ldquoThe public needs clarication on that, he adds.Devine disagrees with ldquothe way, and the outcome of the way, the plaque was revised. He says the issue should have been debated with ldquodispassionate impartiality.He adds: ldquoWhatrsquos said on that plaque needs to combine, in addition to the condemnation of Dundas hellip the context of the time which allowed the postponement of abolition to take place hellip This is such a fundamental part of our history hellip it must be debated.He questions why no ldquotrained historian was part of the discussion around the Dundas statue. ldquoEdinburgh council should hang its head in shame, Devine says.He cites a similar discussion ongoing in Toronto about the city possibly renaming its Dundas Street, which he sees as the right process to follow. There have been public discussions, and the city will present options to ranging from scraping the street name to doing nothing.Devine says Edinburgh acted ldquoin a moment of panic. The Edinburgh judgment was made by a ldquokangaroo court, he says ndash the ruling was a ldquodiktat.ldquoI donrsquot want Dundas forgiven or applauded ndash what I want is for the historical record to be taken into account, he says. Devine adds that by  ldquothe number of people in Scotland who would have supported abolition would have been very small indeed.He says it took the majority of Scottish people a long time to come to opposition ldquoas they realised the extent to which the ramparts of their economic system depended on [slaveryrsquos] wickedness.Palmer adds: ldquoThe majority is not always right ndash at one time the majority thought the Earth was flat.The conversation starts to get fractious again. Palmer says Devinersquos complaint about no historian on the Dundas  is ldquolike saying ldquoShakespeare didnrsquot do a course in playwriting so what does he know rsquo.Palmer says people have dismissed his comments on black history because of his background as a scientist rather than an historian, adding: ldquoThatrsquos dangerous as what itrsquos saying is that my view of history isnrsquot acceptable.He raises the fact that Dundasrsquos statue stood for nearly  years ldquoand that was perfectly okay to historians ndash they didnrsquot complain about it hellip they had  years to write about it in detail hellip they didnrsquot.Palmer adds: ldquoThe council did what it thought was right and as far as the narrative on the plaque, I agree with it ndash and as far as Irsquom concerned thatrsquos it.Palmer says amending the plaquersquos text would be ldquolike saying Hitler isnrsquot responsible because he was just one man and had lots of other people around him.On claims that there is new evidence to consider about Dundas, Palmer adds: ldquoI canrsquot see the new evidence, there isnrsquot any.After another spat, the conversation calms down and debate resumes. Devine says: ldquoIrsquom totally committed to the racial equality agenda, itrsquos extraordinary itrsquos taken so long to reach this point [but]we donrsquot get this right in terms of the reckoning with the past it will continue to be an open sore and there wonrsquot be any closure.Palmer sees a continuum between men like Dundas, the actions and words of politicians like Enoch Powell in the th century, and white supremacy today, which resulted in deaths like that of George Floyd. ldquoWe cannot change the past, but we can change the consequences of the past ndash such as racism ndash for the better, he adds.With the debate becoming bogged down, Devine says he is unlikely to speak out again on such issues.He believes discussion has ldquobeen hijacked by activists, controversialists and polemicists hellip [who] will withstand the cold logic of any conclusion you present.

Meaning it stood to gainthe price went down and loseit went up.It seemed the perfect piranha plan until thousands of members of a Reddit subgroup, WallStreetBets, decided to pile in to support GameStop and inflict crippling losses on Melvin and other funds.By Tuesday evening last week, Melvin had given up, kept afloat only by a bn injection by two of its backers. Other hedge funds lost at least bn as GameStoprsquos price turbocharged.It was a conspiracy by the little guy, and in the case of the Reddit group, the kids, two million of them following it.At the beginning of this year GameStop shares were selling at  ndash a year ago at . By Thursday they had spiked to  as word got out and more amateurs joined the maul, before dropping back at one point by  per cent in the day, presumably when the WallStreetBets punters took their profits.It all began when a serial investor, Ryan Cohen, who had previously bought safe stocks like Apple, bought nine million shares in GameStop last year at an average price of ., an outlay of  million.He saw the opportunity, but he genuinely wanted the company to succeed by becoming a specialised e-commerce retailer of games, rather than a bricks-and-mortar shop presence.His arrival initially had only a small push on shares, going up to . He probably didnrsquot intend it, but he was also betting against the rapacious hedge funds.At the opening of Wall Street and the Nasdaq on Thursday, after the WSB latecomers jumped in their thousands, Cohenrsquos m stock was worth more than bn.For his investment Cohen got three seats on the board, but as the stock began to take off short-sellers had to buy more of it to cover their borrowings ndash itrsquos known as the ldquoshort squeeze ndash as the investors who had bet against it tried to cover their losses. And, of course, the price inevitably went up.The great gameThe hedge funds game is to borrow shares in a company from other investors, put them on the market, wait until the price falls, buy them back,the borrowed shares and pocket the profit. Itrsquos financial sleight of hand, jiggery-pokery.To them, GameStop seemed fair game. It had heavy losses last year and was the most shorted stock on Wall Street, with around % of its shares in the portfolios of hedge funds.But rather than the ailing patient having to go to the ICU and reap huge profits for the professional investor, there was resuscitation through what seems to have been personal animus against them by the Reddit amateurs. Almost a generational fight, robbing the rich to give to the millennial poor.When the stock rose to , Andrew Left, founder of Clinton Research, bet that it would halve. Oh no, said the WSB brigade, in what was clearly a reaction against the old guard ndash and him ndash and bought more, pushing the share value up % overnight. Since the beginning of January, Gamestop is up more than ,%.One WSB investor claims he turned a , punt into .m within just a few hours. Everyone, it seemed, was a winner ndash except the hedge funds, of course.Rumblings began. One online  called Discord removed the WSB server for alleged hate speech, the majority of it against the hedge fund pinstripes.In response, the Redditers said: ldquoYou know as well as I do thatyou gather k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad.ldquoThat room was golden and the people that run it are awesome.

By midweek the loss-making retailer was valued at more than bn, although market logic dictates that this will fall ndash demonstrated in Thursdayrsquos volatility ndash and many amateur investors will lose heavily. But then logic hasnrsquot had much input in this affair.Hedge fund manager Michael Burry, of Scion Asset Management ndash played in the Hollywood movie The Big Short by Christian Bale ndash and who had previously shorted Tesla, warned that GameStoprsquos share price was out of control, tweeting that it was ldquounnatural, insane and dangerous.It may have been all of those thing but Scion reportedly made a -foldon his fundrsquos investment in the company.The amateurs are now targeting other companies that have been shorted by hedge funds. US stocks AMC Entertainment, Koss Corp and BlackBerry all saw their share prices rise on Wednesday, only to fall back overnight.UK shares in Pearson and Cineworld rose on speculation they could be next in line for the WSB treatment, only to fall in early trading on Thursday.The Sydney Morning Herald also reported that a tiny West Australian mining company saw a % surge in its share price, probably because its stock market code matches that of GameStop.Biden his timeThe GameStop bubble has also caught the attention of the new Joe Biden administration in the White House.Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Bidenrsquos economic team, including newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, was ldquomonitoring the situation.US stock exchange Nasdaqrsquos chief executive Adena Friedman joined in, saying exchanges and regulators should watch whether anonymous social media posts could be driving ldquopump and dump schemes.They donrsquot like the upstarts.In the past,you had the cash and the cachet, you hired a broker to advise you what shares to buy, with the broker taking a commission on the trade.The rise of cut-price and free apps and forums like WSB means that anyone, with only a little cash, can take a punt on the market.Itrsquos the digital rebels against the analogue old guard.As one of the WSB moderators put it: ldquoWhat I think is happening is that you guys are making such an impact that these fat cats are worried that they have to get up and put in work to earn a living.Itrsquos a bubble, of course, like the South Sea one, as the wild fluctuation in the share price of GameStop on Thursday showed.Get in early, help to inflate the bubble and,you time it right, come out with a fortune ndash hang in too long and you lose it all.And like all bubbles it will burst.

It pains me to see that with % of our children out of school as a result of school closures, we risk taking away opportunities from our own coming generations.“The pandemic has illustrated better than most things the full consequences of the digital ide, with which we have lived for too long we see those areas of the country that have access to connectivity and those that do not, and the families who have broadband and sufficient devices for everybody to get home schooling opportunities, and those who do not.

However, there is still some way to go before our inter-island service is of a standard we see where in Scotland.#Orkney SNP candidate for the Scottish Parliament elections Robert Leslie said that the additional funding was brilliant news for the islands. He said: “This delivers on the fairer ferry funding calls that have been made by Lib Dems and the local authority and shows that the SNP government is in full listening mode when it comes to island issues.“I look forward to these enhanced services and reduced fares being put in place. The next step will be to engage further with the local authority and other parties on the replacement of Orkney’s ancient internal ferry fleet.”SNP MSP for the Highlands and Islands Maree Todd added: “The additional £.m in funding for inter-island ferries is a positive development and delivers on a key ask from local authority partners at a time of unprecedented financial pressure on the Scottish budget.“Whilst it is the local authority that is wholly responsible for the ferry services they provide, the SNP Government is sympathetic to the financial pressures which fall on inidual local authorities, which we know have been heightened as a result of COVID-.#She added: “It’s worth pointing out that for a long time, local authorities received no funding from the Scottish Government to support inter-island ferries, it is only under the SNP that this has changed and increased over the years. Today, we have a pledge to meet the revenue ask in full, fulfilling the SNP government’s commitment to fair ferry funding.“Considering the draft Budget meets a key ask from the Liberal Democrats, I hope to see the party get behind the budget and support it through Parliament.”Orkney#s MSP, Liberal Democrat Liam McArthur said: “This additional funding for our leline internal ferry services is undoubtedly welcome. Having been promised ‘fair funding’ by the First Minister since the last election, it’s remarkable how the prospect of an upcoming election concentrates the minds of SNP ministers.“Welcome too is the proposal to fund RET on internal ferry services. Some of these are amongst the most expensive routes mile-for-mile anywhere in the country.“Given we are still waiting for RET on Pentland Firth routes three years after it was due to be introduced and  years after it was introduced on west coast routes, it may be premature to celebrate just yet.“Of course, this will not stop SNP politicians from being first in the queue to pat themselves on the back. Let’s not forget, however, that Orkney has consistently been short-changed on ferry funding over the course of this parliament since the promises made at the last election.“There is a strong argument for the millions in under-funding now to be repaid. Indeed, it is a case SNP ministers themselves have been making to the UK Government over VAT payments for Police Scotland. If it’s good enough for police funding, it’s good enough for ferry funding.”The co-covener of the Orkney Greens, Councillor Steve Sankey welcomed the #long overdue# news.#The Scottish Greens won an additional £.million for Orkney’s ferries out of the budget settlement in , and this time around the Scottish Government has finally got there itself, after years of pressure from the three island councils involved and opposition parties,# Councillor Sankey said.“We’ve been saying for years that the knock-on effect of having to fund the deficit in ferry funding has impacted on us here greatly, and has precipitated budgetary pressures throughout Orkney. We emphasised that the situation was grossly unfair, particularly when compared to the huge increases in funding afforded to Calmac out west. The news that OIC will receive £. million next year is a relief, and will enable improvements in service such as Sunday sailings to the outer isles.#Councillor Sankey concluded: “Fairness with funding is all we’ve ever asked for, and now  years after Road Equivalent Tarf was first piloted, it seems that it will also finally be rolled out on our internal routes, although there is still no mention of the Pentland Firth.“Whilst this is good news, it now means that we turn our attention to the replacement process for our ancient ferry fleet which ranges in age from  to  years. It’s essential that any replacement proposals commit to a renewable fuel component, be it hydrogen, ammonia or electric, so that we can greatly reduce the high carbon emissions that afflict our marine transport sector.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They feel abandoned, locked down in flammable homes and facing ruinous costs for repair work and interim safety measures.The National Cladding Taskforce proposed by Labour would be modelled on the approach adopted in Australia and would seek to urgently carry out an audit to establish the extent of dangerous materials on buildings.Six demands have been set out by the party towards fixing the issue, including providing immediate up-front funding to remove deadly cladding and setting absolute deadlines to make homes safe.They also include creating new laws to protect leaseholders from being passed historic fire safety costs, protecting leaseholders and taxpayers by pursuing those responsible for putting cladding on the buildings, as well as stamping out rogue builders by reforming the sector. vw,vw,px, px\"Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has urged the Government to lsquoget a griprsquo of the cladding scandal The party has also said the Government should work with lenders, insurers and other industry leaders to ensure residents can sell and remortgage.Sir Keir said: ldquoI urge Conservative MPs to vote with us in Parliament todayand put their constituentsrsquo safety and security first.ldquoAnd I urge the Government to get a grip of this crisis through a national task force and by implementing Labourrsquos six demands.Earlier this year, the Grenfell inquiry was temporarily suspended as a result of the national lockdown in England.Hearings were due to begin after the Christmas break on January  but have now been pushed back until at least February, when it is hoped that evidence can begin to be heard remotely.A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ldquoLeaseholders shouldnrsquot have to worry about the unaffordable costs of fixing safety defects in high-rise buildings that they didnrsquot cause ndash and should be protected from large-scale remediation costs wherever possible.ldquoWe all want to see homes made safer, as quickly as possible and backed by our pound. billion funding we are making good progress on remediating unsafe homes.ldquoThe Building Safety Bill is the appropriate legislative mechanism for addressing these issues and will be brought forward in due course.copy -.

In the islands, Highland and rural areas and villages across the country, BBs and self-catering properties are often the only tourism accommodation, and the spend by their guests supports these fragile economies.“The business owners on today’s webinar were understandably very concerned that the poorly-drafted ‘Short-Term Lets’ licensing legislation would be hugely onerous to microbusinesses in Skye and right across Scotland and would be a catastrophic ‘double whammy’ after these very same, small family businesses have been so disproportionately hit by Covid-.”SkyeConnect maintain that the fees for licensing accommodation with the council could be as high as £, per business. that the process to determine the fees has not been completed, and urged those affected to respond to the Parliamentary consultation before the cut-off date of this Friday. The draft regulations, published just before Christmas, will then be considered by the Local Government and Communities Committee.A spokeswoman added: “The fees are not proposed to be the subject of a statutory instrument but instead are at the discretion of each local authority to set. However, the fees must be set to ensure they are sufficient to cover the local authority’s administrative expenses.“In order to calculate this, it requires work to be carried out with our finance department as to the cost of processing and determining a licence taking into account income vs expenditure. It also requires to take into account the cost of resourcing the new licensing regime including factors such as recruiting additional staff, building and IT costs.“In terms of setting dfering levels of fees, this also needs to be assessed based on whether the processing of these applications will take longer, ie be more costly to administer.“This is an ongoing exercise and ultimately cannot be completed until the draft Regulations are finalised and we know for certain what types of letting premises will or will not be included within the licensing regime. Once this is known, it will require a paper to go to the Licensing Committee on the setting of fees for their determination.” she had “raised the concerns of constituents# with the Housing Minister Kevin Stewart. She also stressed the importance of responding to the consultation.She added: “I fully understand the concern of those across Skye and Lochalsh. In particular, I realise that the tourism industry has been through the most awful time.

The Scottish Government has not specied the specic fee level that local authorities should charge, and there is scope for local authorities to consider setting dferent fees for dferent types of short-term lets.“As the MSP for Skye and Lochalsh I will ensure that the concerns of SkyeConnect and others are passed on to those steering the legislation through parliament.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/CARBOST-SHOP-1.jpg","title":"community purchase secures future for carbost","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe project was delayed due to the first covid lockdown and since then the Carbost Community Shop Community Interest Company has been working hard to organise the legal side of the purchase.: “We are so pleased that everything has gone through at last and the current owner, Sharon Thacker, has been so supportive and patient during the whole process. We cannot thank Sharon enough for keeping the shop open for the community during the covid pandemic until we took over.“Sharon has also been a great help to our newly appointed manager, Ted McMullen, and supported the handover process. This all meant we were able to keep the shop open during this period and continue to provide a vital service for the community. We are also really pleased current and experienced staff member Fiona MacLeod is continuing working for us.“The local community have been great from the very beginning and are continuing to support our new manager, Ted, as he settles into his new role.”The Scottish Land Fund, who provided the £, of funds to purchase the shop have been great to work with, said Cathy, and supported the community fully during the project.“We are really grateful that they believed in our project and helped us to keep our shop in Carbost,” she added. “We would also like to thank Minginish Community Hall Association and their project officer Henrik Micksi who supported the project in the early days. MCHA are also pleased to support the project via their Fairy Pools carpark income and have granted funds to modernise the shop’s IT system.“We are all really excited about creating a really great little community shop. New signs are coming soon with a logo designed by committee member Cath Waters, we have extra funding from the SLF for repairs and these are planned for the next few months, and as a community business we will try to expand and improve the services we offer, for example, we would like to set up a more formal home delivery service.”Carbost Community Shop CIC have also obtained grant funding from Zerowaste Scotlandfor dispensing equipment which they will be ordering soon to help develop an eco-range of products.Fellow director Janette Sutherland said: “I am delighted that the Scottish Land Fund has allowed us to retain a village shop. It is an important community hub and provides a vital service especially during critical times like the current lockdown.”As a recently arrived resident, director David Smith said it has been “heartening to see the value people place on the continuation” of the local shop.“It has been a pleasure to play a part in bringing this about,” he added. that when he moved to Carbost a year ago, he didn’t really get a chance to integrate due to Covid restrictions.“So to now have the opportunity to manage the shop I am getting to know the character of the place,” he added. “It is fantastic. The people are so open, friendly and welcoming – even to this Irishman – and the characters are great.“As we are  miles from the nearest supermarket, the shop really is a leline to many, especially in these times where people are sheltering and when the winter grips the roads.

Officials recommended approval.A motion tabled by Skye councillor John Gordon to reject the application was seconded and supported by Lochalsh councillor Biz Campbell and fellow Skye councillor Calum MacLeod. It was defeated by eight votes to six.A statement on behalf of a number of Stein locals opposed to the Morgans’ development said: “Obviously, the community is shocked and deeply disappointed at the decision made at planning committee yesterday.“It is widely felt that what we are seeing is the result of a planning system that is broken. A system that has lost all integrity of intention and total collapse in community trust and respect. Everyone is talking about it.“It would seem, that a system of double standards exists, where one set of rules apply to the long-standing residents and a dferent set for the speculative, corporate developer who demonstrates no understanding interest or empathy for local heritage or the community they impose their developments on.“The progress of this application through planning has totally failed to uphold the objective of the conservation area and fails to recognise the importance of the setting of the listed building. Neither does it take account of the numerous natural heritage and wildle issues raised.”Approving the application “makes a mockery of the term conservation area and neither does the proposal comply with the terms” of Highland Council’s own local plan, the statement said.It added: “From the moment this application, with very signicant potential for detrimental impact, was accepted into the system amidst the strictest part of the pandemic lockdown, it has been felt that it sought to subvert the right of the local community to fair comment.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/James-Rebanks-and-dogs-credit-Andrew-Heading-edited.jpg","title":"we can learn a lot from old henry of the","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineHis debut book, ‘It’s A Shepherd’s Le’ — which I stumbled on by accident— went on to become a best-seller.It’s a wonderfully evocative account of the massive challenges and privilege of being a hill farmer in the fells of the Lake District.Like all good writing, it doesn’t feel like reading you are just taken on an effortless journey of the imagination.I’ve never been to the Lake District myself, but from all accounts it’s quite spectacular — a bit like our own Highlands — and Rebanks captures that vividly.But what comes across more than anything is the sense of privilege he feels from being connected to the land, the massive challenges of trying to make a living from a harsh environment and his profound sadness that a way of le which was once the bedrock of rural communities is now fast disappearing. The parallels to our own circumstances is quite striking.His second offering, ‘English Pastoral’, offers a bit more optimism. Once again it’s a tremendously easy read and we are back on the fells, among the distinctive Herdwick sheep, the cattle, the characters — in particular his grandfather whose farm he inherited —and the drystone dykes. Except this time we are offered a lesson, and it is one that should make us sit up and take notice.Through charting the history of his home valley, Rebanks shows how agricultural practices have changed over the course of time and goes on to explain how similar trends have taken place throughout the UK and, indeed, across the globe.After the Second World War, governments rigorously pursued policies of producing more and more food. Farmers were offered huge subsidies and incentives, so farms became bigger, semi unproductive land improved through mechanisation and modern practices, and on and on the juggernaut ploughed.Then came the supermarkets. Their over-riding aim was to drive down prices, so farms had to become more efficient. Economies of scale became the mantra. Traditional family farms disappeared, swallowed up by larger businesses, machines became bigger and more expensive and farmers became captains of industry and capitalists.None of this happened overnight, of course, but it is heartbreaking to read of the struggles of the Rebanks’ own traditional family farm, trying to stay afloat financially while competing with the drive for modernisation going on all around them. The le of a hill farmer —or crofter for that matter — can seem romantic, but the reality is often very dferent.Eventually, Rebanks’ father had an epiphany – and it was something that the younger ones had also realised. And it was all to do with ‘Old Henry’.Old Henry was a neighbouring farmer, an eccentric bachelor. As all those around him invested in new machinery and chemical fertilisers, Old Henry never bothered, or even seemed to care.He just continued in his own stubborn way, farming the way it had been done for generations with native breeds of livestock, cutting hay well into the autumn , thistle and weeds adorning every nook and cranny and his old stone barns more a haven for birdle than serving any useful practical purpose.Rebanks always used to take more than a passing glance at this farm. With its vast array of wildle and ancient practices, it reminded him of the way his grandfather’s farm used to be.When Old Henry passed away, the inevitable happened and the farm was broken up and sold to larger businesses. The agronomists came with their scientic degrees to survey the land and assess what inputs were required to transform this antiquated model into profitable production. Their conclusion astounded them: never before had they seen soil so healthy. It required not a jot of chemical input.And here’s the crux of the lesson: Old Henry was onto something, whether knowingly or not. And the Rebanks were to take heed.Over the course of time, as the drive for greater efficiency became ever more necessary, farmers began to specialise in one or maybe two products – whether that was focusing on huge livestock numbers or on a particular crop. Traditional mixed rotation became a thing of the past. It was seen as unnecessary, as chemical fertilisers and pesticides could ensure continued productivity and profitability.But, through time, it all led, perhaps inevitably, to the destruction of the soil and natural environment. The evidence was there all along, but perhaps no-one had the time or inclination to see. The farmland birds — the curlew, the lapwing, the corncrake — were disappearing the earthworms, such a crucial indicator of soil health, non-existent. ‘Modernisation’ had come at a very heavy price indeed.And so the Rebanks family began to reassess. Fast-forward to today and their family hill farm now derives part of its income from subsidies geared towards environmental improvement: from the hedgerows planted, the trees, the fenced off waterways, from ious bits of wildle havens dotted around the farm.But, be under no mistake, this is still very much a working livestock business, just that the main enterprise is now dove-tailed with nature and bioersity, just as it once was through natural occurrence back in his grandfather’s day.There is a growing realisation that this is the way forward for agriculture and land use – and might even be a way of getting the wider populace to warmly embrace the countryside once again.Due to simple economics and geography, a lot of the ‘modernisation’ of which the book speaks passed crofting by, so who knows maybe we could be in the vanguard of this new agricultural and land-use enlightenment – given the proper vision and the right political will, of course.As Old Henry of the fells so ably demonstrated in his own idiosyncratic way, there’s a lot to be said for the old ways. Maybe it is time to re-connect with the past."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3595857.jpg--.jpg?1611825143000\n","title":"big ballymena response sought for big garden birdwatch 2021","story":"RSPB NI is hoping that more people from the Ballymena area than ever will celebrate their love of nature and unite to count garden birds at the end of January for the annual Big Garden Birdwatch.In the past year, it’s been clear to see how important the natural world is to everyone’s mental health and wellbeing. There has been a surge in interest in the nature on our doorsteps and many people have come to rely on garden birds to bring joy and comfort in these unsettling times. This year’s event takes place on Friday , Saturday  and Sunday  January. People are being asked to spend just one hour watching and recording the birds in their garden, then send their results to the RSPB. Close to half a million people join in the Birdwatch every year across the UK. Just under , people from Northern Ireland took part last year.Anne-Marie McDevitt, RSPB NI Head of Species, said: “With more people having to stay at home over the past year, everyone has been spending more time outdoors and in gardens and I think as a result have been noticing nature more and having more time to engage with it.“Last year people were asking usmore birds were singing during the lockdown, but it’s not that there has been more wildle about it’s just that we’ve had more time and space to notice it.“By taking part in the Big Garden Birdwatch, you are helping to build an annual snapshot of how our birdle is doing. It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it. We’ve noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.”Just one hour every year for the last four decades has made the RSPB’s Big Garden Birdwatch the world’s largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted. Last year’s results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the Big Garden Birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens. Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  , starlings were the most-spotted birds in counties Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry – ahead of house sparrows – while Fermanagh’s number one bird was the chaffinch.Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world. While house sparrows and starlings may be the UK’s most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at Big Garden Birdwatch data shows that numbers have dropped dramatically since the Birdwatch began in . House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %. It’s a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.

The duo also raised money during last summer#s lockdown to buy washing machines for a group of vulnerable families. My background is in teaching and I do a lot of school support work for the organisation I am with now, explained Peter.The big thing over the last while is laptops and devices for homeschooling. The fact we are in another lockdown means this issue has raised its head again.Jackie is a social worker and works directly with families in the area. We spoke a couple of weeks ago and he said this was a real problem.As soon as the money clears from the crowdfunding, we are going to buy loads of devices and second-hand refurbished ones and get them out to local schools around Leicester. If those kids haven#t got broadband and Wi-Fi, we will also be trying to work with companies to get dongles and access sorted.It is quite a local project, but it will make a big dference to those families. I have two kids of my own and it is hard enough as an ex-teacher even to motivate them to do home learning. I just can#t imagine what it is like for families with no devices, or maybe only one between three kids.The Northern Ireland connection to the project doesn#t end with Peter and Jackie, with the studio space for the gigs provided by Jon O#Neill - whose family is originally from Omagh - and his Yellow Bean Studios.Formerly gigging around Belfast in his student days, Peter explained having the chance to play to the virtual audience over the weekend has been a great buzz.It was brilliant being back in a room - albeit socially distanced - and seeing mates and colleagues, added Peter.Lots of the guys have lost out on touring and their careers have been put on hold. They continue to dig deep themselves and are so generous with their talent. Getting to play music again is fantastic. We#re delighted with the amount raised so far and the response to the gigs.Anyone wishing to donate to the BroadBand Aid project should visit: https:www.crowdfunder broadband-aidBelfast Most ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations at loyalist funeral Michael Stone#s gun used by IRA to kill babyCo Armagh woman accused of forcing man into sexual activityEamon McCourt#s family cut ties with Sinn Fein after funeralSinn Fein councillor praises #great send-off# for ex-IRA prisoner Eamon McCourtLatest EducationDeluge of parents wanting kids to repeat year #a recipe for chaos#Controversial plans to merge three Co Down schools into new , pupil grammar school press aheadViewpointOpinionDecision on schools tough but necessarySteps must be taken to help pupils prepare forto the classroom, urges AllianceLatest from Belfast Bloody Sunday: low key memorial service heldLuis Suarez hits brace as Atletico Madrid go  points clear with win over Cadiz things we learned from this weekend’s Premier League actionDavid Luiz is ‘key role model’ for Arsenal youngsters, insists Mikel ArtetaCarlo Ancelotti calls for more from Richarlison,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNew guidance on hauliers picking up multiple loads for transfer from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has been published By Michael McHugh, PAJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailNew guidance on hauliers picking up mixed food loads for transfer from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has been published.The industry gave a cautious welcome to the Government advice.The Northern Ireland Protocol keeps the country in line with EU trade rules and animal products require special certication.A statement from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairssaid: “Freight volumes into Northern Ireland’s ports are at normal levels for this time of year and there have been no signicant queues.Our new approach to the movement of mixed food loads into Northern Ireland, known as groupage, is more flexible and gives businesses further options as to how they meet the required SPS checksDefra statement“We have always been clear that as the Northern Ireland Protocol is implemented we would work very closely with industry and DAERAto improve ways of operating.“Our new approach to the movement of mixed food loads into Northern Ireland, known as groupage, is more flexible and gives businesses further options as to how they meet the required SPSchecks and we will continue to offer our support to hauliers and suppliers as this beds in.”Agriculture departments in Northern Ireland and Great Britain have worked with hauliers to establish the new groupage model which will aid the movements of these loads into Northern Ireland.Following successful trials with industry involving taking goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, two groupage models have been agreed.Groupage means lorries in the rest of the UK picking up goods at multiple points for transit across the Irish Sea.It is a common method of reducing delivery costs for smaller retailers.Paperwork required due to the protocol had created problems with that because lorry containers were being opened and resealed multiple times.Defra proposed two models, one using “consolidation hubs” in which all mixed products arrived at one premises, were consolidated and certied as a single unit then sealed.Logistics UK is cautiously optimistic that the solution proposed will help prevent delaysAlex Veitch, Logistics UKThe other, known as a “linear model”, meant every inidual consignment like an inidual pallet would be checked and sealed by a certying officer before the haulier moved on to the next pick-up.The consolidated load would be sealed at the final point of dispatch before leaving for the port.Haulage industry body Logistics UK’s general manager of policy Alex Veitch said it followed pressure from the sector to ease the administrative burden after Brexit.He said: “Logistics UK is cautiously optimistic that the solution proposed will help prevent delays, by reducing the number of vehicles needing to be inspected on arrival in Northern Irelandadministered correctly.“The sector will continue to work closely with both Defra and DAERA as the scheme develops, because it is still untested for larger volumes of traffic and it is clear that further IT developments will be required as the system evolves.“As the scheme expands, it will be vital for government to work closely with Great Britain companies sending goods to Northern Ireland to ensure they are fully briefed on how to prepare groupage loads of SPS goods for Northern Ireland.”PAMost ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations

People like me have been silenced for too long and now feel disenfranchised by the way it has been handled.Mr McCollum said he read the results of the independent inquiry into mother and baby homes in the Republic earlier this month, but felt there were too many pieces of the jigsaw missing.Read MoreMother and baby homes inquiry must have powers to deliver justice – survivorsCatholic and Church of Ireland primates express shame over mother and baby homesThere wasn#t a focus on the border like I thought there would be, he said.We were trafficked and the Church didn#t recognise the Border. That#s why it#s vital that the investigation in the North looks at all of these key points.Last week#s report shows that of the babies sent to Co Donegal from Co Down,  were recorded as being adopted in the Republic and  were ed to Northern Ireland to be adopted.The records also indicate that  babies were adopted using the services of the St Patrick#s Guild in Dublin, with  of them adopted in the Republic.Three babies were adopted in Dublin through the Catholic Protection and Rescue Society of Ireland three were adopted from the Holy Faith Convent in Eccles Street, Dublin and two were adopted through St Anne#s Adoption Agency in Cork.All of these children went to live in the Republic.The research also revealed a number of babies were taken to the United States, with one baby boy being taken from Northern Ireland to Co Donegal in  and adopted by a couple in New York.Another, born in  and moved to St Patrick#s Guild in Dublin, was adopted by a family in Illinois in .There has never been a more appropriate time to highlight the wrongs, Mr McCollum said.I want to highlight the cruelty, the mistreatment of children like me, he said.It galls me when they say these homes were a place of refuge.Those involved had a warped sense of reality.Irish IndependentMost ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations at loyalist funeral Michael Stone#s gun used by IRA to kill babyCo Armagh woman accused of forcing man into sexual activityEamon McCourt#s family cut ties with Sinn Fein after funeralSinn Fein councillor praises #great send-off# for ex-IRA prisoner Eamon McCourtLatest Northern IrelandBloody Sunday: low key memorial service heldDUP MLA: Mourners at loyalist funeral #must face consequences#Republicans blamed after weapon part discovered during Co Down security alert School of rock: NI duo#s gigs support online learning#We#re not out of the woods yet# as freezing weather s to NI againLatest from Belfast Bloody Sunday: low key memorial service heldLuis Suarez hits brace as Atletico Madrid go  points clear with win over Cadiz things we learned from this weekend’s Premier League actionDavid Luiz is ‘key role model’ for Arsenal youngsters, insists Mikel ArtetaCarlo Ancelotti calls for more from Richarlison,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As that snow starts to fall as rain later on and falling on cold ground, it could turn to black ice and turn the snow rather slushy.This could cause further issues as we head into Tuesday evening and is likely to leave many untreated rural roads particularly troublesome for drivers and essential workers.The message is to take extra precautions. We always advise people to keep up-to-date and we do review the warnings regularly. The government advice at the moment is to keep all travel essential. Any journey that can be delayed by a day would be advisable and suggested.Moving beyond Tuesday, while it will briefly turn milder on Wednesday, there is still the potential for further wintry weather into Thursday and the weekend, with colder air ing from the north. More likely is that any precipitation will fall as rain. However, the risk of ice is likely to remain.The middle of the week and onwards will be temporarily less cold for a short time, but ing colder weather is expected for the end of the week and indeed into next weekend, added Mr Miall.We are definitely not out of the woods just yet with regard to winter weather.Belfast Most ReadCovid rules dead and buried: UVF chiefs caught breaking regulations at loyalist funeral Michael Stone#s gun used by IRA to kill babyCo Armagh woman accused of forcing man into sexual activityEamon McCourt#s family cut ties with Sinn Fein after funeralSinn Fein councillor praises #great send-off# for ex-IRA prisoner Eamon McCourtLatest Northern IrelandBloody Sunday: low key memorial service heldDUP MLA: Mourners at loyalist funeral #must face consequences#Republicans blamed after weapon part discovered during Co Down security alert School of rock: NI duo#s gigs support online learningLatest from Belfast Bloody Sunday: low key memorial service heldLuis Suarez hits brace as Atletico Madrid go  points clear with win over Cadiz things we learned from this weekend’s Premier League actionDavid Luiz is ‘key role model’ for Arsenal youngsters, insists Mikel ArtetaCarlo Ancelotti calls for more from Richarlison,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It eyes a small bird skipping along in front of it. The cat crouches and snarls, but its all a bit half-hearted. The bird flies off. The cat continues its stroll up the hill towards the Heaney HomePlace. Nonplussed. Its a common feeling at the moment as people battle the lockdown-enhanced January blues. Though it isnt quite business as usual, Bellaghy is far from a ghost town.  The scene last week at Bellaghys mini-roundabout. A steady flow of lorries navigate its narrow streets as they head for the roomier surroundings promised by A dual carriageway. googletag.cmd.push Occasionally, a slow-moving vehicle leads a convoy of frustrated motorists through the town. There are no traffic lights, but an unwritten system appears to be in place. Motorists wave pedestrians across the road and traffic pauses accordingly to facilitate their safe passage. Polite waves are offered in . Several notices placed on buildings up and down Main Street implore drivers not to park in front of their access gates. One is particularly vocerous in its insistence, with a huge notice in red above the entry and a smaller one on either side. I find myself hoping someone does park there. Ive a feeling the fallout would be spectacular. googletag.cmd.push A neon sign above the Spar shop transmits a silent traders call. Hawking wares for the st century. Skinny whips - pound. Coors  pack - pound.. Tempting. The intermittent thermometer displayed on the screen keeps passers-by up to date on the current temperature. Greying sky unleashes a squall of hail, prompting a waiting NI Electricity worker to take shelter under the canopy of Poets Corner.  The cafe itself is open for takeaway food and drinks. Inside, the woman behind the screen says it has been quiet so far today. Its cold outside, she offers by way of explanation. “Seven degrees,” I inform her, drawing on Spars meteorological information.     It doesnt stay quiet too long as the lunch time trade begins to build. The cafe operates responsibly, only permitting two customers inside at a time. Mask compliance is high in the village. Owner Rebecca explains they take the safety precautions seriously. “We try our best to make sure there arent many queues, we cant have people standing in the shop, or anything like that,” she says. “Its horrible to see the other places closed. I would know the owner of the bar next door very well, its a sin to see everywhere closed and people not working. “We closed during the first lockdown and didnt open again until June, but we didnt get any grants or anything because we were a new business. “This time we stayed open because we have got so busy with the takeaways that we can still operate, which is a good thing. “There werent as many people about at all during the first lockdown, but there seem to be more out walking about now. “The shops are definitely quieter, but there are more people out walking around to exercise.” A man in the cafe who had greeted me exuberantly up the street does so again. His enthusiasm is infectious, social distancing or not. Those brief interchanges, that leave a smile on your face, have even greater effect these days. People remain resolute despite all setbacks. Heading up Castle Street, it becomes apparent just how quiet the shops actually are. A sign in the charity shop window informs passers-by it is closed until further notice. Turf Man hard at it. The hairdressers next door lies in darkness, as does the barber further up the street. Outside the Bellaghy Bawn, though, Turf Man is perpetually busy. I tweet out a picture, asking people to guess the location. One reply suggests I wont get many quotes off Turf Man. The quiet man at the quiet end of town. Walking down the Ballyscullion Road towards Paacuteirc Seaacuten de Bruacuten, the traffic noise subsides to a faint rumble. My footsteps begin to echo off the low walls of the houses on my left. A bottle blown across the road by the stf breeze rattles into earshot, against a backdrop of chirping birds. It is quiet down here. Some walkers are braving the changeable weather to get their steps in. A woman walking her dog walks along the empty stand on the far side of the pitch. I contemplate the plaque commemorating Sean Brown. The words remembering his tragic death are framed by a bleak sky. In need of inspiration, I head for Seamus Heaneys grave. At the chapel, two men are standing on scaffolding that reaches half way up its tower, staring upwards. With all churches closed, they can work largely undisturbed. The grave of Seamus Heaney. There is no one  in the graveyard, not even weary home-schooling parents taking a school trip to the Poet Laureates resting place. On the way back into the town, three children are playing in the yard of Bellaghy Primary School. A member of staff supervises. Their laughter carries on the breeze all the way down the hill. If only the drivers shooting disapproving looks at each other on the roundabout could hear it. Throughout Bellaghy, there are sets of outdoor chairs set into the concrete pavements. Under normal circumstances, people would be passing their lunchtime sitting in them, chatting to others. As I sit outside the pharmacy, the postman pulls up to the Spar, collecting letters and parcels from its post office. An NI Water van passes through. An Ulsterbus carrying just two passengers. Tractors rattle busily up and down the street. A DHL delivery van approaches the roundabout, the driver glancing at the street signs before turning left towards Castledawson. The unsung are quietly grafting away, navigating the pandemic and ensuring le goes on. No rest for the essential.  Back in the car, a radio bulletin announces the Northern Ireland Executive have extended lockdown measures for a month. Normalitys odds have ened. So much of normal le feels empty at present. The constant cycle of infection, sickness and death has hollowed it out. Leaving Bellaghy, Im struck by the symbolism of those empty chairs. Despite your best efforts, sometimes grim reminders are impossible to avoid.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It eyes a small bird skipping along in front of it. The cat crouches and snarls, but its all a bit half-hearted. The bird flies off. The cat continues its stroll up the hill towards the Heaney HomePlace. Nonplussed. Its a common feeling at the moment as people battle the lockdown-enhanced January blues. Though it isnt quite business as usual, Bellaghy is far from a ghost town.  The scene last week at Bellaghys mini-roundabout. A steady flow of lorries navigate its narrow streets as they head for the roomier surroundings promised by A dual carriageway. googletag.cmd.push Occasionally, a slow-moving vehicle leads a convoy of frustrated motorists through the town. There are no traffic lights, but an unwritten system appears to be in place. Motorists wave pedestrians across the road and traffic pauses accordingly to facilitate their safe passage. Polite waves are offered in . Several notices placed on buildings up and down Main Street implore drivers not to park in front of their access gates. One is particularly vocerous in its insistence, with a huge notice in red above the entry and a smaller one on either side. I find myself hoping someone does park there. Ive a feeling the fallout would be spectacular. googletag.cmd.push A neon sign above the Spar shop transmits a silent traders call. Hawking wares for the st century. Skinny whips - pound. Coors  pack - pound.. Tempting. The intermittent thermometer displayed on the screen keeps passers-by up to date on the current temperature. Greying sky unleashes a squall of hail, prompting a waiting NI Electricity worker to take shelter under the canopy of Poets Corner.  The cafe itself is open for takeaway food and drinks. Inside, the woman behind the screen says it has been quiet so far today. Its cold outside, she offers by way of explanation. “Seven degrees,” I inform her, drawing on Spars meteorological information.     It doesnt stay quiet too long as the lunch time trade begins to build. The cafe operates responsibly, only permitting two customers inside at a time. Mask compliance is high in the village. Owner Rebecca explains they take the safety precautions seriously. “We try our best to make sure there arent many queues, we cant have people standing in the shop, or anything like that,” she says. “Its horrible to see the other places closed. I would know the owner of the bar next door very well, its a sin to see everywhere closed and people not working. “We closed during the first lockdown and didnt open again until June, but we didnt get any grants or anything because we were a new business. “This time we stayed open because we have got so busy with the takeaways that we can still operate, which is a good thing. “There werent as many people about at all during the first lockdown, but there seem to be more out walking about now. “The shops are definitely quieter, but there are more people out walking around to exercise.” A man in the cafe who had greeted me exuberantly up the street does so again. His enthusiasm is infectious, social distancing or not. Those brief interchanges, that leave a smile on your face, have even greater effect these days. People remain resolute despite all setbacks. Heading up Castle Street, it becomes apparent just how quiet the shops actually are. A sign in the charity shop window informs passers-by it is closed until further notice. Turf Man hard at it. The hairdressers next door lies in darkness, as does the barber further up the street. Outside the Bellaghy Bawn, though, Turf Man is perpetually busy. I tweet out a picture, asking people to guess the location. One reply suggests I wont get many quotes off Turf Man. The quiet man at the quiet end of town. Walking down the Ballyscullion Road towards Paacuteirc Seaacuten de Bruacuten, the traffic noise subsides to a faint rumble. My footsteps begin to echo off the low walls of the houses on my left.

Ladies football and camogie, while they bring so much to the association, are still on the fringes. To a few, they have the same respect as their male counterparts, but not by all. I write this as the news breaks of Kamala Harris being sworn in as the first female Vice President of the USA, at a time when new President Joe Biden set about uniting the country. The camogieand ladies footballboards were formed after the main body of the GAA in , but to many they have always come under the loose GAA umbrella. But officially, and more importantly, they should all be part of one association. googletag.cmd.push At county level, venues for camogie and ladies are rolled out after football and hurling have theirs set in stone. Its not uncommon for teams to be finalising their training without knowing where they are playing. Just like in Croke Park, all provinces and counties have their separate fixtures boards. But Id like to see it all rolled into one. It just makes sense on so many levels. Teresa McKennaand Colette Darraghare exceptionally helpful when seeking information for games. Likewise, Breige ONeill with all things football and hurling. No doubt there will be a degree of working together in the background. Why not take it a step further, with a central committee that leads the ious codes  googletag.cmd.push There is so much common ground. And, overall, it would help on so many fronts – promotion, sponsorship, links to the media, sorting referees and venues. The benefits are endless. God rest Hugh McWilliams, but his HA brand is emblazoned across all Derry and Ballinascreen gear. Hurling and camogie. Ladies and mens football. That says it all. Uniting all parties is not something that could be done over night and it wouldnt be without its teething problems, but it should be granted adequate time at the committee table. When you think of the households across Ireland, where players are representing the ious codes. It makes sense to have a more joined up approach.     Last week, I spoke to Magherafelts Sara Gribben who has been the clubs camogie Chairperson for  years and she is very highly thought of for the efforts she puts in. Likewise, a lot of males have channelled a lot of effort for the betterment of camogie and ladies football. As a wider association, total integration is the way forward. A few years back, Slaughtneil ran a highly successful fundraising draw. At the heart of it was Bernie McEldowney, who worked diligently with her husband Eamon, as they kept tabs on over poundk. The Emmets adopted the GAAs One Club model. The senior captains and coaching officers of all three codes are on it. There is also a fair sprinkling of all codes across the main committee. And so it should. Desertmartin Chairman Pat Kidd is proud that their club committee has many women on board as men. In , the GAA, Ladies Football and Camogie Association came together to produce a -page set of guidelines for clubs to run their affairs. When you think about the amount of dferent skills a clubs membership now has, the potential is endless. There are experts in fundraising, coaching, running events, health and well-being, all with the personality to link into the local community. It can betied together with the use of technology. It gives everyone the chance of belonging. The only drawback can be those looking out for their own kids, but a strong chairperson and high standards will quickly knock that on the head. I just think that all this potential can be railroadedthe GAA is not totally united. There is a school of thought that feels the mens side have invested all the money in sponsorship and infrastructure and should keep the mainstream GAA on its own. In my opinion, thats a very shallow mindset. In this day and age, equality is everything. Any organisation worth its salt will want the best people involved. Thats how the GAA needs to be sold. The USA, for the circus it has become over the past four years, has made a seismic statement by appointing Kamala Harris. Why  Because, like newly appointed Galway United manager Lisa Fallon, she is the best candidate. For the GAA, they know what all the ingredients have to offer at the top tables finest feast. So, its time to put them all on the official shopping list.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

If an application is made to the council for a bilingual street sign, residents of the street are contacted and askedthey support such a move. At present, at least % of the respondents must be in favour of the bilingual sign for it to erected. However, the council this evening voted to support a reduction of this threshold to %. The decision was described by unionist councillors at the councils monthly meeting as a backwards step for cross community relations in the local area. googletag.cmd.push However, those who backed the decision said it would promote equality. The proposal to reduce the threshold was put forward in a motion by Sinn Fein councillor Mickey Cooper. His motion read: Given the increasing demand for bi-lingual street signs to be installed in the DCSDC area, this council supports the lowering of the threshold for the installation of bilingual signage in addresses within the DCSDC boundary to %.This proposal would require one resident or their local councillor to come forward with the request to erect a bilingual street sign andthis was to gain the support of % of residents on the electoral register then this would be suffice to go forward for approval by Council. googletag.cmd.push DUP Alderman David Ramsey proposed an amendment to Cllr Coopers motion, which read:In the interests of good relations, equality and democracy, this council asks the Environment and Regeneration committee to form a working group to consider this further and attempt to achieve cross community support. However, when a vote to decideAlderman Ramseys amendment would be added to the original motion, it was defeated by  votes to nine. Members of the unionist parties on the council voted to support the inclusion of Alderman Ramseys amendment, while Sinn Fein, SDLP, People Before Profit, Aontuacute, Alliance and independent councillors voted against it.     Cllr Coopers original motion was then put to a vote and was passed by  votes to nine. Unionist councillors voted against the motion, while it was supported by all other councillors at the meeting. Cllr Cooper said the issue was not about Irish street signs but about promoting equality within all communities. This is not about removing the English language from street signs. It is about being inclusive.

The boat, named Day Dawn N , ran ashore on August  last year and has remained anchored to the spot ever since. The retired fishing vessel had been acquired by Nathan Ross and Druso Martinez de Riquelme with a view to mooring it at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast as an Air B ‘n’ B. However, after running into dficulty last August, those plans have been put on hold. It was initially suspected that the tide was too low to refloat the boat. googletag.cmd.push However, the owners later revealed that the bigger issue was the fact that it’s suspended over a three and a half metre crater in the mudflats. In late November, the stars seemed to align to the sailors’ delight a high tide arrived and they secured the services of marine specialists to dig a channel under the boat in order to move it to a nearby marina. The drones were out to capture the moment Day Dawn made it back to sea. Unfortunately, their efforts proved unfruitful and, according to the owners, the operation cost a substantial sum of money. There has been little to no activity around the boat since the start of this year. googletag.cmd.push The Derry News asked Foyle Portthere will come a time when it may have to intervene orit’s possible the boat could become a permanent fixture on the River Foyle landscape. In response, a spokesperson said: “The responsibility for the movement of the boat remains firmly with the owners and we would encourage them to continue to do all they can to have the vessel re-floated. “This is an unfortunate situation that they have created and now must make every effort to employ further resources to deal with this problem. “We continue to monitor the location to ensure that the vessel poses no threat to the main navigation channel, nor that it is causing any unnecessary impact to the local environment.”     The boat owners were contacted for comment but none was provided at the time of publishing.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Colmcille  is a year-long commemoration marking the thanniversary of the birth of Colmcille - also known as Columba. Donegal County Council and Derry City  Strabane District Council are co-ordinating a programme for the year which includes a community grants scheme now open for applications until .pm on Friday thFebruary . Grants of €, or pound, are available for projects that primarily take place within the Donegal County Council or Derry City  Strabane District Council areas and the scheme is open to community organisations or groups iniduals working in partnership with communities. googletag.cmd.push The thanniversary recognises the importance and legacy of the th-century saint, not only for Donegal and Derry but for the island of Ireland, Scotland and across the world. The year-long celebrations will last from the thDecember  to thDecember . The programme being co-ordinated by the two councils is supported by key partners including the North West Development Fund, in conjunction with and supported by The Executive Office and The Irish Government. The programme builds on an Audit of Columban Heritage undertaken in  and is being delivered in partnership with a range of local, regional, national and international organisations. A dedicated Colmcille  Project Manager has recently been appointed as part of the programme to lead and co-ordinate cross-border commemorations for the year. googletag.cmd.push This will include a range of projects, events and activities as well as the grant scheme. The programme aims to raise knowledge and understanding of Colmcille and to establish a lasting legacy. The grant scheme will play an important role in this by supporting local communities to contribute to the year and its legacy. Colmcille  Project Manager, Deirdre Harte said Im delighted to be in post and excited for the year ahead. One of the first tasks has been to get a small grant scheme up and running to provide funding for projects that relate to any aspect of Colmcilles legacy, for example, through culture, heritage, arts, literature, spirituality, language, music or storytelling.     I would really encourage local groups to come up with creative ideas to mark this signicant anniversary which could include activities such as events, exhibitions, artwork or other projects with a strong Colmcille theme. COVID has provided unique challenges to commemorating Colmcille this year but there is an opportunity to bring celebrations to an international audience through virtual events for example. This is an exciting opportunity to showcase the creativity of our local communities and to open up Colmcilles legacy to new audiences of all ages. We look forward to seeing what ideas emerge.

Dr McGinley set up a small steering committee in  to fundraise before officially opening the Foyle Hospice in the city in  and, since that opening, the deeply-valued palliative care centre has been a source of great comfort and assistance to thousands of families across not only the city, but the entire district. Dr McGinley was honoured for his selfless and le-changing work by Derry City Council in  when he was awarded the prestigious Freedom of Derry. googletag.cmd.push He also received a papal knighthood from Pope John Paul II in  and has a sculpture in his honour in St Columbs Park. Mayor Tierney said his thoughts were with Dr McGinleys children Ciaran, Aisling, Ronan and Sinead, and his extended family and friends. I was deeply saddened today to learn of the news of Dr McGinleys passing, a man who has had such a profound effect on the lives of acountless number of families across our district and the wider North West region. It was after an encounter with a young man with terminal cancer that Dr McGinley pursued the idea of opening a palliative care facility in the city, and we are all immensely grateful for his determination, dedication and passion in following through and opening the Foyle Hospice. googletag.cmd.push Dr McGinley has left a legacy on this city and its people that will last for generations to come and we know that his vision will continue to be delivered by the hard-working team at Foyle Hospice. The Freedom of Derry was one of many deserving honours that Dr McGinley received but for him thats not what it was about – he wanted to help as many people and as many families as he could through some of their toughest days. My thoughts and prayers are with Dr McGinleys children, his wider family circle and his many friends. I hope that they can take some comfort in knowing how deeply loved and appreciated he was by all across this city, district and region.

The -year-old, captain at Derry City last season, had one year left on his contract at the Brandywell, but made a transfer request, which the club had reluctantly accepted. “I’m absolutely delighted to join Galway United,”McCormack said today. “I’m really looking forward to the start of the season now. It’s been a busy few days getting the deal over the line – I’m just pleased to finally get it done now. “John is a great manager, you can see what he did with Cork City, we had great success there together. I spent three years playing under him down there, now John’s come to Galway United, and hopefully we can replicate that success here. googletag.cmd.push “We will be targetinga strong start and hopefully the fans can get back into the stadium and drive us on until the end of the season.” It is a reunion for Galway manager John Caulfield and the midfielder who enjoyed success at Cork City together and the manager was understandably delighted to get his man. “Conor has got great leadership qualities, he’s a top player on the park and with the young squad that we have, I think he’s a perfect fit to come into what we’re trying to build at the club. “It’s taken a bit of time, Derry have been very cooperative, they obviously didn’t want to lose one of their top players, but Conor wanted to move further down and it’s a great fit for us. I’m thankful to our board for going out and helping to get him into the club and obviously our sponsors too. googletag.cmd.push “We’re getting a player that has won major trophies and played in several European games. Conor is going to come into our team and hopefully drive it forward, so that we can compete at the top of the table, that’s the reason we’ve gone out and brought him into the club. “Conor is only , he’s played with huge clubs in this league, and he’s won a lot of major honours. I’ve had Conor for a number of years, I’ve seen how he applies himself every day, he trains how he plays, and that’s what you want. His overall presence, not just on match night, but around the training ground and in the dressing room, he’s just a great leader.     “Conor is someone that our young players can look up to, because he’s a thorough professional. We’re really excited to have him at the club.” McCormack is understood to have had discussions with manager Declan Devine in the latter stages of last season about his desire to move closer to home. Club CEO Sean Barrett confirmed the move this weekend, adding: We reluctantly accepted Conors request to move closer to home for family reasons. We also had to be clear however that any move would have to be on Derry City FCs terms and as a consequence, we came to a suitable arrangement with Galway United. As a club we would like to thank Conor for his efforts both as a player and as our captain and we wish him every success in the future.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He has represented Ireland in multiple events over recent years and has quietly built up a reputation as one of the finest runners to come from the city.Eamon, a runner himself, decided to combine his passion of athletics and cinema, and, taking the skills he has learned working with McMatic Media, has directed and produced his first documentary.It has been a labour of love over the past two years for the -year-old.“Myself and my friend Paul Gormley, who is a producer alongside me on the project, went to Vienna to see Eliud Kipchoge break the two-hour barrier,” he explained.“We were going to make a film about running in general but when we were in Vienna we saw that it wasn’t really what we were looking for, so we talked about it and decided that instead of starting out globally, for our first film we would take it back home and start local.“One of the main characters in the film is Malcolm McCausland who is a real character in the film. We went to his house one night and talked about who we should make the film about. He said Conor was the man because he was a humble guy who has a great story about someone who wanted to represent Ireland internationally. He always showed great potential but once he hit really good form he would get injured, so it was about shining some light on him. The further I got into it, I studied Conor and realised that there was this wealth of archive spread across Ireland.“I rang Conor and asked himhe would be interested in an independent documentary and he said he would, which is where it was conceived.”Eamon’s approach to the film has evolved from that first trip to Vienna and that first conversation with Conor, and whilst the Spartan is the focus, the story is also about Derry itself and the impact of running in Ireland.“When I really honed in on it, I wanted to make the story Derry-based,” Eamon admitted.“The story is just as much about Derry and Ireland as it is about Conor. I started filming with Conor and then the story started to develop.“Conor had that summer when he ran in the Morton Games in Cork and was the fastest guy over m, running sub- which was the first time in  years that someone from Derry did that. He ultimately ends up running in the European Athletics Cross-Country.“Because his story expanded, I was able to follow him and show the European Athletics Association what I was doing.“They could see that I was doing it at a professional level so they allowed me their archive. They gave me unbelievable footage, so the story really expands at the end – it’s not just about Conor.” googletag.cmd.push  Film FestivalsOnce the film is complete, it will be entered into the Cork and Galway Film Festivals in the hope of being accepted.“It’s been quite the journey,” he stated.“It’s just under two years since I started. If it gets traction it might be later this year when we’ll be able to share it. I’m really excited about sharing it online. For me I want to go the professional route. I’ve invested my own money into this. No-one would help us, no-one would back us. It was just an idea.”The entire product is almost exclusively local and Eamon admits he could not have made it this far without a dedicated team.“It is home made,” he emphasises. “The music composed in it is very obvious and prominent and that’s by Composer James Curran. He’s done an unbelievable amount of work and he is someone who people should keep an eye on.“Colm Herron, who is Cameraman and Producer, went to Barcelona with me to film. Caoimhe Sweeney, who has a full other story herself, is a great artist. Her artwork is outstanding.“Jason Bonner also did fabulous work with the animation, while Fiachra OLongain was on nd Camera. There is a wealth of talent in it. The Derry creatives really came together and my friends really helped me bring it to fruition.“I’m just excited about it. We’ve needed a lot of patience during these teams but we’ve just been quietly working away and Conor has been amazing. The whole running community has also been amazing, so many of them have reached out.“When it’s released, I think it will just be a nice piece for the running community and for Conor. He is a really humble guy who doesn’t promote himself. All those nights he was out running, it will just be nice to see that. He has a lot more to come as well.”The challenges brought about by Covid- were unexpected but ultimately manageable for Eamon and his team, and they were finally able to show their work to Conor himself, ahead of the big realse later on this year.“It was scary showing it to Conor because we didn’t show him anything for a year,” Eamon laughed. “Fortunately his reaction was very positive.“Once that happened I could just enjoy it more. On the technical side, I’ve shown some other directors and they have given me good feedback for some tweaks. It’s exciting.“ It’s very much a Derry film and it will be nice to have Conor and Derry on the map for athletics.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He also managed the club for  games over  and , saving the club from relegation in that infamous play-off against Finn Harps just over  years ago.Dykes, now assistant manager at Warrenpoint Town, has a wealth of League of Ireland experience and knows what it takes to succeed, having won the First Division title and FAI Cup with Sligo in , the Premier Division title with Derry City in  and again with Sligo Rovers in , as assistant manager to Ian Baraclough.Dykes is still an occasional visitor to the Brandywell and keeps up to date with his former team and after a disappointing year at the club last year, he can empathise with current boss Declan Devine on the pressure he may now be facing as he heads towards another season.“Its a dficult job and theres pressure on it,” he said.“The team that I played in were part-time, but Felix was the manager and we had a good core of lads in from Dublin and it worked really well. Derry have now gone full time andyoure bringing in a lot of players from England and Scotland youre taking a chance.“The football world being the way it is, you lose three games and youre under pressure. Its a really dficult job. In this modern world, does Derry have the financial punch to compete with the Dundalks and Shamrock Rovers  They didnt make Europe last year so Im sure that will affect their budget this year. We all know that Philip ODoherty puts a lot of his own money into it and only for him, where would it be  Its a very dficult job and theres no quick fix in it. I think Decky will do wellhes given time.” googletag.cmd.push  Highs and lowsDykes has experienced the highs and lows at Derry City and believes that with certain structures in place, consistent progress could be made at the club over the next few years.“I would always go with local players with Derry City because that helps,” he continued. “They finally got the Academy going and there was a lot of work that went on, but there was always a sprinkle of locals like Coyler, Peter Hutton, Paul Curran or Sean Hargan, there were always a few. You need that, and you need to look where, but thats dficult.“I always think the model that suits is the Bohemians model. You have Keith Long and Trevor Croly and they are part-time, but they are part time-full time. They are in Monday Tuesday, then theyre off, they have brought players back from England, they have got their education, and they work alongside football and that works really well for them.“For a club that was in serious trouble four years ago, they are going to be up challenging for titles. It should give Derry hope.“The other side of that is trying to attract players to Derry, and I know from being manager of Sligo and trying to attract players to Sligo, its not easy. Its very challenging.”That challenge is one which many Derry City managers have found challenging over the years. With the recent signings of Danny Lafferty and David Parkhouse, the numberplayers signed to the club in the past six years now stands at , with last season highlighting the risks of bringing players to Derry, who dont know the club, the league or the city.“Recruitment is key,” Dykes agreed.“If you have good recruitment, there are a lot of good players out there but a lot of players who might come over as well and see Derry as just a wage packet.“If you want to take a gamble on a player, you sign them for a season, buta player does well for a season, one of the bigger clubs come looking, so maybe it should be a policy to sign players on two-year contracts. I dont know.“A lot of it is geared by finances. I know when I was manager, Jim Roddy was a gentleman and really, really good to me, but it is dficult. We were part-time back then and we were trying to attract players from Dublin, and you werent getting the top players from Dublin, but yet you were paying top dollar to get them up the road.“Maybe they should look a wee bit at the Northern market. At the moment thats flying and there are some really, really good players. Coleraine are going well and they have some good young players andthey got some players who were originally from Derry and brought them back, I think that would be a great start for them. It ticks a box for them because youre getting good players and theres also that local Derry identity with it.”PressuresDespite the disappointment of , and the renewed expectation on the manager heading into the  season, Dykes believes that Devine will get the time to show that he can bring success to the club again, and is expecting, based on his own experience as manager, the current boss to get the backing he needs from the fans.“Derry and Sligo are very much alike in my opinion,” he explained. “Derry will always hold a special place for me and I love going back there. I always found the people there to be very friendly, even when things were going bad, it was really well supported. It is dficult though because youre in a glass bowl. I didnt live up there so I was still travelling up and down and that might have been a wee bit easier.“Sometimes, with full time players, you go to training in the morning, but what do you do in the afternoons  Idle hearts sometimes doesnt do much good, so I think the Bohemians model is something that Derry should look at.” googletag.cmd.push  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I suppose with the first lockdown, things were definitely easier. It was spring, coming into summer, we all had the good weather and there was a novelty to it really. Now though, it has been slightly tougher. But listen, overall I canrsquot complain at all. Irsquom still in training, working in football too, so I am very lucky I have that.CB: How did you find things at the start of lockdown because there did appear to be some ambiguity as to whether the Irish League players could be classed as elite athletes and continue playing  That must have been confusing and unsettling AW: It was a strange one no doubt. Certainly everyone involved in the Irish League, especially at Premiership level, strives to be elite. A lot of us are full-time. I have certainly no problem with the extra training that comes with that and the extra work.But the players do need to be subject to regular testing for Covid-. It is counter-productive to what we, as a society, are trying to do in terms of curtailing this disease otherwise.There has been a lot of ambiguity, but certainly I havenrsquot encountered a player who didnrsquot want to be playing. But obviously we are all concerned that we are able to do so in as safe a manner as possible.At the end of the day, after a match or a training session, we are all going back to loved ones and people who may be vulnerable too. We want to ensure they are as protected as possible.CB: In terms of your role and your standing now at Linfield, you would be considered to be one of the veterans of the side, but you still seem as hungry as ever for goals and success.AW: Absolutely, and in many ways you know that has been the case even more since the first lockdown. At that stage I had so much on with my work with the Irish FA, I probably didnrsquot have the time I would have liked to have dedicated to my own football.But certainly you can see the dference it makes to your season and your ability to hit the ground runningyou do get that good pre-season base in.I was doing my own fitness work in the house during the lockdown.I embrace where I am at now in my career and my age. But I am fortunate in that sense. I know a lot of people who get to my stage and they basically dread retirement. I am  now, so I suppose you do think about when retirement will come.Over the past while, as one of the more senior players at Linfield, I have been able to take on more, I suppose, of that advisory role to younger players. You know those younger guys coming to me asking me about fitness programmes, looking for advice about clubs and things like that, it is great.I am still, believe it or not, learning about the game. I am adapting my role on the pitch too as I move into this latter phase of my playing career. Sometimes you have to do that.But I am going back to foundations and in many ways that has really helped my form this season.Things like learning about playing more with your back to goal, how to use that to your advantage. It is something I have really enjoyed and as I say, embraced.CB: You have played under many of the top managers in the Irish League during your time. David Healy, another local figure at the club like yourself, obviously went into the Linfield job very much managerially as a rookie, although having of course achieved so much as a player. How would you rate him as a manager and indeed how he has made that switch from the pitch to the dugout AW: David I know, never really foresaw becoming a manager. He would tell you that himself. What I do notice about him is, despite everything he achieved, he never talks about his playing days. He is a huge Linfield supporter and he is results-driven. Make no mistake though, he rules with an iron fist.He expects very high standards. It is the job of the players who are there to win. Thatrsquos it, no excuses. Dferent managers bring dferent attributes to any job. But certainly with David,you fall below his standard, you will know.With playing under the like of David Jeffrey, he is a very dferent case. He loved to create that whole ethos of lsquoeverbody hates Linfieldrsquo, and I guess tap into that siege mentality side of things.DJ I suppose, would have been a bit more touchy-feely with the players than perhaps David Healy. Jeffrey would have brought the players to the side, and had the little one-to-one man management conversations with them.But I will say working with David [Healy], especially as he himself was a striker, has taken my game to a whole dferent level since I have been working with him. There is never a comfort zone at Linfield mdash that is the big thing. That has been a key part of my longevity I believe. You constantly have to be kicking on at Linfield. Anyone who coasts at Linfield, they donrsquot last long.CB: Casting your mind back to your days with Kilmore Rec, how much do you think the Amateur League and Kilmore helped you in terms of being ready for the steps up you made AW: Thatrsquos a really good question. The Amateur League is a brilliant springboard for then moving on to the Irish League. You play real first team football. As a player, you can sometimes spend too long at bigger clubsrsquo academies.I had been at the Glentoran academy for a while before I went back to Kilmore for first team football. I was lucky at that time with the Kilmore first team that was there. I played with boys like Gary Curran, Paul Smyth, Joe McMahon.They were players who wanted to win so badly, they played fair, but they played hard. I went into Duck [Donal] Bellrsquos team just as the club were going on a great Irish Cup run that season. That gave me a complete love for the game.But I quickly got to the stage where I didnrsquot just want to do two days a week with my football. Donrsquot get me wrong, the Amateur League, Premier Section is a good standard. As a footballing family, there is a lot for us to be proud of with the Amateur League.Obviously at the moment, all the clubs at that standard are in such a dficult place, but a good club at that level serves a purpose in so many ways, especially for the community. For clubs like Kilmore, and indeed all those playing at that level, it is a real tragedy that there is no football being played at the moment.CB: You are also heavily involved in the coaching side of things with your work with the IFA. Is coaching something you think you might be interested in post-playing, and indeed do you want to remain in football when you hang the boots up AW: I am definitely at the stage now I suppose where I am asking myself how can I remain in the game. It is without doubt something I want to do, to stay in football. But it is about working out exactly in what role that would be best for me.I suppose I have been able to work on a bit of a niche thing for myself with the Irish FA with a coaching and education role. I have done a bit of work with Gerard Lyttle with the Northern Ireland under-age teams and that has been something I have really enjoyed. It is great to see the progress of the younger boys through the dferent age levels with Northern Ireland.CB: You made the move for a time to Hamilton and were up against the top teams in Scotland. How was playing over there for you AW: It is funny you ask about that. My uncle only last night was asking me about all that is happening with Celtic at the moment. When I was there in Scotland you had boys like James McCarthy, Leigh Grfiths, James Forrest all up-and-coming and you could tell easily at that stage that they were boys who were going places. It is definitely a better standard of football in Scotland than a of people realise. I remember when I moved to Hamilton from Lisburn Distillery, I had played for Distillery on the Tuesday night, and then the move to Hamilton picked up momentum quickly.All of a sudden, come the Sunday of that week, there I was playing for Hamilton at Aberdeen in a Scottish Cup game in front of , people. I have to be honest, maybe I was a bit young at the time, maybe the home sickness got the better of me, but I do regret that I came home from Scotland again so soon.I have regretted it every day. You donrsquot want to let the like of that eat away at you, but I was there. I was rubbing shoulders with the gamersquos best.If I could go back and relive that experience again, I would do it in a heartbeat. But you donrsquot want to dwell on it, otherwise it could destroy you.I trained as hard as anyone over there. Maybe I would say compared to others at that standard, I struggled technically. You can get so down on yourself but when you are younger. For me, the chance came too early.It was the last day of the January transfer window when I made the move to Scotland. It actually looked for a long time that Irsquod be going to Aberdeen. However, that fell through at the last minute. I went to Hamilton then, but unfortunately it was just the wrong club for me.I did have chances again to go across the water. When Warren Feeney got the Newport job, he wanted me to go across there, but it wasnrsquot right for me. Everyone has a dferent journey. I was a late developer.Football is a tough place. People watch the Premier League and think that is what it is all about, but in many ways that is not the real picture of what football is, the glamour that is seemingly there. It is so tough to crack the code across the water.It is especially dficult for an Irish kid. If it is an English kid at an English club or a Scottish youngster at a Scottish club, they can easily go back and forth to their family, and alleviate that home-sickness.You canrsquot have thatyou are an Irish kid over there as easily. It can be lonely at times, and it is tough there is no doubt.CB: When you look at Scottish football this season, and particularly in the Premiership for Celtic and Rangers, there has been a complete transformation in fortunes and that in the season when Celtic have been chasing that historic ten-in-a-row. Has the role-reversal between the two Glasgow sides surprised you AW: There is no doubt, the change has been really drastic. I never imagined, despite how much Steven Gerrard has improved Rangers that the gap would be this big, particularly this early in the season.I know Michael Beale, a coach at Rangers from working at the IFA. He is a methodical coach, leaves nothing to chance, and I have no doubt he will have had a big role on the success Rangers are enjoying on the pitch at the moment. Gerrard has done a great job of getting that Rangers back four shored up.But things go wrong. For Celtic, I have no doubt they have found it dficult playing without fans.They definitely feed off the atmosphere that is usually generated by the supporters at Celtic Park.And the Dubai trip has been a really unwanted distraction that has not helped them at all.I do believe however for Celtic it can be a quick turn-around. I donrsquot necessarily see that they will now have to wait years for another Scottish title, the way in which it has been so long since Rangers last won it.Celtic can dust themselves down. Football can be so fluid. That is one of the great things about it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch named Irish club of the year by writers  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH RFC have been voted as the best rugby club in Ireland.The club was named Club of the Year by the Guinness Rugby Writers of Ireland Club of the Year.The club won the accolade for its outstanding community outreach work during the Covid- lockdown.This community spirit, said the Rugby writers, was nurtured from mini rugby players through to the seniors.Club chairman James Kirk said everyone at the club was delighted with the award.We are obviously very pleased.

It is only by us understanding how our wildle is faring that we can protect it.ldquoWersquove noticed that more people have signed up now for the Birdwatch than had at this stage last year, which is fantastic. We know that nature is in crisis and together we can all take action to solve the problems facing it. Nature needs us.Just one hour every year for the past four decades has made the RSPBrsquos big garden birdwatch the worldrsquos largest garden wildle citizen science project. Now in its nd year,  million birds have been counted.Last yearrsquos results showed that house sparrows remained at the top of the big garden birdwatch rankings in Northern Ireland, with an average of almost five sparrows being spotted in gardens.Collared doves flew into the top , replacing coal tits, while sightings of goldfinches and robins were up too.While counties Down and Tyrone both had the same top two in  mdash house sparrows followed by starlings mdashstarlings were the most-spotted birds in Antrim, Armagh and Derry-Londonderry, ahead of house sparrows, while Fermanaghrsquos number one bird was the chaffinch.The Big Garden Birdwatch continues to highlight the winners and losers in the garden bird world and while house sparrows and starlings may be the UKrsquos most commonly sighted birds, a closer look at the data shows that numbers have ped dramatically since the birdwatch began in .House sparrows are down %, while starlings are down %.Itrsquos also a pattern echoed by two more garden favourites, with blackbirds and robins down % and % respectively.To sign up for the for the big garden birdwatch visit www.rspb.org.uk birdwatch while to learn more about RSPB NIrsquos work log on at www.rspb.org.uk nireland  .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Brexit.jpg","title":"Brexit trading with Great Britain ‘complete nightmare’%2C says owner  ","story":"THE impact of Brexit and the Irish Sea border is impacting on one of the districtrsquos most popular garden centres.Beth Lunney mdash who runs the Saintfield Nursery Centre along with her family mdash has described the impact of the most signicant change to trading in decades and one that will affect many businesses.She said changes became apparent in November, just weeks before the UK formally left the EU.As part of the garden centrersquos preparations for the new sea border it, had signed up to the governmentrsquos Trader Support Service, with Beth also liaising with her suppliers in England.Her longstanding supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons got in touch and revealed that he was not going to be able to get the delivery to Saintfield, explaining that it was because of the possibility that there could be soil in the pots.The UK supplier had correctly interpreted the new rules which apply on trade in plants between Great Britain and Northern Ireland which is still in the EUrsquos plant health system and therefore must apply EU rules on products entering from Great Britain.Plants now need a plant health certicate to enter the country, but some products are completely banned, including soil as it can carry pests and diseases, but there maybe even more problems ahead.Beth said it was being suggested in some quarters that there may be an issue with pallets and even wooden handled forks and spades coming into Northern Ireland due to Brexit and the Irish Sea border and even delays in getting wooden furniture which she currently has on order.In the wake of Bethrsquos UK supplier of azaleas and rhododendrons getting in touch, her rose supplier subsequently got in contact via email to confirm that he would not be able to supply roses which had been on order since the autumn for planned deliveries throughout the season.ldquoThe problem is the peat reduced compost they use along with wood fibre and bark to pot up the roses, Beth explained, expressing sympathy for her suppliers.ldquoThe growers in GB are in a terrible position. They cannot take a chance and send plants to us as they may be delayed at our new border. A plant, like food, is perishable and a delivery could be taken and destroyed. Who will be willing to take that chance  I guess no one.Beth said Northern Ireland has the same climate as the rest of Great Britain and plants that do well there will also do well here, explaining that the local nursery is more selective about taking plants from Europe.She said the new regulations were not just a challenge for Saintfield Nurseries, but the entire Northern Ireland horticultural industry.The new reality for some businesses is that it has become easier to get key supplies from the EU, with Beth explaining that she already gets part of her stock from the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland and that this may have to increase.She said that several nurseries in the Republic of Ireland are emailing the Saintfield business saying theyrsquore going to have roses, but they may not be the particular ieties that they really want.Beth added: ldquoWe were told we would leave the EU as one country, the UK. We have been badly let down by all those that govern us. We should be equal to Scotland, Wales and England all of us members of the United Kingdom, but sadly now this is not the case.ldquoOne of my suppliers in England who contacted me last Friday thought there would be no problem supplying us but now the whole Northern Ireland and Brexit issue is a complete nightmare.The Horticultural Trades Associationis also lobbying the government, urging it to work with the EU to explore ways to ease the new rules.ldquoThe impact of these complex and burdensome changes is far-reaching for GB and NI, said the organisationrsquos chairman James Barnes, warning that the UKrsquos horticulture industry stands to lose outsolutions cannot be found..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Centennial.jpg","title":"Centennial celebrations event by Spa Wells LOL  ","story":"MEMBERS of Spa Wells LOL  kicked off their year long celebrations of the Centennial of Northern Ireland with a hike up Slieve Croob on New Yearrsquos Day.Crisp clear weather afforded enchanting views stretching to neighbouring Scotland and England.A poem was written to commemorate the occasion.On Slieve Croobrsquos lofty mountain peak:We placed our flag todayTo give a message to the worldThat we are here to stayOne hundred years have come and goneOur motto is the sameThe Union is our safeguardAnd this we will maintain.The members plan more exciting and interestingprojects throughout the year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Student.jpg","title":"Cormac secures place at prestigious Harvard University  ","story":"A TEENAGER will be swapping Downpatrick for Hard University later this year.Cormac Savage is the first pupil from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School to be offered a place at the world famous American university.Seventeen year-old Cormac, who is head boy at St Patrickrsquos, says itrsquos a dream come true to be given an opportunity to study at what is regarded as one of the top universities in the world.Hersquos also grateful to his family and the teachers at St Patrickrsquos, including the principal, Mr Joe McCann, for encouraging him to apply in the first place.Hard is one of the fabled lsquoIvy Leaguersquo universities in the United States and Cormac was one of , students to apply for a place, of which only seven per cent were successful.ldquoWhile Irsquod always wanted to study in the USA, it wasnrsquot until a year ago I seriously considered Hard, he said.ldquoIt was always my dream university but I was convinced I wouldnrsquot get in.

I have made up my mind to go abroad to work and I think a lot of other students will do that as well.The Nursing and Midwery Council , the registration body for nurses, recently extended its Emergency Standards to allow final year nursing students to undertake paid clinical placements in order to support the existing nursing workforce during the pandemic.While this has been introduced in England, Scotland and Wales, Robin Swann has declined to implement them into Northern Ireland.In early December, the Department of Health said a joint statement from the NMC and UK chief nursing officers explained that students would not be put into paid placements, as happened earlier during the pandemic.The statement said that instead, employing health trusts would protect their status as supernumerary students and continue to support them through high quality placements, which is a fundamental aspect of pre-registration nurse training.South Down MP Chris Hazzard is supporting the call from Eimear and other final year nursing students.He added: ldquoThese nurses are working at the front line and saving lives.

He had a steady line of customers from near and far who came to make their purchases.As all local players will of course know, Jim is the local man to go to for advice on what rubber suits inidual players.As one who has made use of his help and advice on many occasions, it is quite common to arrive in Strangford to play a match, or indeed in another local hall, and find Jim replacing rubbers.He has also given people from ious local halls advice and has moved many on to pimpled rubbers in recent years, saving them money. A good many seasons back, Jim, anxious to give some of the Strangford clubrsquos younger players a bit of extra publicity, wrote reports for the Down Recorder.As a close associate to the long-time secretary of the Lecale League, Pat Morgan, there was never any doubt who would replace Pat when he sadly passed away.Since taking over, he has certainly done his utmost to keep the league going. He has brought in new clubs and written regular and well-received reports, as well as travelling to matches to take team photos.As well as being a great supporter of the Lecale League over many years, he has also been a great supporter of the East Down Churches League.He has attended and made donations for the leaguersquos annual charity cup match, as well as being present at their annual presentation evening.While Jim has been in regular action in recent seasons, he has proven that while form is temporary, class is permanent.When called upon to help a local team out in the Belfast  District League, he has been the only player on the team to win a game.As well as being a title-winning player, he has also proven he is a superb organiser as those that have attended the Lecale Leaguersquos th and th anniversary evenings know.In fact, so many turned up at the th anniversary event that lsquohouse fullrsquo notices had to go up.He even ran out of anniversary mugs for those who had played in the league over the years.While the Lecale League may not have as many teams as it did had in the past, the fact that it is still going is mainly thanks to Jim.It is also worth noting that with his guidance, the many charity tournaments he runs every season have raised a lot of money for Marie Curie and provided some great action for players.It is thanks to Jim and the late Pat Morgan that the league has been going now for over  years. Herersquos hoping Jim will keep it going for many more to come when the current pandemic passes..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-PIPS.jpg","title":"PIPS Downpatrick closes its doors after 16 years’ service  ","story":"A LOCAL suicide prevention group started by a grieving Killough mother  years ago has closed its doors for good.The McAteer family, who were behind PIPS Downpatrick, have stepped down from running the group which is credited with saving many lives locally.They received hundreds of thank-up messages from iniduals and families they have helped after they announced the news on social media.Josephine McAteer started PIPS Downpatrick after her  year-old son Gerard took his own le after a night out in .She later described his loss like ldquobeing under water and ldquohell and spoke of how she had to wait eight months for grief counselling while having to deal with the stigma of how her son died.Determined to improve the local support to families like hers, Josephine was inspired by another bereaved parent, Philip McTaggart who founded PIPS Belfast, to get the group up and running.She was often one of first early callers to a familyrsquos door after they had lost a family member and offered direct help to parents whose children where going through a crisis.Mrs McAteer was joined later by her daughter Brenda, son Patrick and daughter-in-law Andrea who were all heavily involved in the group as well as managing fund-raising activities.The family suffered another sad loss six years after Gerardrsquos death when his brother Michael died from a brain tumour at the age of .PIPS Downpatrick funded counsellors and therapists to provide talk therapy as well as suicide awareness training and holistic therapies, mentoring and mediation classes.The group were often able to provide one to one counselling quickly and became a collective voice for families left traumatised by the loss of their loved ones.Brenda explained the reasoning behind the emotional reason to close.ldquoWe set out to highlight suicide and the stigma around it and we do feel we have done a good job, she said.ldquoIt was always going to come to an end and we never thought we would last this long. Even before the pandemic hit last year, wersquod got to a point where we were considering closing. Then the pandemic happened and we knew that it wasnrsquot the right time. We just had to keep going.ldquoAfter Christmas we knew we all needed to have time for ourselves and our families as we realised that so much of our own lives were being out on hold doing the voluntary work. Mum is also getting older, shersquos  now, and we just felt that we had done as much as we could.She stressed that all counselling sessions promised would continue they were complete.ldquoWe have been family run on a voluntary basis and due to the generosity of the local community, we were able to pay up to three therapists at any given time with no waiting time for those in distress or despair, added Brenda.She said that while the lockdown had presented challenges to the group regarding fund-raising and provision of support, counselling work continued through Zoom.ldquoTherersquos been some great fund-raising and we have been truly grateful but we just felt it was time to step back.Brenda said that while she hope that others may well organise and take over the gap that PIPS Downpatrickrsquos closure may leave, she felt that local mental health provision had moved on since the group started.ldquoWe would hope that the statutory services run by the Trust will continue. There are now mental health social workers in all the surgeries, yet  years ago you wouldnrsquot have heard of this, she added.Brenda said that while her family was sad at the closure, they were all very proud of what they had achieved with the help of the local community.ldquoWe truly believe we have saved lives and while it has been challenging at times, I wouldnrsquot have missed it for the world. I met such wonderful people and we would like to thank everyone who worked with us and supported us.A helpful leaflet called The Art of Conversation on how to talk to a person feeling potentially suicidal is available from local group Suicide Down to Zero..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Running.jpg","title":"Running changes in 2021  ","story":"A SPORTING activity which seems to have developed a bit of a boom in these days of winter lockdown in the midst of the spread of coronavirus is running.With team action below elite level being halted in every sport, and gyms being forced to shut, many people around Down District have taken to pounding the roads for a run, either by themselves, or within their bubble.Whilst current regulations are strict, as long as the running is within that bubble, socially-distanced, and in the runnerrsquos own locality, then it is proving to be a very beneficial outlet for many who are enjoying the activity.Alison Carroll, who is a committee member with East Down Athletics Club, said that she has definitely noticed more people around Down District pounding the pavements.ldquoRunning outside on onersquos own, is recognised by people as being low-risk in terms of the potential for the spread of covid-, she said.ldquoI think even before they were shut, people perhaps became a bit more unsure about using gyms, but still wanted to maintain their fitness and that is where running came in for many of them.Data recently released by the mile-tracking app Strava has shown just how people have reacted to the pandemic. In , the  gained two million new members worldwide per month.The Strava team wrote in the report: ldquoAt the global level, the Covid- pandemic resulted in a rise of activity on Strava like wersquove never seen before, far surpassing our normal projections.In the UK, from March to May, members logged  per cent more outdoor activities than would be expected for that time of year, making the UK the most active global nation for outdoor activity.Alison continued: ldquoIt was a very bad year for everyone last year, and unfortunately this year has started in much the same way. With running though, it is one of those sports that is still accessible to us to take part in.When the regulations on sporting activity took hold, Alison said she and other members of the club were fastidious in following them to the letter.ldquoWe took our directive closely from Sport NI. We were able to develop a training plan that our members could follow inidually in January, and our members, because of the fact they are associated with the club, are particularly stringent about following the protocols as they should be done.ldquoRunning is something that can still be done outside, safely, and at a distance. Unless, for example you are running in a train of people, in these times, it is still a relatively low-risk activity. Both our sport and cycling have been able to proceed relatively well in terms of participation numbers.ldquoAnd from a mental health perspective, it offers so much. It has been a terrible time, for everybody for months with everything that has been happening. People have lost their lives, their loved ones, their livelihoods, running can be a nice outlet to just get away from things for that short time.Things may still be in limbo now in terms of planning any sporting activities locally in the district, but East Down AC members are still keeping their fingers crossed that the year ahead can still be one which will become more positive the longer into it we get.ldquoThis time last year, we would have had all our members training a lot, said Alison. ldquoThis year of course, we are not able to offer that. The Jimmyrsquos K is obviously a big event traditionally in the local athletics calendar, but that can attract around  runners. At the moment, it is just too dicy to even entertain that we could host that.ldquoHowever, we havenrsquot given up hope that we can still have some action to speak of later in the year with events. We would urge our members to keep training, keep themselves ready for when things can come back.ldquoWe know there are people out there who are naturally struggling with how things are. However people are there for you. The amount of virtual contact we all now have is something to embrace in these times. We have found we can even run a virtual league, which is something.Alison is hopeful that normal service can be resumed soon, as for many it is a huge leline to be a member of a running club.ldquoSome people are solitary. They may live alone, or work long hours alone. For those people, coming to the club to train, is as important in terms of getting face-to-face company with others.ldquoThese are the type of runners who donrsquot come to win the medals, they donrsquot come with winning as being the most important thing. It is about that human connection.ldquoDefinitely when I look around the town in Downpatrick, I can see more people out running, especially around the Quoile River and on the streets.ldquoRunning is a great outlet. It is not expensive, and for members of our club in particular, without it they would all be a lot more lonely..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/27Jan2021-Schools.jpg","title":"Schools set for closure to pave way for merger  ","story":"A PLAN to open a new co-educational voluntary grammar school for , pupils in Downpatrick from September  has been announced by the Education Authority.A two-month public consultation began today, with the final decision to be taken by Education Minister Peter Weir.Under the proposal St Patrickrsquos Grammar School would merge with St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School.Adverts announcing the proposed dates of closure for all three schools and the opening of the new school have been placed by the Education Authority in todayrsquos Recorder.The Board of Governors at St Patrickrsquos are opposed to the merger and have reaffirmed their opposition this week, while De La Salle and St Maryrsquos are both in favour of the controversial plan going ahead.In a statement issued last night the Board of Governors at St Patrickrsquos called on parents, past pupils and members of the public to make their views known over the next two months.They said: ldquoThe outcome of this consultation will have a lasting impact, not just in the school, with staff and pupils, but its ramications will be felt throughout the local community in East Down.ldquoThe Board of Governors and management do not believe the case has been made for the proposals as currently outlined and will be re-stating the reasons for this as part of the public consultation process. That said, the Board and management are focused on achieving the best outcomes for all concerned.ldquoThe Board and management ask the parents of pupils, past pupils and members of the public impacted by these proposals to make their voices heard by participating in the consultation process. This is a matter for the entire community ndash not just those directly involved in education.The statement continued: ldquoFor over  years, St Patrickrsquos [the Red High] has been at the heart of the local community as a centre of learning, a resource hub and as an active contributor to civic le.ldquoPupils, past and present, have made and continue to make signicant contributions in the fields of sport, art, music, business and public service.ldquoThe motivation of the Board of Governors and management of the school is to ensure the widest range of parental and pupil choice remains available in the East Down region.Last December, the chairman of the Board of Governors, Dr Aidan Hamill, lost an application to the High Court for a judicial review questioning the Department of Educationrsquos authority to go ahead with the proposal before securing agreement from its governors.Under the merger plan the new school would educate girls and boys aged - with an admission of  pupils per year, with up to a maximum of % of pupils admitted through academic selection.Grammar schools in Northern Ireland normally admit students exclusively through academic selection.It is intended that existing school campuses would be used ldquopending capital investment for a one site solution.The closure of the three schools will also mean the loss of distinctive local school unorms as well as requiring all teaching and support staff to reapply for jobs at the proposed new school.The controversial amalgamation has been put forward by the Council for Catholic Maintained Schoolson behalf of the De La Salle Congregation, who are the trustees of all three schools.St Maryrsquos High School and De La Salle High School have declined to comment this week.However, both schools previously welcomed the proposed amalgamation, which originally included merging St Columbarsquos College in Portaferry.Mr Ciaran Maguire, principal of De La Salle, said in December that he was ldquodelighted to see the proposal going to full public consultation.He said at the time: ldquoItrsquos been a long time coming. I am reassured now that the families of the greater Downpatrick area will have an opportunity to finally get behind the vision to secure the town as a model of good practice, where childrenrsquos education is a priority.Ms Rosemary McLaughlin, principal of St Maryrsquos, said last September that the merger reflected her values and belief in all-ability schools.She said: ldquoIn terms of social justice, I feel the move is very important.

There is also a busy local authority garage and depot and a private care nursing home, with this section of road governed by a mph limit.Residents say that the overwhelming majority of drivers who speed along the road are travelling from the Strangford direction and that the issue could be addressed mdashthe speed indicator sign was relocated further back to the entrance to Lecale Park mdashit has to have any signicant impact on the speeding.Those who live at this part of Downpatrick say while the majority of drivers obey the mph speed limit, there are a number who do not.The new speed indicator devices, designed to make drivers aware of their speed and to slow down, are dotted across the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area and have been warmly welcomed.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillor John Trainor say the speeding data recorded by the devices and released by the Policing and Community and Safety Partnershipshows an average speed reduction in the Downpatrick area of .% and that the new initiative is working.Mr McGrath said that when he and his SDLP colleague initially floated the idea of erecting the speed indicator signs, the feedback was that the such a scheme would not be efficient and would be too expensive, with little reward.He insists that confirmation that in the Downpatrick area alone speeds have reduced by .% in the short time the devices have been in place vindicates their installation.ldquoWhile John and I are delighted to hear that speeds are reducing across the district, we are in no way complacent about this.ldquoThe fact that the PCSP is doubling the provision of speed indicator signs is not only an indication of their efficacy, but also highlights the continued need for them.However, Mr McGrath said he was concerned about the mph speed recorded at the Strangford Road and appealed to all drivers to ensure they stick to the speed limit.Cllr Trainor said plans were in place to provide an additional seven speed indicator devices across the district.He added: ldquoCombining this with infrastructure minister Nichola Mallonrsquos scheme for mph zones at  schools across the country can only help safety on

cross-community event due to the continuing coronavirus pandemic.Last yearrsquos cross-community spectacular was cancelled ahead of the first national lockdown to help combat the deadly virus and with infection rates remaining high across the district, the council has finally decided to cancel the event in the grip of the continuing public health emergency.The local authority, which last week would only confirm that it was ldquoreviewing plans for its St Patrickrsquos Day events in line with the current restrictions and ongoing response to the Covid pandemic, told councillors on Monday afternoon that the Downpatrick parade and one in Newry had been postponed, with the wider media informed yesterday.In the wake of other councils postponing their respective St Patrickrsquos Day parades, Newry, Mourne and Down was coming under increasing pressure to follow suit.The local parades have now been added to the growing list of national and international events across Northern Ireland which have been cancelled due to the pandemic, including the North West  motorcycle races.Belfast City Council has cancelled its St Patrickrsquos Day parade, with Derry City and Strabane and Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon councils currently discussing how their March  events will be celebrated.Local council officials have confirmed that following careful consideration of the current restrictions and the ongoing response to the Covid- pandemic, they have ldquoregretfully cancelled the traditional St Patrickrsquos Day celebrations.The organisation has confirmed that it will be hosting some activities and performances online via its tourism and arts social media channels.In addition, training green spotlights on a number of major buildings, including Down Cathedral and St Patrickrsquos Church in Downpatrick, is expected to go ahead as planned,restrictions allow.Council chairwoman Laura Devlin said it was with ldquogreat regret that the annual St Patrickrsquos Day parades have been

and event partners.She also confirmed that the local authority will continue to review plans for this yearrsquos tourism events programme on an ongoing basis and in line with guidance from the Northern Ireland Executive.Councillors Willie Clarke, Dermot Curran, Billy Walker and Robert Burgess, who last week appealed to the local council to cancel the parade, welcomed the decision and said

Liltingwas called lsquojaw musicrsquo, or lsquopuss musicrsquo.Mummers played one of the worldrsquos oldest instruments, called the jawrsquos jewrsquos harp.Also called lsquothe trumprsquo, the miniature jawrsquos jewrsquos harp produced a twang sound, which changed by altering the shape of the mouth and moving the tongue.Another mouth instrument used by mummers was the harmonica, also called lsquothe mouth organrsquo or lsquoFrench fiddlersquo.Another impoverished instrument in early mumming was spoons, which were played as a makesht percussion instrument by hitting the concave backs of one tablespoon against the other.Typically played with the palm of hands repeatedly moving down towards the knees and back upwards again, the spoons sharply hit each other, producing dferent sounds, rhythms and rattles.Dry spare ribsof animals were used before the introduction of spoons produced a similar sound.In Ederney, the sole musician was a bagpiper lending a hand for the night.During the coldness of mid-Winter, keeping the bagpipes warm until the ldquomarching in tune would be ldquostruck up was remedied by the bagpiper carrying a hot water bottle next to the skin of the pipes.Once made from dogsrsquo skin, bodhrans notndash as a home-made, open-ended, willow-framed drum ndash emerged from a farm sieve used in winnowing corn, and were extremely popular amongst mummers.The bodhranrsquos deep, hollow sound was vulnerable to Winter weather, resulting in the goatskin or leather skin loosening.Latterly, snaredrums with synthetic skins and tightening snares replaced bodhrans, providing a thundering warning of mummers approaching.Mummers joined together to purchase a melodeon, thereby the name a ldquojoined melodeon.Commonly called lsquothe squeeze boxrsquo, music box, accordion or concertina, accordion players such Jim McGrathare called lsquobox playersrsquo.The Clarkesrsquo tin penny whistles and the music from the concert flute, by John Joe lsquoThe Puckrsquo Maguire, had the ear, hands and soul of his flute when playing for both the Aughakillymaude and Kinawley mummers.Over time, instruments became personal possessions of the musician, as was the case with the fiddle of legendary Sean Dan Maguire, who played more than  years with mummers, strawboys and wrenboys.Musicians often tried music out on the spot! They may have just heard a march tune just once or twice, but they would give it a go.Gaining consent, mummers lsquoploughedrsquo into the heart of the household with a lsquoMarching Inrsquo tune, with the next interlude for music being the performance of a jig to coincide with the start of comical combat.Protaganists ndash Prince Patrick and Prince George ndash instead of duelling, were lsquoseamlessly seducedrsquo by music from the reel, and turned the combat on its head by jostling in a dancing motion, with the absurd clashing of wooden swords keeping time with the music.With the fallen hero feigning death, the musician instinctively began a slow, melodic airconducive to his impending death.Its purpose was to impinge sadness and, of necessity, was always a slow air born of mourning or regret.The musiciansrsquo opening for celebratory music came immediately post the odious fight, when dancers amongst the mummers would instinctively dance by the rendition of a reel with a lsquogood ltrsquo in it!Playing at a brisk, dance tempo, the dancers would rely on both keeping the time and in step with the rhythmic effect of the music for their foot movements.Inspired by musicians who understood the dance styles, dancers would whirl the floor with precision and elegance.Dancing in front of the hearth was revered by dancers, especially when it was customary to lsquopull outrsquo, firstly, the women of the household for social interaction.If neither residents nor mummers had dancing skills, mummers resorted to lsquoshufflingrsquo, often with cut sparable boots, armoured with tip and toe plates, i.e. a form of dancing on one spot, with feet kept close to the ground.Mummers disported themselves by entertaining and involving everyone by getting their neighbours out dancing.By having a set of slow waltz tunes, lasting longer than the play itself, this would wind up the visit.The Belcoo mummers were unquestionably the traditional set dancers of high renown.Staging either a half setor a full set , they danced with artistic interlacing and unwinding movements at very brisk speeds, to high-tempo reels.Having just one good dancer, the musician would likely play a hornpipe to allow for a display of heavy step dancing, with either Harvey leather shoes or even hobnailed boots.Mummers were known to throw matches onto concrete floors, where friction from the nails on boots struck the matches alight.Mummers also put wax shaving of candles onto floor to ease and increase their whirling.Sean-noacutes dancing was the showpiece of the Toura mummers, and twin brothers, Johnny and Paddy McGee, were foremost at exhibiting face dancing, such as the clap dance.Sean-noacutes dances, such as the half-door dance, was performed either singularly or by the twin brothers on a space or floor covering no more than the size of a half door.Undoubtedly, there was no better man at demonstrating the brush broom dance with a besom broom than Dessie Reilly of Aughakillymaude.Ballyshannon school mummersrsquo group dance was the unique ldquopot stick dance, originally from the Drumbad area , which has the remnants of English Morris Dance influence.The Ederney mummers showcased the Square Highland, involving four men at close quarters, as it didnrsquot take up much space in households, and didnrsquot involve swinging.As a Highland was a fling, it lent to being performed quickly, enabling mummers to depart sooner.The Fermanagh or Donegal Highlands iations were danced by just two dancers, and are heavily weighted with Scottish connotations.The Highlands flings are referred to by Fermanaghrsquos dancers as lsquothe Schottischersquo, or lsquoCetishrsquo.With larger venues, musicians playing North Kerry polkas and Fermanagh kick polka with two dancers ndash which allowed for swinging ndash had the musicians even imitating the dancersrsquo movements.Notably, the jig for Christmas called lsquoPaddyrsquos Returnrsquo was played marking the ing of ex-pats from England.After music, drama and dancing, a singer would sing a ballad of local signicance, or a light-hearted yarn on people grappling with the frailties of the human body, matters of the heart, and lersquos trials and tribulations.Attention was also afforded to the storytelling narrative of mummers, where the farcical spinning out of a yarn brought much laughter.Marking the end, a two-hand reel was played as the Captain led mummers outside, but unbeknownst and hidden underneath their lsquoget-uprsquo, mummers secretly had taken bread for pure devilment.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

What Mr McCausland identied was a work of “conversion” — the work of God by His Holy Spirit,— whereby Mr Cook underwent, in his own words “a road to Damascus moment”. This had nothing whatever to do with “gay conversion therapy” as quoted by those opposed to the post. It was quite simply, and quite wonderfully, the conversion of a sinner, by the grace of God.    \" fill\"#ea\"  to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Godwas not concerned with whether Mr. Cook was gay or not. The Bible does not distinguish people by their lestyle, but rather by the fact that “All have sinned, and come short of the glory of God “ .God saved a sinner when He saved Mr Cook. His hitherto gay lestyle was inconsequential at that moment in time. Those who defend the LGBTQ rights are too sensitive, to the degree that they see every mention of God and gay people as homophobic, as criticism, as a danger! They need an understanding of God, and His Word, and His work of salvation. This event in this man’s le had nothing to do with anyone attempting to “convert” him from his lestyle. Mr Cook attended a church meeting and, it seems clearly obvious, he underwent conviction of sin, the work of God’s Holy Spirit,and was converted. There should be rejoicing that a lost sheep has been found. Instead we hear calls for Nelson McCausland to “resign”, that he should be “ashamed of himself”, that he is “advocating for ‘so called gay conversion therapy’”.There is no such thing as ‘gay conversion therapy’. The only One Who can convert the sinneris God. So let’s not get carried away here! Social media is replete with stories of conversion of sinners. It would be good to hear the same critics of McCausland Cook rejoicing over other stories of conversion on social media, instead of jumping on the one most likely to allow them to inflame passions over perceived wrongs. Was Nelson McCausland careless in all his comments  Perhaps his words weren’t best chosen. But let’s not lose the real story here. A story of God’s grace at work. Would that it were repeated over and over again, in this by-and-large Godless society we live in.Gordon McNeill, PortadownPetition begun to unseat DUP’s Nelson McCausland over ‘gay conversion therapy’ post——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIN our bridge improvers sessions, we are continuing to deal with opening two bids, playing Benjy Acol.Here is a hand with a big point count that requires careful bidding to reach the right contract.The AuctionNorth has a hand with twenty-three points. So, playing Benjy Acol, North opens two diamonds. This shows at least nine tricks in hand or a balanced twenty-three points plus. It is forcing to game. Her partner, South, with only four points bids two hearts, which asks North, her partner, to show what she has. With a balanced hand North bids two no trumps. South now knows that between them they have more than the magic twenty-five points required to play three no trumps.But hold on a minute, whatNorth has five hearts  Four hearts would then surely be a better contract than three no trumps. So, as with last weekrsquos hand, the correct bid by South is now three clubs - five card puppet Stayman - asking Northshe has a four or five card major. North bids three hearts, showing her five-card heart suit. South now bids four hearts, as she knows that they have eight hearts and at least twenty-seven points between them. This is indeed the best contract, as three no trumps makes, but not so many tricks on a spade lead.The playEast begins with the queen of spades. North as declarer looks carefully at the hand before winning this trick with the king in dummy. She realises that this was the only way to dummy to be able to take the heart finesse. Remember - eight ever nine never is the rule. In other words, with eight cards between you in a suit the percentage play is to take the finesse. But with nine cards between you, the percentage play is usually to play the ace and then the king to try and drop the queen. So, declarer at trick two plays the two of hearts from dummy, playing the jack from her hand to execute the finesse.This wins, as West has the queen. North then plays the ace of hearts followed by the king, removing all the opponentsrsquo trumps. The odds for a   break are good, % in fact. Declarer then plays the king of diamonds from her hand. West holds up his ace of diamonds for two rounds, until declarer has played the king and queen, overtaking the third diamond with his ace. West does this in case declarer has a losing club, which could be discarded on dummyrsquos jack of diamonds.East has played first the three and then the five of diamonds, indicating he has three cards in that suit. We will see next week how he would have played his diamondshe had four cards in this suit, using what is known as a Peter. West then plays his ace of clubs, and it is all over, North winning the rest of tricks with the ace of spades, the remaining trumps, and the king and queen of clubs. So, she makes her contract of four spades with an overtrick,  tricks in all ndash two spades, five hearts, two diamonds and two clubs.Well bid and well played. Without the use of puppet Stayman North would probably play in three no trumps. On the lead of the queen of spades this only makes nine tricks - two spades, five hearts and two diamonds. Declarer takes the heart finesse and plays all her hearts. Then, she plays the king and queen of diamonds, West winning the third diamond with his ace, having refused to take the king or queen. West would thenthe ten of spades, which would be won by declarerrsquos ace. But when she plays the king of clubs, West pounces with his ace and plays the nine of spades, which wins, followed by Westrsquos last spade won by Eastrsquos queen, East West making four tricks ndash two spades and two aces, East having to discard one of his spades on the preceding tricks.What have we learnt . As we saw last week, five card Puppet Stayman, after the opening bidder has shown a strong two no trumps, is vitalyou are to find either a   of   fit in one of the majors. lsquoPuppetrsquo has sunk into bridge jargon over the past forty-five years. The convention was originally invented by Neil Silverman and developed in the s by Kit Woolsey and Steve Robinson, all American players. As well as finding a   fit in a major, -card puppet Stayman has the advantage that,there is a   fit, the person with the strong hand plays the contract, and the lead comes up to him.. Always take care to take the first trick in the right handyou want to take a finesse.. Sometimes it is advisable to hold up an ace, particularly in no trumps, to block your opponents from entering the hand with winners in it.Penarth club newsPeter Sampsonrsquos ladder competition continues.

St Valentine is the Roman patron saint of lovers as well as epileptics and beekeepers. He was said to be a Roman priest and physician who suffered martyrdom - welcoming death rather than denouncing his faith - during the persecution of Christians by emperor Claudius II Gothicus in around . He is said to have died on February  of that year and Valentines Day has been celebrated since approximately the th century.While the Welsh also celebrate Valentines Day, there is the Welsh equivalent - celebrating St Dwynwen - three weeks earlier on January . It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.MORE NEWS:Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers ndash despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniogrsquos  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church ndash which had a well named after Dwynwen ndash can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD. Visitors believed that the sacred fish or eels in the well could foretell whether the visitors relationship would be happy and whether love and happiness would be theirs.She is also the patron saint of sick and injured animals. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

St Valentine is the Roman patron saint of lovers as well as epileptics and beekeepers. He was said to be a Roman priest and physician who suffered martyrdom - welcoming death rather than denouncing his faith - during the persecution of Christians by emperor Claudius II Gothicus in around . He is said to have died on February  of that year and Valentines Day has been celebrated since approximately the th century.While the Welsh also celebrate Valentines Day, there is the Welsh equivalent - celebrating St Dwynwen - three weeks earlier on January . It is a popular celebration among Welsh speakers in the land, but it is becoming more widely popular across Wales, with the people of Wales professing their love to their loved ones in January.MORE NEWS:Who was St Dwynwen St Dwynwen was a Welsh princess who lived in the fourth century in what we know now as the Brecon Beacons National Park. She is the Welsh patron saint of lovers ndash despite being quite unlucky in love herself.She was said to be the prettiest of King Brychan Brycheiniogrsquos  daughters and fell in love with prince Maelon Dafodrill. To her dismay, her father had already arranged for her to marry someone .She was so upset and begged God to make her forget her love. During her sleep, she was visited by an angel carrying a sweet potion that was designed to erase all memory of Maelon and turn the prince into a block of ice.God then gave the princess three wishes. She first wished that her prince be thawed. Her second wish was that God meets the hopes and dreams of true lovers. Her final wish was that she should never marry.God granted her these three wishes and as a mark of thanks, she devoted her le to him, becoming a nun and founding a convent on Llanddwyn, located off the west coast of Anglesey. Remains of the church ndash which had a well named after Dwynwen ndash can still be seen today. The well and convent became a place of pilgrimage after her death in AD. Visitors believed that the sacred fish or eels in the well could foretell whether the visitors relationship would be happy and whether love and happiness would be theirs.She is also the patron saint of sick and injured animals. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a commentOrder byOldest firstNewest firstHighest scoredLowest scoredLoading comments...

Mr Skoczylas needs to raise pound, to make sure he can run a sustainable travelling coffee business with a custom-made vehicle.ldquoI have no choice but to get it replaced because I need to provide for my family, and I canrsquot do that effectively with a broken bike, he said.After he put out an appeal via GoFundMe last weekend, he was astonished to receive more than pound, in two days. That figure now stands at just more than pound,.ldquoItrsquos overwhelming and something Irsquom incredibly grateful for, especially as times are so tough at the moment for so many people, he added.ldquoI invest so much money in it because I really believe in the idea, and this has shown me how much my community believes in me too, which is really lovely and humbling.ldquoSo many people have been unbelievably kind to me.ldquoBetina at Brod sent me a personal message of encouragement, and a man stopped me in the street to tell me hersquod seen me in the Penarth Times and that he loved what I was doing.

They feel abandoned, locked down in flammable homes and facing ruinous costs for repair work and interim safety measures.The National Cladding Taskforce proposed by Labour would be modelled on the approach adopted in Australia and would seek to urgently carry out an audit to establish the extent of dangerous materials on buildings.Six demands have been set out by the party towards fixing the issue, including providing immediate up-front funding to remove deadly cladding and setting absolute deadlines to make homes safe.They also include creating new laws to protect leaseholders from being passed historic fire safety costs, protecting leaseholders and taxpayers by pursuing those responsible for putting cladding on the buildings, as well as stamping out rogue builders by reforming the sector. vw,vw,px, px\"Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer has urged the Government to lsquoget a griprsquo of the cladding scandal The party has also said the Government should work with lenders, insurers and other industry leaders to ensure residents can sell and remortgage.Sir Keir said: ldquoI urge Conservative MPs to vote with us in Parliament todayand put their constituentsrsquo safety and security first.ldquoAnd I urge the Government to get a grip of this crisis through a national task force and by implementing Labourrsquos six demands.Earlier this year, the Grenfell inquiry was temporarily suspended as a result of the national lockdown in England.Hearings were due to begin after the Christmas break on January  but have now been pushed back until at least February, when it is hoped that evidence can begin to be heard remotely.A Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesman said: ldquoLeaseholders shouldnrsquot have to worry about the unaffordable costs of fixing safety defects in high-rise buildings that they didnrsquot cause ndash and should be protected from large-scale remediation costs wherever possible.ldquoWe all want to see homes made safer, as quickly as possible and backed by our pound. billion funding we are making good progress on remediating unsafe homes.ldquoThe Building Safety Bill is the appropriate legislative mechanism for addressing these issues and will be brought forward in due course..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Labour urges Government to create national task force on cladding article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He leaves a huge gap but his enormous contribution, enthusiasm and positivity will not be forgotten.Des was born in Drogheda in the Republic of Ireland but, whilst still very young, moved to NI where he grew up and was educated. He attended Portadown College before moving to Queen’s University Belfast in  to study German. He graduated with a First Class Honours Degree four years later, which included a year in Freiburg im Breisgau, a city where he made many le-long friends.Des’ first teaching job was back at his alma mater, Portadown College, where he taught German and French between  and . Keen to satisfy his thirst for travel, widen his knowledge of other cultures and experience teaching in other countries, he moved to Uganda in  where he taught French and German at the Aga Khan Secondary School, Kampala for two years. \"Des Johnston in his younger years.Des then ed to County Armagh where he was appointed Head of Modern Languages, again at Portadown College. It was during this time that I had the good fortune and privilege to be one of Des’ pupils. Des was ahead of his time. He recognised the importance of integrating language and culture.In spite of the passage of  years, I remember very clearly the lesson where he set up the screen and projector, cutting edge technology in the s, and showed us slides of his tour on a scooter through France, Luxembourg and Germany. As a class of  year olds, we were transfixed. Des was an example of Dali’s “true artist”, as two years later Keith, George and I packed our rucksacks and followed Des’ tracks, not on a scooter but by train. Des’ inspiration did not stop there as I was to follow his path to a degree in languages at Queen’s, a PGCE and a career in teaching. I was certainly not the first or the last of Des’ pupils to do this. It is striking that Des’ son, Philip, also followed in his dad’s footsteps, working in Germany for three years, studying in the Czech Republic and qualying as a German interpreter – without doubt a chip off the old block. Des knew how to manage a class. He had presence he got lessons off to a fun start he always progressed from what we knew, gave us confidence and self-belief and made us curious to learn more. Lessons were fun. Time flew by. We felt that we were achieving. Motivation was not an issue. He got the very best from each of us. Des was a master of the art of teaching.In  Des’ itchy feet took him to Luxembourg where he spent two years working as a translator for the European Commission. During this time he also won two caps for the national rugby team of Grand Duchy.Keen to pass on his pedagogical skills and knowledge and to champion modern languages teaching and learning, he joined Her Majesty’s Inspectorate, Department of Education, Northern Ireland in . We all feel apprehensive about the visit of the inspector. Des was not to be feared, however. His focus was always on the supportive and the formative. His aim was always to help and guide and build the confidence of those he visited. Des’ distinguished career did not end when he retired in  but rather took a gentle turn. He continued to teach with the University of the Third Age and at Millburn Primary School where he taught English and English as a Foreign Language to Polish children, a role in which he found particular enjoyment and fulfilment.Des was born to teach and so very many of us, across the world, have benefited from his skill, encouragement and warmth. Teaching was not his only passion, however. I have already mentioned his rugby caps for Luxembourg. He also excelled at the shot put in athletics and played badminton and table-tennis. He loved music, good food and reading. Des could talk convincingly and engagingly on a very wide range of subjects. He was knowledgeable, interested and interesting. He was a wonderfully entertaining raconteur, the perfect dinner guest.I feel very honoured to have been able to stay in contact with Des from the time I left Portadown College until a month before he sadly died. He and I always thought it an amazing but lovely coincidence that, in the small world that is language teaching, the boy who was to become his future son-in-law, Chris, was one of my pupils in the school in the north-east of England where I first taught.I was not the only former pupil to enjoy his wisdom, guidance, mentoring, support and friendship for many years after leaving school. I was one of a large number across continents. Des was always generous in investing time in people. He cared.

As a result, Cllr Baxter’s proposal passed with  votes in favour, eight against and one abstention recorded.However, upon discussion of the committee meeting’s minutes at December’s meeting of full council, Councillor Liam Mackle proposed that Council did not accept the recommendation put forward by the committee.This proposal was seconded by his party colleague Councillor Paul Duffy.Councillor Pope said it “was very important” that the occasion is marked and noted the need for education and cultural events to be spread throughout the borough.He also expressed his concerns about budgets and the idea of a large event taking place giving the current pandemic.“I would propose we accept the original recommendationfrom the November committee that listed the programme, including the £, budget,” said Cllr Pope. This proposal was seconded by his party’s group leader, Councillor Eoin Tennyson.Speaking about the issue, Cllr Tennyson said the programme had been discussed atand explained, from his perspective, initialdiscussions were constructive.“All parties engaged with a view to marking the centenary in a way that was inclusive and respectful,” said Cllr Tennyson. “I think the original recommendation that was presented by officers to the committee was one that did that.“It would allow us to mark the centenary in a way that was inclusive and reflective of the entire borough and also balanced against the need to be prudent in terms of the financial situation we as a council and indeed many of our rate payers are in.“I can’t in good conscience support a proposal that would see this council commit to an additional £, unbudgeted spend. The reality is that money is going to have be found through the estimates process.“We could end up in the situation where that money will have to be found through a rates hike or cuts to services. I think Councillor Pope’s proposal is an eminently sensible one and I hope all parties can see it in themselves to support that approach.”DUP councillor Darryn Causby sought clarity on what was being proposed andthe proposals tabled complied with standing orders.“Under standing order .. there should only be one amendment moved and discussed at one time, the same applies for proposals on the floor,” said Cllr Causby.“There was one on the floor, Cllr Pope then put a second one on the floor but can I please get clarity on the first one [Cllr Mackle’s proposal] it seems to be a direct negative of what is in the papers and under standing orders I am not clear on whether that is acceptable.“The other point I would raise is the budget was actually agreed at the November council meeting and we just ratied that a short time ago.“If someone is not happy with that, I suggest they look through standing orders and bring a rescinding motion to change that decision.”At this point Council’s Lord Mayor, Councillor Kevin Savage informed members he needed to speak with Council’s Chief Executive Roger Wilson and muted his microphone.Following his confidential discussionwith Mr Wilson, the Lord Mayor confirmed the budget had already been agreed before putting Councillor Mackle’s proposal, to reject the recommendation put forward by the committee, to the floor.All unionist councillors present voted against the proposal as did the three members of the Alliance Party. The members of Sinn Fein and the SDLP voted in favour of the proposal.With the votes totalled, the proposal was defeated with  members voting against the proposal and  voting in favour.The Lord Mayor then explainedthat as the recommendation of the committee stands, a rescinding motion would be requiredbefore Cllr Tennyson’s proposal could be heard.Councillor Tennyson said he was not sure he agreed with this interpretation.“The proposal was that we proceed with the programme originallyproposed by officers not the budget,” said Cllr Tennyson.“The budget may have been agreed, the programme has never been agreed therefore a rescinding motion is not required.“We have proposed that we proceed with the originalprogramme as proposed to the economic development and regeneration committee, it just so happened to be at a cost of £,.“I would be quite keen for that to be voted on as I do not share the analysis that a rescinding motion is required for a decision that has never been taken.”Councillor Baxter then said that as a matter of process given that Cllr Mackle’s proposal has fallen by “default the recommendation goes through”.“I do note Alliance are quite clearly trying to claw back as they could not bring themselves to vote for the celebration of Northern Ireland at the last committee meeting,” said Cllr Baxter.“By the very fact Cllr Mackle’s proposal has failed this recommendation from the committee is going through.”The Lord Mayor said that was his understanding as well and the recommendation as it stands has now gone through.A proposal to accept the minutes of the committee was put forward by Councillor Brian Pope and seconded by SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon.Editor’s message:Thank you for reading this article.

The latest figures show a total of , first doses and , second doses – bringing the overall number of vaccines administered to , Today’s figures provide a further indication of important progress in the roll-out of vaccines to combat the virus. In addition: * Mobile vaccination teams have administered first doses in all of Northern Ireland’s care homes - and second doses to over % of the homes. * We have vaccinated % of the  year olds and over, and have started to vaccinate  –  year olds through the GP programme. * Online booking was opened on Wednesday night for - year-olds to book their vaccination appointments in one of NI’s seven regional vaccination centres. In the first  hours of the online portal, , people had booked their vaccination jabs. Intensive work has been undertaken to address teething problems with the online system, linked to high levels of demand. * A further signicant consignment of the Astra Zeneca vaccine is due in NI next week, for immediate distribution to GPs. This will help facilitate a rapid acceleration of vaccinations for those over  and patients who are Clinical Extremely Vulnerableto Covid-. * In another important development on the vaccine front, a large-scale UK trial for a new coronavirus vaccine indicates it to be .% effective against the virus. The Novavax vaccine is expected to be available across the UK in the second half of this year,approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency  People in Northern Ireland have played a key role in the development of Novavax. Nearly  participants were recruited from Northern Ireland for the trial which was led locally by researchers from Queen’s University Belfast and the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Health Minister Robin Swann said: “I want to thank everyone working on the vaccination programme right across Northern Ireland. “This is a massive logistical exercise and I am very encouraged by the strong start we have made. It should be remembered that the first Covid- vaccine approval was only announced last month, with the second approval coming some four weeks later. We have made great strides forward since then. “There will inevitably be frustrations along the way. We will get to everyone - we are getting to thousands more each day.” Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride thanked everyone involved in the Novavax trial. He said: “The rapid development of Covid- vaccines is our long-term route map out of this pandemic. We should be rightly proud that Northern Ireland continues to play its part in the historic global effort to develop new drug treatments and vaccines. Throughout our response we have all come together in support of each other. We continue to see the benefits of the partnership between academia, health and industry and this another example.” The Department of Health this week announced a twin track approach to accelerating NI’s vaccination programme - ensuring more people can take up the offer of vaccination and help protect themselves against Covid-. GPs will be focusing on the  plus age group with the Astra Zeneca vaccine, while the seven regional vaccination centres will in parallel be offeringPfizer vaccination appointments to - year-olds. The plans are to offer everyone over  in NI a vaccine by the end of February. People who are Clinical Extremely Vulnerableto Covid- are also a priority for February. GPs will be vaccinating a large proportion of CEV patients.
