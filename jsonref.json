Labour’s Stephen Kinnock). By contrast Mr Robbins’s voice was as soft as margarine. He was deferential. He bit on the lower lip, did lots of nodding and flashed a pair of dimples, working rising inflections into his tone. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and his stand-in Sir Mark Sedwill, along with civil service chief executive John Manzoni, speak in almost an identical way.John Whittingdale (Con, Maldon) claimed that ‘most ministers knew nothing’ of the soft-Brexit plan pulled out of the Chequers hat.Mr Robbins, meekly: ‘I don’t think so.’ He claimed Mrs May’s ‘engagement with colleagues was constant’. Constant but deceptive, perhaps.Mr Whittingdale said it looked as if Mrs May had tried to ‘circumvent’ her Cabinet. Mr Robbins, who began most of his answers with ‘so’, said ‘it’s certainly not a picture I or the Prime Minister would recognise’.    Theresa May’s head of the Europe unit at number 10 Downing Street Olly Robbins was undergoing a spot of parliamentary scrutiny today. He has been given powers that arguably usurp those of HM Secretary of State for Brexit, Dominic RaabMr Robbins’s enhanced powers were confirmed in a parliamentary written answer published a few minutes before yesterday’s committee hearing.It confirmed a ‘change of government machinery’ which all but emasculates the Brexit department.Craig Mackinlay (Con, S Thanet) said: ‘I feel a coup d’etat has been going on.’ Mr Robbins: ‘So, Mr Mackinlay, I honestly don’t recognise the picture.’Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con, NE Somerset) wondered when Mr Robbins had started writing his Chequers papers. ‘These papers had their origins in other papers,’ said Mr Robbins. See how sneaky they are at this sort of thing? He finally conceded that the first versions of the Chequers papers were written ‘about a fortnight’ earlier.Mr Rees-Mogg, with deadly politeness, said he did not hold Mr Robbins responsible for a ‘worrying’ breakdown in Cabinet government. Mr Robbins thanked him. Mr Rees-Mogg now said that he blamed Mrs May. Mr Robbins gave a pale gulp, wishing he had not been so quick to thank the Mogg.It is often said Tony Blair lied to ministers and to Parliament when he took us into the Iraq War, and that his dishonesty wrecked public trust in our political system.If Mrs May has just misled her own ministers, on a national strategic relationship with the EU which may impede our economy for decades, her reputation will sink as low as that of the sharply hated Blair.

However, the deep-level lines are older and too narrow.This means that there is not only no space for air conditioning units, but also for hot air to escape properly. Another issue is the fact that there is a lot of clay surrounding the deep-level line tunnels, which traps hot air extremely well and results in the high temperatures recorded on the likes of Central and Bakerloo lines.However, in the early 2020s Piccadilly, Central, Bakerloo and Waterloo \u0026amp City lines will have 250 new trains with air-cooling. Who is Yanet Garcia? \u0027World\u0027s sexiest weathergirl\u0027 dumped by boyfriend FaZe Censor revealedHow to apply for Love Island 2019Jason Spencer: Georgia lawmaker revealed after appearance on Sacha Baron Cohen\u0027s Who is America?Thierry Henry\u0026#8217s net worth revealed after Arsenal legend \u0026#8216agrees\u0026#8217 to take Aston Villa manager jobWhat will happen when Prince Philip dies?Who is Joshua Kushner?

Yesterday he did so. Last afternoon of term. Convenient.Physically, Mr Robbins is a commanding presence: tall, bull-necked, strong hair, wide shoulders. He wore a smart suit, his black shoes dazzlingly polished. He sat alongside Dominic Raab, new Brexit Secretary (predecessor David Davis having quit at Mr Robbins’s interferences).Anyone judging Raab and Robbins simply on looks might have presumed that the latter was the politician, for he bore himself with the greater pomp.

Raab was husky, lawyerly enough to see off nitpickers (eg. matinee favourite Joanna Cherry of the SNP), at other moments quite impressively brusque with low-grade pointscorers (eg. Labour’s Stephen Kinnock). By contrast Mr Robbins’s voice was as soft as margarine. He was deferential. He bit on the lower lip, did lots of nodding and flashed a pair of dimples, working rising inflections into his tone. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and his stand-in Sir Mark Sedwill, along with civil service chief executive John Manzoni, speak in almost an identical way.John Whittingdale (Con, Maldon) claimed that ‘most ministers knew nothing’ of the soft-Brexit plan pulled out of the Chequers hat.Mr Robbins, meekly: ‘I don’t think so.’ He claimed Mrs May’s ‘engagement with colleagues was constant’. Constant but deceptive, perhaps.Mr Whittingdale said it looked as if Mrs May had tried to ‘circumvent’ her Cabinet. Mr Robbins, who began most of his answers with ‘so’, said ‘it’s certainly not a picture I or the Prime Minister would recognise’.    Theresa May’s head of the Europe unit at number 10 Downing Street Olly Robbins was undergoing a spot of parliamentary scrutiny today. He has been given powers that arguably usurp those of HM Secretary of State for Brexit, Dominic RaabMr Robbins’s enhanced powers were confirmed in a parliamentary written answer published a few minutes before yesterday’s committee hearing.It confirmed a ‘change of government machinery’ which all but emasculates the Brexit department.Craig Mackinlay (Con, S Thanet) said: ‘I feel a coup d’etat has been going on.’ Mr Robbins: ‘So, Mr Mackinlay, I honestly don’t recognise the picture.’Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con, NE Somerset) wondered when Mr Robbins had started writing his Chequers papers. ‘These papers had their origins in other papers,’ said Mr Robbins. See how sneaky they are at this sort of thing? He finally conceded that the first versions of the Chequers papers were written ‘about a fortnight’ earlier.Mr Rees-Mogg, with deadly politeness, said he did not hold Mr Robbins responsible for a ‘worrying’ breakdown in Cabinet government. Mr Robbins thanked him. Mr Rees-Mogg now said that he blamed Mrs May. Mr Robbins gave a pale gulp, wishing he had not been so quick to thank the Mogg.It is often said Tony Blair lied to ministers and to Parliament when he took us into the Iraq War, and that his dishonesty wrecked public trust in our political system.If Mrs May has just misled her own ministers, on a national strategic relationship with the EU which may impede our economy for decades, her reputation will sink as low as that of the sharply hated Blair.

These are made in a two-step process. \u0027First of all, a very small tunnel is carved out by melting water, so a little water causes a stream which carves its way through the ice initially.Climbers walk across a small patch of snow on Ben Nevis (right), which is looking a lot less white than in March 2015 (left)    It was nice and cold in the tunnel on Ben Nevis  for the climbers, who had to keep moving to stay warm\u0027Once the water has burrowed its way through the ice, it makes a small tunnel and that allows the warmer air to access it and the warmer air starts to melt the ice so that the tunnel gets bigger and bigger.\u0027The tunnel is formed by a combination of water and air, the process can take weeks and sometimes even months to form a very big tunnel.\u0027Mr Cameron writes a yearly report for the Royal Meteorological Society, where he surveys how much snow is left on the mountains, as a hobby.The mountaineer said: \u0027I go up there several times a year and I need to make a judgement call to decide when to go.           The size of the tunnel was a big surprise and was caused by higher temperatures melting water and hotter air getting inside it          Iain Cameron (not pictured) was undertaking a report for the Royal Meteorological Society on the snow in the mountains\u0027Basically, what I am looking for is how much snow is left because what I am interested in is when the snow all disappears.

The word alone evokes a boundary, a crossing, a limit of known experience beyond which discovery and danger lurk. In the emptiness of the frontier, we find characters reduced to their most basic selves, the comforts and trappings of the modern world stripped away to leave them with startlingly elemental choices: death or survival morality or corruption love or hate. We also find them pitted, more often than not, against their environment. Whether hostile or benign, the landscape becomes a character in itself.In my case, the frontier was the Australian outback. Only Killers and Thieves is set in a dark period of colonial history, on the late 19th-century Queensland frontier, where two young brothers are drawn into a quest for retribution that will define both their relationship and their lives. In writing the book, I travelled with them through a beautiful yet brutal terrain. Perhaps that is also part of the frontier novel’s appeal: in our ultra-connected world there is nowhere that can’t be visited, either in person or online – but these stories can still transport us to distant times and places and make them urgently real.So here are 10 great frontier novels, roughly in order of when they’re set:1. Blood Meridian by Cormac McCarthyMcCarthy is one of the great chroniclers of the American frontier and its inhabitants. I could have just as easily chosen The Road, or the Border Trilogy, but for me Blood Meridian is his masterpiece, a tale of murder, pillage and (bare) survival in the lawless USMexican borderlands, written in McCarthy’s poetic, near-biblical signature style. Often hailed as one of the great American novels, it is a staggering work.2. The Son by Philipp MeyerMeyer’s multi-generational novel about a Texan oil family is rooted in the legend of the patriarch, Eli McCullough: from his childhood on the Texan frontier, to his capture and raising by Comanches, reluctant return to white society, and the empire he founded on the plains. A stunning, meticulously researched book that is epic in scale, ambition, and historical sweep.3. True History of the Kelly Gang by Peter CareyFrom the scant pages of notorious Australian outlaw’s Jerilderie Letter, Peter Carey crafted the voice of Ned Kelly and wrote his life story in the bushranger’s wry and poetic vernacular a voice so convincing we cannot fail to believe it is indeed all true. Which is the point, of course: Kelly is such a compelling storyteller that he could say just about anything and we would fall for it, reading on breathlessly and no doubt laughing along.4. News of the World by Paulette JilesThis elegant and deceptively simple tale of an ageing former army captain attempting to return a 10-year-old girl to her family, is a moving and insightful road novel set on the Texas frontier. Jefferson Kidd leads a content, if lonely life, reading newspaper stories aloud in far-flung towns, when the girl, Johanna, reluctantly “rescued” from a Kiowa tribe, is placed in his care. What follows is a convincing and moving story about their growing bond, and a subtle investigation of US politics at that time.5. Wake in Fright by Kenneth CookA chilling outback horror and an Australian classic, first published in 1961 and still in print. Placid teacher John Grant finishes the term at his isolated bush primary school and heads to Sydney for the holidays but, on a stopover in the mining town of Tiboonda, loses his money on a game of two-up and finds himself sucked into an inescapable nightmare by the all-too-friendly locals. Never has the offer of a drink been so dangerous.6. Into the Wild by John KrakauerNot a novel, but I’m including it anyway, because the true story of Christopher McCandless has haunted me since I first heard it. This is perhaps because he lived out a fantasy many of us have shared: after graduating college, he gave away everything, burned his credit cards and cash and set out into the Alaskan wilderness to live a simple life on the land. The tragedy that unfolds is one of youthful folly, hubris, bad luck, inspiration and courage. 7. Legend of a Suicide by David VannVann’s work returns again and again to the American frontier, in this case Alaska, where, in a series of short stories and a novella, a son bears witness to a father falling apart. It’s the central novella, Sukkwan Island, that dominates: the pair set up home in a wilderness hut for what is supposed to be a period of bonding and clean living, but becomes something much more shocking and dark. A poignant collection, all the more so for the true story behind it.8. The Shepherd’s Hut by Tim WintonWinton is known for writing about landscape and place, but also about adolescence, characters on their own personal frontiers. The figurative and the literal combine in his latest novel, out this month, as young Jaxie Clackton runs away from home and walks through the Western Australian desert and salt flats, in search of hope, survival and love. The voice is arresting and vivid, and the story superbly told.9. The Natural Way of Things by Charlotte WoodTen women are drugged and imprisoned in an outback compound, having each been involved in a sexual scandal with a powerful man. Presided over by brutal guards and forced into hard labour under an unrelenting sun, the tables are turned when the power goes out and the women are forced to fend for themselves. A blistering, furious novel about gender, power and sexuality that is also an engrossing battle to survive.10. The Book of Strange New Things by Michel FaberFrontiers aren’t just earthbound: science fiction and post-apocalyptic fiction are brimming with stories about survival in, or the discovery of, new worlds. Here, Faber’s genre-bending novel tells an affecting love story about a missionary sent to teach Christianity to the alien inhabitants of a barren colonised planet, while his wife lives through an accumulation of natural disasters on a struggling Earth. Multilayered and moving, in a brilliantly realised world."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d905e5b54d272aff3efab069f9d20b47a687777a/0_153_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54bbb2ed13cdf37c1a60952e9aa547af","title":"britain politicians child poverty coalition conservative","story":"There was a time when the battle to reduce child poverty was pretty dominant in public policy. Each year at budget time, commentators would watch to see how much the government would give to reduce child poverty what new scheme and initiatives would be brought in how many billions would be dedicated to this fight. The Institute for Fiscal Studies and other experts would track what impact the latest announcement might have. Charities would debate whether it was enough (and it never was).That, of course, was in the New Labour years. Latest figures suggest it worked, with the number of children living in poverty falling from 3 million in 1998 to 1.6 million in 2010. Yet now, as new Resolution Foundation analysis has shown, child poverty levels are on the rise again. There were 4.1 million children living in poverty in the UK in 2016-17, according to Child Poverty Action Group. And it seems like nobody particularly cares. How then have we come to this?Much of the answer is to do with politics. People often like to say that all politicians are the same – but child poverty shows just how wrong that is. The last Labour government saw reducing child poverty as one of its touchstones – even if its importance at any one time, relative to keeping middle England happy, was often fiercely debated between No 10 and No 11. The fight against child poverty was seen as both a social and moral imperative but also about economic policy – allowing more people to participate in the economic life of the country.But even before Brexit swamped everything else we were in a bad place on the child poverty agenda. From 2010, the new government’s decision to make the need for austerity the overwhelming narrative relegated issues such as child poverty to something, at best, to sort out later. In both the coalition and then Conservative government periods, even those who cared about the topic would not put it high enough up their agenda to demand serious sustained action. And in opposition, Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour has not made ending child poverty its rallying cry, with a more general desire to end austerity and take many key services back into public ownership dominating: as many pointed out, the 2017 Labour manifesto had surprisingly little in it for those at the bottom of the pile.Key also to the Labour government’s success in bringing down child poverty was a willingness to get money directly into the hands of those with children who were in poverty. By definition, children are in poverty because their families don’t have enough income: give them money through tax credits, targeted financial support, and increasing child benefit and you will have impacts. Yet that rather obvious point is anathema to many on the right, even the socially concerned. They argue that it is just a sticking plaster, that combined with the targets that Labour gave itself – to reduce child poverty by half by 2010 – it created incentives to use cash transfers to push people just over the poverty threshold and ignore the real underlying issues.Of course we must work on preventive policies to avoid families ever getting into poverty, be they about education, skills, housing or health issues. But in truth, since 2010 we have seen little substantial action in these areas and in any case, it should never be an excuse for not acting to help people in need now.So this is the key ingredient: political choices. But Gordon Brown was also savvy enough to know that the British public were always a bit ambivalent about child poverty. Did it really exist? Were British kids starving – as that was what poverty instinctively means to most, however much policy experts pushed the concept of relative poverty. And if they were, wasn’t it all about their ne’er-do-well parents?Part of the Labour strategy therefore was to produce a coalition of charities, faith groups and concerned people, including those on the centre right, to highlight the issue. It was almost as though we were creating a pressure group to make us to do the right thing. And that political pressure is a key part of creating momentum for action.When I moved to my current job, working with charities and funders, I asked many children’s charities why they had gone so (relatively) silent on child poverty. Many said that they had to use their resources sensibly and that lobbying a government that was never really going to respond in a substantial way was not a good use of money. That was perhaps a rational response, but it is surely time now to get angry about what is happening and to say it loud and clear. Child poverty is a scar on our society – but we know from experience that we can do something about it if we really want to.• Dan Corry is the chief executive of New Philanthropy Capital and a former Downing Street and Treasury adviser to the Labour government"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e9252020ee92c3bfc08d43bee19853dd4e2c7fd/0_569_2652_1591/master/2652.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2df4e2df29fdf284006fe30301cbc577","title":"girls female scientists jess wade wikipedia stem role models","story":"As Dr Jess Wade, postdoctoral researcher in plastic electronics at Imperial College London, continues her mission of adding women in science to Wikipedia, she highlights a key problem with many “women into science” projects: a lack of evidence that they work. “There’s so much energy, enthusiasm and money going into all these initiatives to get girls into science. Absolutely none of them is evidence-based and none of them works. It’s so unscientific, that’s what really surprises me,” she says.You wouldn’t know it from marketing campaigns such as EDF Energy’s Pretty Curious competition or IBM’s #HackAHairDryer campaign, but there’s a solid body of research from which advocates can draw inspiration. We know that, for example, role models play a crucial part in developing girls’ and women’s interests. Studies by Girlguiding UK have shown that girls value role models and that a lack of role models puts them off careers such as engineering. And a psychologist, Penelope Lockwood, found that women needed female role models to illustrate that success was attainable.By adding more pages to Wikipedia, Wade is expanding women’s representation on one of the most-read websites in the world. It’s a noble mission that mirrors the work of projects such as TrowelBlazers, highlighting women in archaeology, palaeontology and geology, and Ada Lovelace Day, an annual global celebration of women in science that I founded, which has featured many Wikipedia “edit-a-thons” over the last 10 years.There are so many amazing and inspiring women in science that it’s hard to choose between them. But here are five whose work and achievements make them great role models for us all.The only British woman to have won a Nobel prize for science, Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin was among the first to use X-ray crystallography to reveal the structure of antibiotics, vitamins and proteins such as cholesterol, penicillin, Vitamin B12 and insulin. Her work established X-ray crystallography as the best way to investigate the properties and functions of many biological molecules. Crowfoot Hodgkin understood the importance of computers, including many programmers in her research team and, in 1959, persuading Oxford University to buy a Mercury computer. She was awarded the Nobel prize in Chemistry in 1964.Dr Patricia Bath’s Laserphaco Probe is a medical device to remove cataracts, one of the leading causes of vision loss and blindness. In 1981, Bath began working on a design that used a laser instead of ultrasound, making the process less invasive, faster and more accurate. Bath patented her idea in 1988, becoming the first African-American woman to receive a medical patent. The Laserphaco Probe also removes diseased corneas, and Bath used it to restore sight to a woman who had been blind for more than 30 years.Professor Tu Youyou is a pharmaceutical chemist who won the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2015 for her discovery of the drugs artemisinin and dihydroartemisinin. Her drugs have been used to treat 200 million malaria patients, saving millions of lives. In 1967, Tu began testing more than 2,000 herbal recipes in her search for a new anti-malarial drug. Her breakthrough was using cold water, instead of hot, to prepare an extract of qinghao, or sweet wormwood. After successful animal tests, Tu volunteered to be the first human subject.Known as the Shark Lady, Dr Eugenie Clark was the founding director of the Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida, and a prolific and inspirational writer. Clark proved that sharks can learn simple tasks, discovered that the Moses sole secretes an effective shark repellent and debunked the myth that sharks need to swim to breathe. Clark pioneered the use of scuba ing in marine biology and continued her research well into “retirement”, learning to pilot a sub when she was 87.During the 1960s space race, Yvonne Brill developed a more lightweight, accurate and flexible propulsion system for communications satellites. She combined hydrazine, a propellant that gives off heat when it decomposes in the presence of a catalyst, with the resistojet, a thruster that heats a propellant, vaporising it and creating thrust from the gas’s expansion. She began her patent application for the electrothermal hydrazine thruster in 1967. Although the patent was granted in 1974, it wasn’t until 1983 that Brill saw her invention tested. It’s now an industry standard.With more and more businesses recognising that they’re missing out on this kind of talent because women are dissuaded from pursuing science careers, there’s a temptation to pour money into more marketing campaigns and stunts. But what’s really needed is for companies to take a more rigorous, evidence-based approach and to work with, and fund, those in the field who already know what works and what doesn’t.Girls and women don’t need gimmicks to get into science they need year-round access to resources, role models and support.• Suw Charman-Anderson is the founder of Ada Lovelace Day, an international celebration of the achievements of women in Stem"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ba375f9aa4bf67759b6a85bb1d5b31dfd7314e66/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=823f134057a5e4fb6690f06d827d524e","title":"cold bath cold shower heatwave","story":"If you’re reading this, it’s probably because you’re hot. In which case, as concepts go, this one will be music to your ears. Or rather balm for your sunburn.The heatwave has created a need for cooling off that extends beyond a cold shower – and so the current trend for coldness in the world of wellness, beauty and exercise feels timely given that for years it’s been all about Bikram yoga, hot-cloth cleansing and saunas. But is this penchant for the cold more than a whim? Or is it simply the latest fad to be commodified by the wellness industry?Extolling the virtues of being cold is actually nothing new. Cold bathing, ground-zero of the movement, dates back to Hippocrates, with the proposed benefits as murky as any plunge pool – cold showers purport to increase circulation, reduce stress, kickstart your immune system and release endorphins as well as cooling you down. I started finishing my hot shower with an icy blast after a friend who takes cold showers every morning told me he had never felt better. Parking the science for a moment, the benefits were clear from the off. It follows the theory set by the French epigrammist Nicolas Chamfort: “a man should swallow a toad every morning to be sure of not meeting with anything more revolting in the day ahead”. In short, it’s rooted in unpleasantness but that’s precisely why you do it the rest of the day is a breeze from there.Even cold yoga is carving out a similar niche. Brrrn, a new fitness studio in Manhattan, which opened in May, has a yoga class performed in 16C (61F), as well as setting its gym temperature at 7C (45F). At Frame in London, yoga classes are now routinely taken with the door open, where the emphasis used to be on retaining heat.And then there are ice-rollers, designed to help de-puff your skin and reduce redness, although an ice cube may well also do the trick. “I’m reluctant to say coldness will actually change your skin, but it’s obviously pleasant to have cold things on your face,” says the skin expert Dr Mervyn Patterson. “And you could argue that if you have swelling under the eye, a cold compress might help.”In many ways, it feels like a fad. The wellness industry has blown up exponentially in the past few years – and dichotomising consumers and changing trends are good for business. There are those that follow an eight-step cleansing routine. And those who pride themselves on paring it all down and going back to nature.If this explosion feels out of step with feminist discourse – all the lotions and potions that are packaged, however covertly, towards making a “better you” – then it is possible coldness has sprung from the same well that being cold is the pinnacle of a pared down, natural – even macho – wellness. Wim Hof, the Dutch wellness guru, has a cult-like status for suggesting cold-body therapy is the key to good health.We will be sorry when the heatwave has gone, of course. But until that day comes, until the grass turns green and the sea returns to its icy norm – until this heatwave is over – thank goodness coldness is all the rage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0674bc637f1ae5cd43b8ea1c28b7a8c07967bcc3/0_122_3660_2196/master/3660.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b64f56e6c590b0f1b5501d21869c4833","title":"newcastle fans ultimatum rafael benitez","story":"Newcastle United is as famous as it is infamous, revered just as it is ridiculed. What is universally accepted, however, is that there is never a dull moment on Tyneside.Many label Newcastle supporters as self-entitled, fickle and hard-to-please, while others (myself included) remain undeterred in maintaining that, in spite of years of disappointment, it remains one of the sleeping giants of English football. As of late, you would be more inclined to think of it as less asleep and more in a coma.Frustrations have once again begun to bubble on Tyneside and a new fan-led movement has emerged above the trenches at St. James’ Park: #IfRafaGoesWeGo. Spawned from of a toxic brew of anger and fear, Newcastle fans up and down the country have threatened to renounce their support for the club if Rafael Benítez is forced out this summer.At the centre of this protest, and like all good soap operas, the hero versus villain narrative is fulfilled by two key players: the malevolent tyrant Mike Ashley and man-of the-people, Benítez. Rafa’s disarming modesty, his symbiotic relationship with the fanbase and his all-round majesty has generated a renewed hope and cause for pride in our football club, something which has been missing for a long while. In the two and a half years since the Spaniard’s shock unveiling as manager – arriving just months after vacating arguably the biggest footballing seat on the planet – he has guided a motley crew of relegated misfits to the Championship title at the first time of asking and returned the club to the top 10 of the Premier League all the while turning a £19m profit in the transfer window.However, rumours have emerged in recent weeks that Ashley is refusing to release transfer funds to Benítez until he commits to a contract extension. Benítez, now accustomed to the false-promises and misgivings of the United hierarchy, is supposedly delaying signing an extension until he has seen sufficient evidence to support his and the fans’ ambition.Having been promised investment this summer by Ashley regardless of the ongoing status of a possible takeover, Newcastle have mustered up just one new addition to the squad, with Ki Sung-Yueng arriving on a free from Swansea (Kenedy and Martin Dúbravka have also returned to the club after finishing the season with Newcastle last May). Outside of that, the club have generated at least £15m from the sales of Mikel Merino and Chancel Mbemba.When you consider that the club’s transfer record has stood for 13 years – the £16m spent on Michael Owen in 2005 – it is hardly surprising why such unsatiated ambition has starved us of positivity for so long, leading to fans on social media involving themselves in a “brand hi-jacking” campaign, swamping social media posts by Sports Direct and Mike Ashley’s PR agency of choice, Keith Bishop Associates, with disparaging comments.Whilst some people might turn their nose up at fan-led protests, there is no denying the purpose or intent behind it. Victor Hugo famously said “not being heard is no reason for silence”, and this mantra could not be truer of the Newcastle fanbase.Indeed, the message has been so loud and clear that Newcastle Central MP Chi Onwurah delivered a petition to Parliament on Tuesday to prevent Ashley from his continued exploitation of the team. “The House of Commons urges the Government to prevent unscrupulous football club owners from exploiting clubs, their fans and local communities with particular reference to Mike Ashley and Newcastle United football club,” she said.It is not uncharacteristic for fans to be left in the dark as transfer and takeover dealings are often brokered discreetly behind closed doors and by lesser-known administrators. What is perhaps most frustrating this time, however, is that for the first time in a long while we have something to cherish in Benítez – a manager who we adore and who returns that adoration in equal measure. If mismanagement and miserly incompetence threatens that, then expect the fans to roar.As this Shakespearean tragedy trudges on, we have to hope that this most recent episode is one of the last under Ashley’s calamitous and damaging reign. The peripetieas of the drama have been excruciating, scandalous and downright embarrassing at times, and a change in ownership couldn’t come sooner.Crucial to our ongoing survival and, whisper it, flourishing in the top-flight, is the magnanimous, majestic, Benítez, whose continued faith in the club and the fans, in spite of all else, is remarkable. He is so much more than a great manager: he is hope. He is the thread by which the fan base is hanging, and if he goes, we go.It may be a cliché to hark back to the Geordie-coined ‘we don’t demand a team that wins, but a club that tries’ mantra but, quite frankly, I don’t care. Ashley’s 11-year reign at the club has amounted to a series of unfortunate clichés and it’s high time we got off that train of wearisome disappointment.Harry Savill is editor of The Spectator’s View, a Newcastle United fanzine"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f5de65af36b893b45d12c223d4a213ada2efcd44/529_349_4967_2980/master/4967.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76e28a2ca85315519c0bdeb2accf4220","title":"the fiver malcom barcelona roma","story":"Sign up now!

But just like the good people of Swappers Close, what started as a bit of fun has left some broken hearts along the way. Because until Monday evening, it very much looked like Malcom would not be theirs, having promised himself to Roma. So much so that his former club Bordeaux had released a statement saying Malcom was heading to Italy, Roma confirmed the news too and a bunch of people with nothing better to do were waiting at Rome airport to clog the terminal up for weary travellers and welcome their new signing to town.Looking like a cross between a politician being grilled about a ropey government contract and a pet owner appealing for the safe return of their missing cat, Monchi continued to be utterly perplexed that a club and player, with no binding agreement in place, would decide they’d rather sell and move to one of the world’s very biggest clubs. “If someone wants to come to Roma that is great, but ultimately if they do not want to come to Rome then we do not want them.”But he’s not taking it lying down!

While supporters appreciated the work and trophies Antonio Conte provided, there was a realisation – even before their victory in the FA Cup final – that his position had become untenable. Conte had lost the dressing room after a series of disagreements with the playing staff and Sarri had been identified as his successor some time ago.Sarri’s appointment represents a real departure from Conte’s more reactive approach and Chelsea fans can expect to see sweeping changes in playing style and formation – if not personnel. The delay in bringing in their man has hampered his chances of imparting his philosophy before the season begins, though the signing of former Napoli midfielder Jorginho will be a key step in that direction.A switch to a 4-3-3 formation is in the offing, which will mean deserting the three-man defence that helped Chelsea win the league title under Conte. It remains to be seen how well the players will suit the new shape. Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso were ideal wing-backs in the old system, while Cesar Azpilicueta adapted to the role of a right-sided centre-back superbly, becoming the team’s most consistent performer. The Spaniard may revert to his old right-back position but that would strip the side of their most reliable centre-half.It’s little surprise that Sarri is shopping for an upgrade in central defence, then. His net has been cast almost exclusively in his homeland and even more specifically than that if Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis is to be believed. The club’s outspoken owner says Sarri wanted to “take my whole team to England and dismantle it” and that he had to “lay down the law” to Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia after approaches for a number of Napoli players.Napoli centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly was a target for Chelsea but De Laurentiis says he has rejected “a €100m bid from the Premier League”. Both Leonardo Bonucci of Milan and Daniele Rugani of Juventus are on Sarri’s wishlist as he looks for a defender who can play out from the back.Napoli passed teams to death at times last season. Their average of 676 short passes per game was second only to Manchester City (699) last season in Europe’s top five leagues. They would work opponents with a long period of possession before springing into incisive, often one-touch passing moves. This approach requires the right midfield. Jorginho will sit as the fulcrum of the side, meaning that N’Golo Kanté will probably take a No6 role, which could give him slightly more freedom to join attacking moves as he did so successfully at Leicester. Fitting the newly crowned World Cup winner into the side will be easy, but Tiemoue Bakayoko is probably too wasteful for Sarri’s liking.Cesc Fàbregas may need to adapt his game to find a place in the side. He is very similar to Jorginho, so may be pushed into an advanced, creative role in the midfield three – if he has the legs for the job. Ross Barkley will be hoping to make that position his own as he attempts to relaunch his career at domestic and international level.If reports are to be believed, both Fabregas and Barkley could be competing with Sergej Milinković-Savić for the goalscoring midfielder role Marek Hamsik played so well for Napoli under Sarri. Milinković-Savić scored 12 goals from the left of a midfield three at Lazio last season. A triumvirate of Jorginho, Kanté and Milinkovic-Savic would give Sarri a true blend of physicality and creativity.Elsewhere, the club may need to replace goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois should he leave for Real Madrid. Eden Hazard and Willian have also been linked with moves to Spain, even though both forwards would fit into Sarri’s favoured front three formation very naturally. There could even be opportunities to experiment with Hazard’s position. His Belgium team-mate Dries Mertens excelled under Sarri at Napoli when he moved into a central role, something that might also suit Hazard.That said, Sarri’s set-up still requires a striker, with Álvaro Morata struggling for form and Olivier Grioud already being touted as a departure. Gonzalo Higuaín would fit the bill, especially after Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo. Higuaín enjoyed remarkable success under Sarri in Naples. They had just one season together at the Stadio San Paolo but Higuaín was unstoppable in that 2015-16 campaign, breaking the Serie A goalscoring record with 36 goals in 35 appearances. A move to Turin followed and, despite scoring 40 goals in his two seasons with the Italian champions, another move would make sense for both clubs and the player.If Sarri were to bring in Higuaín and complete his puzzle, Chelsea could be a real force this season. Things are going to be very different at the Bridge and fans are understandably excited about the new direction. They will not be distracted by the lure of potential Champions League glory, which will give Sarri more time to concentrate on bouncing back in the league.It seems managing Chelsea is an Italian job nowadays. Their last three coaches from the peninsula have lifted major trophies in their first seasons – Carlo Ancelotti’s double in 2009-10, Roberto Di Matteo’s triumph in the Champions League in 2012, and Conte’s league title last May.Sarri offers the prospect of a brand of football the fans have not seen at Stamford Bridge, but his legacy will be judged on silverware and even that doesn’t offer job security at Chelsea. Combine the attacking football the board have craved for many years with trophies and Sarri could yet become the manager who leaves on his own terms.• Follow WhoScored on Twitter and Facebook• Follow Martin Laurence on Twitter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f12aa9f2a75145e4bf16a09c7125f5ef51d3a1c8/3_0_10661_6400/master/10661.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d595165f05204b9d5773587893919f76","title":"fish oil hype health planet supplements study no benefit","story":"Omega-3 is one of our favourite supplements – but a huge new study has found it has little or no benefit for heart health or strokes. How did it become a $30bn business?The omega-3 industry is in a twist. Again. Last week, Cochrane, an organisation that compiles and evaluates medical research for the general public, released a meta-analysis – a study of studies – to determine whether or not omega-3 pills, one of the world’s most popular dietary supplements, reduced the risk of coronary heart disease. After comparing 79 trials involving 112,059 people, the researchers could find “little or no difference to risk of cardiovascular events, coronary heart deaths, coronary heart disease events, stroke or heart irregularities”.I can’t say that I was particularly surprised. Over the past 15 years, more than 20 studies have shown a similar lack of effect. But what does surprise me is how we continue to look at the world of fish and seafood through the amber lens of a fish oil capsule. Omega-3s do something in our bodies – and probably something important. But without the larger context of the marine organisms that contain them, omega-3s get lost in the noise of human metabolism and modern marketing.The confusion arises in part from the historical baggage of fish oil and the $30bn (£23bn) industry associated with omega-3 extraction. Once upon a time, fish oil solved a major human health problem. But it had nothing to do with coronary heart disease. During the Industrial Revolution, a disease became increasingly prevalent throughout northern Europe: rickets. Malnourished children in sunlight-poor urban slums often ended up bowlegged by adolescence. Researchers eventually pieced the puzzle together and concluded that the disease was caused by a deficiency in vitamin D, which the body naturally generates in the presence of sunlight. And, as it turned out, vitamin D is stored in high amounts within the liver of codfish.A Norwegian pharmacist named Peter Möller seized upon this finding (and many other anecdotal stories about the curative properties of cod-liver oil). Using a patented chemical process, he arrived at a product that, he announced to the world, “didn’t taste fishy”. Möller and his advertising team then launched a campaign to institutionalise the regular use of cod-liver oil, regardless of whether you were at risk of rickets or not. The campaign was a success: a spoonful a day became common practice. Möller built his company into an international presence and died in 1869 with 70 cod-liver oil steam factories to his name, churning out 5,000 barrels of the stuff a year. By the time omega-3s started to be a focus of medical research, there was already a rosy feeling around fish oil.In the early 1970s, the chemist Hans Olaf Bang read in a Danish journal that there were extremely low incidences of cardiovascular disease in Inuit communities of Greenland. He and his assistant, Jørn Dyerberg, travelled to Uummannaq on the north-west coast of Greenland to investigate. At the time of the expedition, Bang didn’t quite know what he wanted to test for. They probed and palpated 130 local people, measured height and weight, and came home with a lot of blood.“We had these 130 precious samples of blood,” Dyerberg told me in his lab in Copenhagen recently. They estimated that in 20 years, the traditional Inuit diet would have changed to the western diet, and Dyerberg remembers Bang saying: “‘There will never be anyone who can do this again, so let’s do whatever we can!’ And we decided to do fatty acid analysis.”The result of their analysis was a hypothesis that is an exemplary “association study”. In an association study, multiple factors are logged and a hypothesis of correlation is drawn from the findings. In the case of the Bang and Dyerberg Inuit study, they found that: 1) Inuit people in Greenland had a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids and blood lipid levels of omega-3s much higher than their western contemporaries. 2) Inuit people also had, according to public health records, markedly lower rates of coronary heart disease. They hypothesised that therefore 3) omega-3s might reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.This was backed up by further laboratory studies that did show, in vitro, that omega-3s were involved in anti-inflammatory reactions. But – and this is a big but – while correlations abound for omega-3s and heart disease, the real trouble has always been in showing causation. That is where this latest round of studies comes in.The Cochrane study and the others that preceded it have one thing in common: they are meta-analyses of “randomised control trials” (RCTs). That is, trials where patients are given a supplement at random and tracked over time against another set of patients given a placebo. Most statisticians consider these trials to be the very top of the evidence pyramid. But it is these studies that have at times proven troublesome for Omega World. Each time RCTs come to light that show little or no effect, Omega World tends to blend its counterargument with evidence from association studies because, as a recent industry reply to the Cochrane report put it, “it’s all connected”.When it then turns to the RCTs, the industry, as would be expected, looks for different explanations as to why positive health outcomes weren’t reported. In the burst of RCTs preceding Cochrane, the Omega World line was that these most recent trials did not show benefits because things such as statins, stents and other forms of cardiovascular intervention masked the anti-inflammatory effect of fish oil pills earlier RCTs had shown a fairly significant effect, but none of those treatments existed at the time of those trials.The industry also, and I believe rightly, pointed out that studies often failed to look at omega-3 blood lipid levels before and after supplementation. In other words, it’s not really a fair trial if you don’t know where the patients started with respect to the omega-3 levels in their blood. If we only measure effect without looking at omega-3 levels in the blood at the outset, aren’t we doing the dietary equivalent of testing how far a car can drive without checking how much petrol is in the tank at the start?With Cochrane, the latest industry argument is that the study’s authors cut out a number of different forms of cardiac ailments, thus skewing the stats. In particular, it notes that Cochrane failed to include “sudden cardiac death” and “sudden cardiac mortality” in its list of outcomes. Since nearly half of all patients first report heart disease to their doctors by suddenly dropping dead, this is not an insignificant exclusion.But the fact that the industry’s arguments shift with each new, damning meta-analysis gives you pause. What is going on? Is there an international conspiracy to discredit omega-3s? Or does Omega World keep moving the goalposts? When I posed this question to Ellen Schutt, the executive director of the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s, probably the world’s most prominent omega-3 advocacy organisation, she made it seem as if the problem didn’t even exist. “As a matter of fact, we track media sentiment … and have found many more positive omega-3 stories than negative, in general. Of course, the negative stories are the ones that catch people’s attention. As we both know, negative stories are much more interesting and the media is definitely guilty of sensationalist ‘clickbait’ headlines such as: ‘Omega-3s don’t work.’”As sympathetic as I am to the trials of Omega World, as studies continue to poke holes in aspects of the omega-3 cardiovascular argument, I can’t help thinking there is something else going on. Because, while the fish oil supplement business is a big deal, it is also a sheen on the surface of a much deeper pond. Long before omega-3 supplements became popular, an industry arose that used the same omega-3-rich creatures not for medicine, but for an odd array of agricultural and industrial purposes.Ultimately, it was this so-called “reduction industry” that created the oily-fish extraction system that now consumes millions of tonnes of marine wildlife every year. Today, one in every four kilograms of fish caught is reduced into oil and meal and used for agriculture, land animal husbandry and, most recently, fish farming, AKA aquaculture. The reduction industry has appeared in different forms under different ownership over centuries of human history. In the 18th century, it targeted whales, reducing northern hemisphere cetacean populations into isolated pockets of endangered species in order to make lamp oil and lubricants. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, it shifted to the southern hemisphere, reducing 390,000 of the 400,000 great whales that once roamed the Southern Ocean to margarine, nitroglycerine and other “marine ingredients”.Each decade brings a different use for all those anchovies. In the 1940s, they were used for fertiliser. In the 50s and 60s, chicken feed. In the 70s, pet food and pig feed. In the 80s and 90s, aquafeed for salmon and other carnivorous fish. And now, the most elite product of the reduction industry: dietary supplements.And it is not just Peruvian anchoveta that are reduced into fish meal and oil. All told, the reduction industry removes from the ocean 20m-25m tonnes annually – the equivalent of the combined weight of the population of the United States. The omega-3 industry argues that some vendors are turning to much more sustainable options, such as algae-based omega-3s and fish oil reclaimed from recycled byproducts.Nevertheless, the reduction industry marches on into new territory. Most recently, it has begun targeting Antarctic krill, the keystone prey species of the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Two years ago, when I asked the then chief executive of the largest krill extractor in the world why it had launched a $200m fishing operation in the Southern Ocean to take food out of the mouths of whales, he noted that krill oil is a “phospholipid” and making it much more “bioavailable” means that consumers can take a much smaller pill. Why was this important? Consumers who chose krill oil over fish oil would be much less likely to suffer the horrors of a fishy burp.Amid all the conflicting reports, there is one bit of data that shines out: fish and seafood can bring considerable health and environmental benefits. Fish, in addition to providing us with omega-3s, delivers protein with far fewer calories than meat: 100g of salmon contains 139 calories and 23g of protein. By comparison, 100g of beef contains 210 calories and 20g of protein.Harvesting wild fish from well-managed stocks requires a fraction of the carbon as farming terrestrial livestock. Similarly, fish farming puts a lesser burden on the Earth in terms of carbon and freshwater use than pretty much any form of terrestrial animal husbandry. We could make the farming of fish even more carbon- and resource-efficient if we used alternative ingredients for fish food based on algae and food waste. And if you consider growing “filter feeders” such as mussels, clams and oysters, the benefits are even more extreme. These bivalves don’t have to be fed anything, and make water cleaner even as they grow fatter. They provide protein 30 times more efficiently than cattle.Is the epidemiological evidence for fish-eating better than simply taking a fish oil pill? Again, we are stuck with the problem of correlation versus causation. It is very difficult to feed someone a fish in such a manner that they don’t know they are eating a fish. Hence an RCT of seafood-eating hasn’t really ever been done. Most of the studies around seafood are association studies. And, while one such study associated eating fish twice a week with a possible reduction in mortality of 55,000 lives a year, we don’t know what a fish-eater does with the rest of their life beyond eating fish.But what we do know is this: the omega-3 industry and the reduction industry that bred it removes fish from the water in a way that doesn’t put protein on our plates – it just puts pills in our cupboards. Is this the way we want to continue to do business with the planet?• The subheading of this article was amended on 25 July 2018 to clarify that it was for heart health or strokes that the study found omega-3 had little or no benefit.

Traditionally, they’re poached, rather than baked, though the same rules apply: add the sugar to the egg whites before whisking, as Michel Roux Jr’s book The French Kitchen suggests, and the resulting foam will be dense and firm fold it in at the end, as Koffmann recommends in his book Classic Koffmann, and it’ll be softer, but hard to work with. Best, I find, to beat the egg whites until they hold soft peaks, as Anthony Bourdain’s recipe in Les Halles Cookbook dictates, then gradually beat in the sugar a little at a time, to give a firm, yet light result. Caster sugar dissolves more easily than David Tanis’ granulated variety in the New York Times, though, making the finished meringues less inclined to weep moisture as they cool. Tanis also stabilises his meringue mix with cream of tartar, which feels like wise insurance even if you’re not using coarse sugar, especially if you’re not sure of the age of your eggs (older eggs whip up better, because the protein networks are looser and more amenable to the addition of large amounts of air).They can’t compete with the poached sort for lightness, though – and, really, it’s not a hard technique to master. First, I’d strongly recommend not trying to cook too many at once: these fragile icebergs have a wide turning circle, and an annoying tendency to stick together in the pan if they come into contact with each other. A wide pan is preferable to a tall, narrow saucepan for the same reason. I try covering the pan to avoid the need to turn them in the first place, as in Tanis’s recipe, but though this technique yields excellent early results, they rapidly deflate as soon as I lift the lid a cautious flip proves more successful.Second, and even more important, these are not Ottolenghi-style, billowing beauties, but foamy little quenelles of featherlight pleasure – they will deflate as they cool, for the same reason a soufflé or yorkshire pudding will, but bear in mind this is a homely pudding designed to taste, rather than look impressive (though, frankly, to these British eyes, it still does).Many recipes poach the meringues in milk, then thriftily reuse it in the custard. My problem with this is that, while I don’t think it makes a discernible difference to the finished meringues, it does mean you have to make them before the custard, even though that takes far longer to cool down, and with a dessert this sweet, you really do want it cold, rather than just cool. Simmering milk also has a tendency to form a skin as soon as you take your eye off the pan, which then clings to the meringues – water, by contrast, does not.I feel on safer ground here: custard in its various preparations would be a strong contender for my specialist subject if Mastermind ever came calling. This is a very French version: elegantly thin (though, as Koffmann cautions, it must be viscous enough to support the meringue) and ridiculously rich, with enough sugar to put you off eating more than your fair share.Berry’s version, the least sweet of the lot and the only one to rely on the thickening power of a little cornflour, is my favourite, though I concede you don’t strictly need the cornflour unless you’re feeling nervous the same goes for Tanis’s bain marie. I do like his cardamom and lemon peel-infused milk, however, even if vanilla is de rigueur in the classic preparation – and if you’re feeling particularly decadent, you might want to cut the milk with a little single cream to make a British equivalent of his suggested “half and half”.Though you shouldn’t need to strain your creme anglaise unless you’re worried the Michelin inspectors are in town, I do highly recommend plonking the finished custard in a sink of cold or iced water to ensure it’s refreshingly cool – David Lebovitz even chills his bowls before serving. (Berry butters hers, though I can’t for the life of me work out why.)Roux makes a strawberry compote to go with his îles flottantes, and Tanis poaches cherries in a rose syrup, both of which are utterly delicious with yoghurt, but rather too sweet for our taste when paired with the meringue and custard. If you’d like some fruit in the bowl, I think some baked rhubarb would go very nicely – l’entente cordiale in dessert form.Nuts are a common garnish, and Koffmann goes one step further with pink praline almonds, which “bring a nice crunch and the colour looks pretty”, but they’re hard to get hold of in this country – and, again, very sweet. His suggested alternative of pistachios or toasted almonds, also used by Berry and Bourdain, prove more popular, adding crunch without extra sugar – unlike the caramel that’s widely used in restaurants. If you’re a sugar fiend, though, it’s very easy to add – once you’ve portioned out the puddings, heat 150g sugar in a pan until a rich brown, then drizzle over the top. Repent at leisure.4 eggs500ml whole milk1 vanilla pod, split, or a dash of vanilla extract120g caster sugar1 tsp cornflour (optional)¼ tsp cream of tartar1 pinch salt2 tbsp flaked almondsSeparate the eggs, putting the yolks into a medium heatproof bowl and the whites into a large, scrupulously clean one. Set this aside while you make the custard.Pour the milk into a medium saucepan and add the vanilla. Bring to a simmer, then turn off the heat and leave to infuse for 10 minutes. Bring back to a simmer. Meanwhile, whisk 40g sugar with the egg yolks and cornflour, if using, until dissolved. Put the bowl on a damp kitchen towel near the hob (this helps anchor it) and half-fill the sink with cold water.Remove the vanilla pod, if using (give it a quick rinse, dry well and use to perfume a jar of sugar). Pour half the simmering milk over the yolks, whisking all the time, until well combined, then pour back into the milk pan. Cook over a low heat, stirring constantly, until thick enough to coat the back of a wooden spoon – when you draw your finger down the spoon, it should leave a clear line. Take off the heat. Pour the custard back into the bowl and put it in the sink to cool, stirring occasionally.To make the meringues, add the cream of tartar and a pinch of salt to the egg whites, then beat to soft peaks. Gradually add the sugar, still beating, until it’s all incorporated, then carry on beating until the mix is shiny and stiff.Bring a wide, shallow pan of water to a boil and line a baking tray with kitchen paper. Scoop a generous amount of meringue mixture on to a dessert spoon, then push off into the water with a second spoon to make a kind of egg shape. Do this until the pan is a third full, poach for two minutes, then very carefully flip over and poach for two minutes more. Gently scoop out with a slotted spoon and slide on to the tray. Repeat with the remaining mixture, then leave to cool. Toast the almonds in a dry pan until golden.To serve, ide the custard between bowls, top with two meringues apiece, scatter the almonds on top and eat while they’re still nice and cool.• Îles flottantes or oeufs à la neige: do they bring back happy holiday memories, or do you prefer creme brulee or custard tart?

He said on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he had listened to Hodge being interviewed on Monday, adding: “I realised there was a complete misinterpretation of the code, so I can understand why she was so angry if that’s what she believed this code had done.”Hodge, who is Jewish and lost relatives in the Holocaust, has said she stands by her comments, though she denies swearing at Corbyn in an angry confrontation in a Commons corridor last week after Labour’s national executive committee refused to abandon its new code of conduct on antisemitism.The code includes the internationally accepted International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of antisemitism, but does not replicate in full a list of examples of antisemitism published by the IHRA alongside its definition.McDonnell said that both Hodge and Corbyn had been upset by the incident.“Jeremy was deeply upset because, when you have someone haranguing you in that way, of course it’s upsetting,” he added. “Those sorts of accusations, when he has worked so hard on the issues of antisemitism and anti-racism, of course he’s upset.” Labour’s general secretary, Jennie Formby, has written to Hodge telling her she faces investigation for “abusive conduct” and that “any further behaviour of a similar nature” could result in disciplinary action.McDonnell said Corbyn agreed that the case should be settled swiftly rather than subjected to the full disciplinary process.“At the weekend I spoke to Jeremy and said we’ve got to resolve this matter quickly,” said McDonnell. “He said, yes, we’ve got to do that, and he’s asked the chief whip and general secretary to try to sort this out. We want it resolved amicably and I think that can be done.”Labour averted a  showdown with MPs over its code of conduct on Monday, with a vote on whether the party should adopt the international antisemitism definition deferred until parliament returns in September.At the PLP meeting, sources said a number of Labour MPs spoke strongly in favour of adopting the IHRA definition, with an objection raised by the former deputy prime minister John Prescott."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/07df245c4b89b482ef0b3ce667132d6a20dcfb39/0_303_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1b984b29264b440a663fc8a54db37f9a","title":"brexit uk cannot afford not to have a deal says irish government politics live","story":"Rolling coverage of the day’s political developments as they happenThis is not just about stockpiling.

What is your reaction to those stories?Fox says over the last two years there have been a remarkable number of scare stories about Brexit. The UK is still attracting a great deal of investment, the economy is growing, order books are doing well. The “economic apocalypse” did not materialise.He says these scares are like the ones raised about TTIP, the US-EU trade treaty.He says the people propagating these myths are anti trade and anti capitalism.Fox says opponents of Brexit are now treating the EU referendum as just consultative, not as an instruction to government.Q: How closely do you expect the UK to align with the EU on free movement of people after Brexit?Fox says the government rejected an EEA option because it would require accepting free movement.He says voters do not mind people coming to the UK if they work and pay taxes. But at the time of the referendum they did object to migrants being able to access services if they were not working. That is why they rejected free movement.He says his personal preference would be for companies to be able to bring in the skilled workers they need from wherever.Fox says, when Juncker meets Trump, he would like to see a “de-escalation over tariffs”.Q: Has the US administration said it will notify Congress before Christmas that it wants to start negotiating a new trade deal with the UK?Fox says the UK government is starting its own consultation so that it can match that sort of timeframe.Fox says the UK cannot negotiate a free trade deal until after it has left the EU. If anyone is in any doubt, they should know the UK is leaving, he says.Fox says the fact that Jean-Claude Juncker, the European commission president and an unelected bureaucrat, is in Washington today negotiating trade on behalf of of the UK, is exactly why he wanted to leave the EU.Q: What do you say to those who argue that you need a hard Brexit to get the best chance of a trade deal with the US? And do you see Trump as a protectionist or a free trader?He says what the relationship with the EU will look like depends on whether we get “a people’s Brexit or a bureaucrats’ Brexit”.He says the US has always been a free trading country. It is no secret that London has a difference with the US over tariffs. But there are many issues on which they agree, he says.Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, has just delivered his speech in Washington. It was a fairly standard defence of free trade. But he is now taking questions.Asked about a trade deal with the US, Fox says talks with the US administration have been going on for months. He has had constructive meeting on this visit.We are moving forward with our preparations.He says he does not know what the final relationship with the EU will be. But the UK cannot wait, he says.He says he was “very encouraged” by what President Trump said about the future relationship when he visited the UK.Speaking to reporters after the British-Irish intergovernmental conference, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister, said that any “prudent’ government would be preparing for a no deal Brexit. He went on:You have to put vim and vigour into it because you want to make sure that you have thought through all potential problems and you have got a contingency plan, which in that situation would work and deliver the best outcome in those circumstances.“Vim” has become a new government buzzword. When Dominic Raab, the Brexit secretary, went to Brussels last week, he promised to push ahead with the Brexit talks “with renewed energy and vigour and vim”, to the confusion of some non-Britons, who weren’t familiar with the term, according to one report."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a102ba810e779cf6d86b04c1bbe930cd5bd6b924/0_129_3508_2105/master/3508.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7268d8d33be88fa32ea859ef678e55cb","title":"huge underground lake discovered on mars say astronomers","story":"Scientists have spotted a 12 mile-wide stretch of water underneath a slab of ice at the Martian south poleAstronomers have found compelling evidence that there is a huge reservoir of liquid water buried a mile under the ice near the south pole on Mars.Radar measurements taken from the European Space Agency’s Mars Express orbiter spotted the 12 mile-wide stretch of water at the base of a thick slab of polar ice in a region known as Planum Australe.It is the first time that researchers have identified a stable body of liquid water on the red planet. The finding raises the likelihood that any microbial life that arose on Mars may continue to eke out a rather bleak existence deep beneath the surface.“We discovered water on Mars,” said Roberto Orosei at the National Institute of Astrophysics in Bologna. Any other explanation for the bright reflections the scientists saw in their radar observations was “untenable”, he added. Details of the finding are reported in the journal, Science.Today, the most obvious signs that Mars was once a wet world are the ancient waterways that sculpted the planet’s surface many millions of years ago. In 2015, Nasa announced that it had spotted water seeping down slopes and gullies on the planet, but that interpretation was cast into doubt last year when US Geological Survey researchers argued that the mysterious dark streaks were no more than tumbling grains.For the latest discovery, researchers in Italy analysed three years of data gathered by an instrument called the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding, or Marsis, onboard the Mars Express probe. The measurements, collected between 2012 and 2015, show that radar waves penetrated the clear ice at the Martian south pole but reflected strongly off a body of water that lay beneath.John Bridges, a professor of planetary science at the University of Leicester, who helped locate the final resting place of the UK’s Beagle 2 lander on Mars, said the scientists had made a convincing case for liquid water on Mars. “It’s a careful analysis of the data. There’s certainly a good basis for it,” he said.Elena Pettinelli, a scientist on the team at Roma Tre University, said it was impossible to know whether the body of water was a lake or an aquifer where the water filled interconnected pores in Martian rock. If it is an open body of water, it may resemble Lake Vostok, the largest subglacial lake in Antarctica, she said.Nor can the scientists tell how deep the water is. The radar pulses from the Marsis instrument bounce back off the water but don’t reach the bottom of the reservoir. The best the scientists can say is that the water is at least a metre or two deep.What they do know is that the water is extremely cold. At the bottom of the ice at the Martian south pole, the temperature is estimated to be about -68C. Though far below zero, the water is thought to remain liquid because it is under pressure and rich in salts, in particular magnesium, calcium, and sodium compounds known as perchlorates, which are readily found on the surface of Mars.While hardly ideal for life as we know it, the briny fluid could potentially support microbes which have adapted to such salty conditions. The challenge any Martian microbes would face is resisting the osmotic potential which acts to draw water out of cells and leave them in a desiccated heap. “This is certainly not a very pleasant environment for life,” said Orosei. Though not an expert in the harsh extremes that life can endure, Bridges suspects the salty conditions in the Martian water might be too much to survive. “I think it’s really, really stretching the envelope of potential life to bursting point,” he said.Mark Sephton, who researches life in extreme environments at Imperial College, London, said that the water being so far under the surface of Mars was not in itself a problem for life. The surface of Mars is bombarded by intense radiation that effectively sterilises the surface, so if life lurks anywhere on the planet, it is likely to be underground. “As long as there is an energy source to exploit and a source of nutrients or raw materials then life is possible,” he said.“High salt conditions are good for maintaining a liquid state but are a challenge for life. If the salt concentrations outside of the cell are higher than the inside then it draws water out from inside the cell and the cell shrinks and desiccates. Life can adapt by synthesising organic molecules to stop the process but there are limits, beyond which the high salinities in the cell interfere with biochemistry and the cell dies,” Sephton added. “So for Mars, some mechanisms which keep water in a liquid state can operate at levels that are too much of a good thing for life.”It may be some time before scientists can investigate the water under the Martian south pole to see if any life lurks there. “Getting there and acquiring the final evidence that this is indeed a lake will not be an easy task,” said Orosei. “It will require flying a robot there which is capable of drilling through 1.5km of ice and this will certainly require some technological developments that at the moment are not available.”For now, the researchers will search other sites on Mars for signs of more subterranean lakes or aquifers. Writing in the journal, the authors say: “There is no reason to conclude that the presence of subsurface water on Mars is limited to a single location.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/75edae67209a9e80daa259256afd6b291a0a00b3/0_28_4497_2699/master/4497.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4fb03f07a42e448bd074b6816c56620","title":"sebastian vettel mistakes adding up missed championship","story":"Ferrari’s No 1 driver knows he is under scrutiny after missing out at Hockenheim as last two years show a worrying trendSebastian Vettel said he is at “peace with himself” despite the baying hounds of the Italian media turning on him after his mistake at the German Grand Prix cost Ferrari a win. For this intelligent and grounded driver it is a familiar mantra he has employed previously. Indeed, it was a response that was entirely expected which suggests he is having to use it too often. In a tenacious battle for the world championship with Lewis Hamilton, it appears to be that in moments of pressure, Vettel has been found wanting.Taking a pounding in the press of Ferrari’s home nation comes with the territory in a red car. But it was that Vettel’s crash in the wet at Hockenheim while leading was self-inflicted, that seemed so exasperating.“His mistake is devastating and could be why Ferrari loses the world championship,” La Gazzetta dello Sport forebodingly wrote. La Stampa said: “The German has made at least four mistakes in 11 races. The talent of the world champion is not questioned, but his exaggerated zest is hurting Ferrari’s season.”Four mistakes this season would include his grid penalty for impeding Carlos Sainz in qualifying at the Red Bull Ring and some have cited the clash with Max Verstappen in China, which is unfair. Having given the Dutchman room, he was not to blame when Verstappen clouted him.He has, however, made five high-profile mistakes in just over 12 months and all were misjudgments at moments of great intensity.In June last year with Hamilton leading in Baku, the red mist descended when, believing he had been brake-tested, he barged into his car. A 10-second stop-go penalty ensued and it would have been costly in points but for Hamilton having to stop again because of a loose headrest.At Monza Hamilton had taken the championship lead for the first time in 13 races. At the next round in Singapore, where Mercedes struggled, Vettel had to make the most of it. Qualifying on pole with Hamilton in fifth was perfect. What followed was not. Faced with a charge from Max Verstappen and Kimi Räikkönen off the line he moved across to defend, the three clashed, all were eliminated. Hamilton went on to win. With a title at stake, playing the percentages and going wide would have been wiser but for that exaggerated zest. The result gave Hamilton a 28-point lead and he took the title.This season the fight is even closer but ambition has again outweighed the long game. In Baku he was too aggressive on the restart and went wide, converting second place to fourth. Once again Hamilton won. Then in France he was too hot into turn one, locked up and hit Valtteri Bottas. Hamilton won, the German was fifth. All were moments of high pressure, all ended up costing Vettel and then there was Germany.He has never won at Hockenheim but grew up close to the circuit and wanted to deliver at home. Here was a cauldron partly of his own making but one intensified by Hamilton’s charge from 14th. After his pit stop Hamilton was 24 seconds behind, seven laps later he had halved the gap. But the German still had track position and likely the race if he kept it on the island, yet overcooked into the Sachskurve and it was over in a moment.He is a keen student of the sport and may later have considered when Jochen Rindt pressured Jack Brabham into an error on the last lap at Monaco in 1970. Certainly there were shades of the mistake he made when hounded by Jenson Button on the final lap at Canada in 2011 which cost him the win.“I don’t need pity. It was my fault,” he said of Germany. “When everything goes well you are cheered, and if you make mistakes you are criticised. So I don’t care much about what people say. I have to be at peace with myself.”Unfortunately the errors are being played out against Hamilton’s performances. Hamilton, for all that he wears his heart on his sleeve and is a passionate, emotional driver, can be ruthlessly clinical. Every facet was on display in Germany. Here then was his heartfelt response to his qualifying setback, saying: “I will die before I give in”. Which he followed with an inch-perfect march though the field and albeit with a little luck, to the win.If anything the pressure on the British driver, facing losing more points in the title fight, was greater. He had done similar at Silverstone and repeatedly throughout his career. Until his mechanical DNF at Austria he was on a 33-race points-scoring streak. Certainly he has flaws but has also shown time and time again almost flawless judgment in when to move, when not to and doing it clean.Vettel’s talent is manifest. The old cliché that he could not overtake is a nonsense he has repeatedly disproved, not least on Fernando Alonso through Curva Grande at Monza. He told the  in Austria: “Of course I am excited at times and feel the adrenalin – anybody who has played sport or competed, it is part of racing.” Which is understandable and he has four titles but these last two years have been the most intense he has faced in competitive terms and the question they have raised is whether he should be quite so at peace with his decision making.It may well be what decides the title this season, as Italy’s Corriere della Sera noted. Describing Hamilton’s race as a “masterpiece of assertiveness and concentration”, it added: “The behaviour of the two star drivers makes the difference.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da3ec1d63771f1dc6bd442dd85c49eca6bf9aea4/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ccc62b4a6bd77a43a4b569160a31429","title":"turning up the heat sport struggle temperature rises","story":"It’s great weather for pétanque. Or fishing, provided you can find the water. With the planet gritting its teeth through a heatwave comparable to Martha and the Vandellas sharing a vindaloo in a sauna, playing sport comes with new challenges. In fact, even the thought of it is enough to break out in a sweat.To speak for a moment in a personal capacity, playing five-a-side right now is a nightmare. You start off bombing around desperate to prove you’re still young, then quickly hit a wall. This is not the ordinary wall constructed from the reality of your lack of fitness, but a wall that has wheels and wants to run you over. Your face suddenly becomes a radiator, your legs two stacks of greasy plates. Your entire body is caught in a trap as the heat bounces down from the sky and back up off the polypropylene grass. Almost immediately the survival instinct kicks in and you remodel your game from marauding midfielder to defensive libero for whom the ability to read the play is much more critical than the ability to actually run.There are upsides to being active in the heat. I take pleasure from accruing a salty crust across my face and returning home like I’ve just washed up from a shipwreck. Other people, with different physical qualities, may even enjoy the experience wholesale. Whichever way you feel about it, however, you can’t carry on as you would if it were a more typical 20 degrees with a gentle breeze and unrelenting drizzle.So people start to adapt. The first change is carrying a water bottle. It’s de rigueur. As with all these things, what was once an incidental object is now a highly refined product designed to provoke envy in the eyes of other water bottle users. Check out this description on Amazon of one such product: “Sports Water Bottle With Motivational Time Markings – BPA Free Plastic Sports Drinking Container With Flip Nozzle, Fast water flow, No\u0026nbspresidual taste, Removable Straw And Leakproof Cap”. So as well as quenching your thirst, this bottle will\u0026nbspsurvive the apocalypse.Consumer capitalism is good in some ways. The fetishisation of gym gear that’s been going on for the past decade has actually provided us with a number of materials specifically designed to absorb and obscure unsightly puddles of sweat. But it’s interesting to note the little adjustments people are making as the heat roils around them, from the shifting patterns of the evening joggers to sudden uptick in enthusiasm for swimming (this is anecdotal, and derived partly from resentment at my inability to ever find a lane with fewer than four people cruising around it).However awkward this season may be for the average punter, it ain’t nothing compared to what the professionals have to endure. Skulking at the back fanning yourself with your hand is, for them, not an option.Over the course over this summer, it has been difficult not to sympathise with those pursuing high‑level athletic endeavours, be it on the football field\u0026nbspin Samara (no Scandinavian should have to endure\u0026nbspthat), or Centre Court at Wimbledon (it was revealed that even the pigeon-scaring hawk Rufus was undergoing a special morning bathing routine to keep him cool this year). As for the Tour de France, it takes a very special physiology to race up mountains for hours when the temperature is nudging 90 degrees. A very special one indeed.If Nigel Lawson turns out not to be right and we are in fact living a world in which the climate has been disrupted by human activity, then none of us are going to be able to carry on forever as we have to this point. And we will need more than fancy water bottles. After England’s Joe Root was hospitalised with severe dehydration after playing through temperatures in the Sydney Ashes Test that registered, on a thermometer in the middle of the SCG, as high as 57C, the ICC was criticised for not having a cut off point at which heat stops play. This is now a live issue in other sports too, with Tennis Australia recommending that matches should be suspended if the mercury goes above 34C. This is higher than the level set by the WTA but entirely at odds with the ATP, which has no allowance for heat-related breaks in the men’s game.Professional sports will have to adjust as much as any amateur clogger. It will be interesting to see what happens in the UK in particular,\u0026nbspgiven that our general response to extremes of weather (both hot and cold) seems to be to fall into a state of flummoxed panic. All will have to adapt, though, be it by doing more hot-weather training, staging more events indoors, or stitching together their own personal exoskeleton of battery‑powered fans. Watching those cyclists bombing up the Alpe d’Huez it also occurs that zips on everything would be a good idea.Walking through a local park last weekend I experienced the odd, inverted sight of the only green thing in a sea of bleached straw being a carefully maintained wicket. In the medium term everyone is going to have to adjust to a new reality, but in the short term – like a cricket fan desperate for an ill-deserved draw – I’ll be praying for rain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58e71f216812a04c30fb68557c8235b753ec3657/171_0_4919_2953/master/4919.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81c3c0e59f2421b3e306a25a50cd014a","title":"ai artificial intelligence social media bots wrong","story":"Social media has allowed self-proclaimed ‘AI influencers’ who do nothing more than paraphrase Elon Musk to cash in on this hype with low-quality, pieces. The result is dangerous In June of last year, five researchers at Facebook’s Artificial Intelligence Research unit published an article showing how bots can simulate negotiation-like conversations.While for the most part the bots were able to maintain coherent dialogue, the researchers found that the software agents would occasionally generate strange sentences like: “Balls have zero to me to me to me to me to me to me to me to.”On seeing these results, the team realized that they had failed to include a constraint that limited the bots to generating sentences within the parameters of spoken English, meaning that they developed a type of machine-English patois to communicate between themselves. These findings were considered to be fairly interesting by other experts in the field, but not totally surprising or groundbreaking.A month after this initial research was released, Fast Company published an article entitled AI Is Inventing Language Humans Can’t Understand. Should We Stop It?. The story focused almost entirely on how the bots occasionally erged from standard English – which was not the main finding of the paper – and reported that after the researchers “realized their bots were chattering in a new language” they decided to pull the plug on the whole experiment, as if the bots were in some way out of control.Fast Company’s story went viral and spread across the internet, prompting a slew of content-hungry publications to further promote this new Frankenstein-esque narrative: “Facebook engineers panic, pull plug on AI after bots develop their own language,” one website reported. Not to be outdone, the Sun proposed that the incident “closely resembled the plot of The Terminator in which a robot becomes self-aware and starts waging a war on humans”.Zachary Lipton, an assistant professor at the machine learning department at Carnegie Mellon University, watched with frustration as this story transformed from “interesting-ish research” to “sensationalized crap”.According to Lipton, in recent years broader interest in topics like “machine learning” and “deep learning” has led to a deluge of this type of opportunistic journalism, which misrepresents research for the purpose of generating retweets and clicks – he calls it the “AI misinformation epidemic”. A growing number of researchers working in the field share Lipton’s frustration, and worry that the inaccurate and speculative stories about AI, like the Facebook story, will create unrealistic expectations for the field, which could ultimately threaten future progress and the responsible application of new technologies.Exaggerated claims in the press about the intelligence of computers is not unique to our time, and in fact goes back to the very origins of computing itself.In February 1946, when the school bus-sized, cumbersome Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (Eniac) was presented to the media at a press conference, journalists described it as an “electronic brain”, a “mathematical Frankenstein”, a “predictor and controller of weather” and a “wizard”. In an attempt to tamp down some of the hype around the new machine, renowned British physicist DR Hartree published an article in Nature describing how the Eniac worked in a straightforward and unsensational way.Much to his dismay, the London Times published a story that drew heavily on his research titled An Electronic Brain: Solving Abstruse Problems Valves with a Memory. Hartree immediately responded with a letter to the editor, saying that the term “electronic brain” was misleading and that the machine was “no substitute for human thought”, but the damage was done – the Eniac was forever known by the press as the “brain machine”.It was a similar story in the United States after Frank Rosenblatt, an engineer at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory, presented a rudimentary machine-learning algorithm called the “perceptron” to the press in 1958. While the “perceptron” could only be trained to recognize a limited range of patterns, the New York Times published an article claiming that the algorithm was an “electronic brain” that could “teach itself”, and would one day soon “be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its own existence”.While the giddy hype around AI helped generate funding for researchers at universities and in the military, by the end of the 1960s it was becoming increasingly obvious to many AI pioneers that they had grossly underestimated the difficulty of simulating the human brain in machines. In 1969, Marvin Minsky, who had pronounced only eight years earlier that machines would surpass humans in general intelligence in his lifetime, co-authored a book with Seymour Papert proving that Rosenblatt’s perceptron could not do as much the experts had once promised and was nowhere near as intelligent as the media had let on.Minsky and Papert’s book suffused the research community with a contagious doubt that spread to other fields, leading the way for an outpouring AI myth debunking. In 1972, the philosopher Hubert Dreyfus published an influential screed against thinking machines called What Computers Can’t Do, and a year later the British mathematician James Lighthill produced a report on the state of machine intelligence, which concluded that “in no part of the field have the discoveries made so far produced the major impact that was then promised”.This trough of disillusionment ushered in what has since been called the first AI winter, a period in which funding for research in the field dropped off almost entirely. The media, which had drummed up so many inflated expectations for “electronic brains”, also lost interest. While there were small resurgences in the 1980s and 1990s, AI was more or less a topic relegated to the realm of corny sci-fi novelists – computer scientists often avoided the term artificial intelligence altogether for fear of being viewed as “wild-eyed dreamers”.The ice of AI’s first winter only fully retreated at the beginning of this decade after a new generation of researchers started publishing papers about successful applications of a technique called “deep learning”.While this was fundamentally a decades-old statistical technique similar to Rosenblatt’s perceptron, increases in computational power and availability of huge data sets meant that deep learning was becoming practical for tasks such as speech recognition, image recognition and language translation. As reports of deep learning’s “unreasonable effectiveness” circulated among researchers, enrollments at universities in machine-learning classes surged, corporations started to invest billions of dollars to find talent familiar with the newest techniques, and countless startups attempting to apply AI to transport or medicine or finance were founded.As this resurgence got under way, AI hype in the media resumed after a long hiatus. In 2013, John Markoff wrote a feature in the New York Times about deep learning and neural networks with the headline Brainlike Computers, Learning From Experience. Not only did the title recall the media hype of 60 years earlier, so did some of the article’s assertions about what was being made possible by the new technology. “In coming years,” Markoff wrote, “the approach will make possible a new generation of artificial intelligence systems that will perform some function that humans do with ease: see, speak, listen, navigate, manipulate and control.”Since then, far more melodramatic and overblown articles about “AI apocalypse”, “artificial brains”, “artificial superintelligence” and “creepy Facebook bot AIs” have filled the news feed daily.Lipton, a jazz saxophonist who decided to undertake a PhD in machine learning to challenge himself intellectually, says that as these hyped-up stories proliferate, so too does frustration among researchers with how their work is being reported on by journalists and writers who have a shallow understanding of the technology.What Lipton finds most troubling, though, is not technical illiteracy among journalists, but how social media has allowed self-proclaimed “AI influencers” who do nothing more than paraphrase Elon Musk on their Medium blogs to cash in on this hype with low-quality, TED-style puff pieces. “Making real progress in AI requires a public discourse that is sober and informed,” Lipton says. “Right now, the discourse is so completely unhinged it’s impossible to tell what’s important and what’s not.”Lipton is not the first person to express concern about the new AI hype cycle and where it is taking the field. Last year, the pioneering roboticist Rodney Brooks wrote an article criticizing the “hysteria about the future of artificial intelligence” for MIT Technology Review. In 2013, New York University professor Gary Marcus wrote an article for the New Yorker in which he argued that the hype will create unrealistic expectations followed by disillusionment leading to another AI winter.But for Lipton, the problem with the current hysteria is not so much the risk of another winter, but more how it promotes stories that distract from pressing issues in the field. “People are afraid about the wrong things,” he says. “There are policymakers earnestly having meetings to discuss the rights of robots when they should be talking about discrimination in algorithmic decision making. But this issue is terrestrial and sober, so not many people take an interest.”In March last year, Lipton started his own blog to try to counter-balance and deconstruct some of the most damaging sensationalist AI news. So far, he has called out a “low-quality” profile of Elon Musk in Vanity Fair and an uncritical overview of Anthony Levandowski’s so-called AI church, among others.The blog has received some attention from the media and has a regular readership, but Lipton knows that his influence is limited. “What really needs to happen is better training of journalists and more integrity,” he says. “Until that happens, my blog is just a pebble in the rapids of crap. I’m not altering the direction of the stream.”Joanne McNeil, a writer who examines emerging technologies, agrees that there is a problem with uncritical, uninquiring tech journalism, and often uses Twitter to make fun of Terminator-style articles. But at the same time, she is weary of pointing the finger solely at journalists and believes that one of the causes of AI hype is an uneven distribution of resources.“If you compare a journalist’s income to an AI researcher’s income,” she says, “it becomes pretty clear pretty quickly why it is impossible for journalists to produce the type of carefully thought through writing that researchers want done about their work.” She adds that while many researchers stand to benefit from hype, as a writer who wants to critically examine these technologies, she only suffers from it. “There are few outlets interested in publishing nuanced pieces and few editors who have the expertise to edit them,” she says. “If AI researchers really care about being covered thoughtfully and critically, they should come together and fund a publication where writers can be suitably paid for the time that it takes to really dig in.”While closer interaction between journalists and researchers would be a step in the right direction, Genevieve Bell, a professor of engineering and computer science at the Australian National University, says that stamping out hype in AI journalism is not possible. Bell explains that this is because articles about electronic brains or pernicious Facebook bots are less about technology and more about our cultural hopes and anxieties.“We’ve told stories about inanimate things coming to life for thousands of years, and these narratives influence how we interpret what is going on now,” Bell says. “Experts can be really quick to dismiss how their research makes people feel, but these utopian hopes and dystopian fears have to be part of the conversations. Hype is ultimately a cultural expression that has its own important place in the discourse.”Ultimately, Lipton agrees that there is a place for speculative writing about AI and he acknowledges how imagination and emotion can motivate inquiry in the field. “But I also think that boundary between wild speculation and real research is a little too flimsy right now,” he says. “As history shows us, this is a boundary that needs to be monitored so we can distinguish between what’s important in the here and now and what’s just fantasy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e219aa55cead635b421ad68891ed188bf0574469/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9329e1c23edccc8a07fa041afba396b2","title":"carles puigdemont deeds not words catalan independence belgium","story":"Ex-president vows to continue campaign from Belgium after international warrant droppedCarles Puigdemont has said he will continue to campaign for a sovereign Catalan republic from his self-imposed exile in Belgium, after a Spanish court dropped an international arrest warrant under which he was detained by police in Germany in March.The former Catalan president, who fled to Brussels last October after being sacked by the Spanish government for holding an illegal referendum and subsequently making a unilateral declaration of independence, said he would resume his efforts when he returned to Belgium this weekend.Although he is still subject to a Spanish arrest warrant on charges of rebellion and misuse of public funds, the former president said he did not intend to remain abroad indefinitely.“I don’t know if it’ll be 20 years before I set foot on Spanish soil again, but what I do know is that I won’t wait 20 years to return to Catalan soil,” he said at a press conference in Berlin on Wednesday.Asked about Spain’s new Socialist government, which has offered to hold talks to try to resolve the Catalan crisis, Puigdemont said he had seen “a change on style, climate and language”. But he said it was time for “deeds, not gestures” on the independence issue.Puigdemont continues to insist he has a mandate for seeking independence. “The decision of the Catalan people to become an independent republic is a fact,” he said.The ousted leader said the Spanish constitution could yet provide a way out of the impasse if the Madrid government was prepared to consider a mutually agreed independence referendum. Divisions in the independence movement have opened up since Puigdemont fled Spain and his vice-president, Oriol Junqueras, was taken into custody, where he remains.On Sunday Puigdemont’s centre-right Catalan Democratic party (PDeCat) elected his preferred candidate, David Bonvehí, as its new leader and voted for the creation of a Catalan republic “as soon as possible”. PDeCat’s more moderate former leader, Marta Pascal, had stepped down the day before, saying she did not have Puigdemont’s confidence.With Torra in office and Sánchez demonstrating a far more conciliatory approach to the Catalan question than his conservative predecessor Mariano Rajoy, some believe that Puigdemont is fighting to maintain his status.Puigdemont’s comments received short shrift from the leader of the Catalan branch of the Citizens party, Inés Arrimadas, who said he had always had a problem with “dates and reality”.She told the Spanish news agency Efe: “Puigdemont hasn’t stopped lying since he became president.

But beyond the absurdity, Goffe warned the rule can result in women being denied public services.“Denial of public services on account of dress must contravene the charter of rights of our constitution,” said local human rights activist Carol Narcisse.Some of Jamaica’s churches support the practice, claiming a requirement for modesty.But others are scathing in their response to such arbitrary rules. Shawn Gregory was recently turned away from visiting her ailing father in hospital because she was wearing a sleeveless top."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbdfc1d076a720e494d3f12c2b10c29e4ba48e56/488_64_2422_1453/master/2422.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3337609c2a9f9f7f1fc97557e32064fc","title":"no deal brexit unlikely ireland deputy pm coveney","story":"After talks with ministers in London, Simon Coveney says UK needs to show flexibility Too many people are “talking up inappropriately” the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit, Ireland’s deputy prime minister has said after talks with ministers in London, as Theresa May said people should not be worried by ongoing planning for such an event.Simon Coveney, who is foreign minister as well as being Leo Varadkar’s number two, said people needed to drop the “tough stance” of almost welcoming no deal, saying it was now up to the UK to show flexibility in its talks.The possibility of the UK crashing out of the EU has been talked up by some hard Brexiters in recent days, while on Tuesday the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, admitted that the government would have to ensure that there were adequate food supplies for the UK if it happened.May said that rather than being alarmed, people should be comforted by the fact ministers were making preparations for this, while still expecting as good a deal as possible.“This is a government that’s saying, you know what, we’re going to be responsible about this, we’re going to be sensible about this, but while we’re doing that we’re going to work for a really good deal that’s in the interests of people living here in the UK,” she told Five News.Coveney was speaking after talks with May’s deputy, David Lidington, and the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, as part of the British-Irish intergovernmental conference, the first such meeting in 11 years.The arrangement was set up as part of the Good Friday agreement, meaning Wednesday’s talks were focused mainly on ways to kickstart Northern Ireland’s power-sharing government and executive, which has been frozen for 19 months.After the discussions, Lidington said the UK did not want a no-deal departure, but was busy planning in case it happened.“You have to put vim and vigour into it because you want to make sure that you have thought through all potential problems and you have got a contingency plan, which in that situation would work and deliver the best outcome in those circumstances,” he said. But asked about the chances of this happening, Coveney played it down: “I think a lot of people are talking up inappropriately the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. I don’t believe it’s likely. I don’t believe anybody wants it. I don’t believe there’s a majority, certainly in the parliament that I come from or in the parliament in London, that would support that. “And so I think we need to be focusing on the intensification of the negotiations, to try and find solutions on a way forward, as opposed to the sort of tough stance that some people feel the need to take in relation to saying, ‘Well, do your worst, we can deal with a no-deal Brexit situation.’ That isn’t going to solve the problem.”The Chequers plan and white paper formed “the basis of a new intensification of negotiations on what’s possible”, Coveney said, warning that talks needed to accelerate over the summer for a deal to be ready by October’s EU summit.This would involve some UK compromises, he added: “The European Union has always said that if Britain were to soften its red lines on some of the issues in terms of these negotiations then it would show flexibility in return. And we need to test that now.”He also warned against May’s negotiating position being reshaped by amendments proposed by hard Brexiters such as Jacob Rees-Mogg, as with four changes to the customs bill that the PM accepted last week.“You can’t approach this by passing amendments in your parliament and then say, ‘Well, sorry, we can’t move now because we’ve passed an amendment,’ Coveney said. “The EU could play that game too, and could be passing legislation that would set the parameters for a negotiation.”Describing the talks with Lidington and Bradley as frank and positive, Coveney – who was accompanied by the Irish justice minister, Charles Flanagan – said re-establishing devolved government in Northern Ireland was vital.“We cannot allow Northern Ireland to drift and expect that there aren’t going to be really difficult issues,” he said. Unionists had “nothing to fear” from the process, he added: “This is an agreed structure that both governments have signed up to as part of the Good Friday agreement.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3576222.1532531385!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland completely off course to meet emissions goals","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLaura Burke, director general of the Environmental Protection Agency and a member of the  Climate Change Advisory Council athe publication of the council’s annual review for 2018 on Wednesday. Photograph: Nick BradshawIreland cannot meet its 2020 greenhouse emissions targets and is now “completely off course” to achieve other decarbonisation goals, the Climate Change Advisory Council has said. At the launch of its annual review on Wednesday, chairman Professor John FitzGerald said there was a severe deficit in the policy required to reverse Ireland’s record, frustrated by the lack of a clear Government majority. “The recession was the only policy which worked so far in making a really big change,” he said, noting 2016 emissions increases of 2 million tonnes (3.6 per cent) that returned the country to output levels last seen in 2009.In order to achieve the objective of decarbonising the economy by 2050, Ireland needs to shed 1 million tonnes of carbon per year, more than a complete reversal of current patterns. Ireland, alongside other EU countries, has committed to targets aimed at severely curtailing greenhouse gas emissions but has consistently lagged behind. Due to the lack of reductions, emissions will have reduced by less than 1 per cent come 2020, against commitments of 20 per cent. The council’s role is to monitor the country’s progress and to offer independent advice to Government on shaping policy.“The problem is there isn’t a policy framework. It is not our job to make policy,” said Professor FitzGerald. He said his concern around the need to increase carbon taxes to drive alternative energy approaches required cross-party consensus in a Dáil that lacked an overall majority. The council has called for an increase in carbon tax to €30 per tonne in the next budget and to €80 by 2030. “The Government may well accept this recommendation but it won’t happen unless the Oireachtas supports it it needs all party support,” Professor FitzGerald said. The 2018 annual review, underlining a reversal in progress in the strongest possible language, comes one month after Taoiseach Leo Varadkar reiterated his intention that Ireland be a leader on climate change. Fianna Fail described the findings as a “damning indictment of the failure of this Government to address climate change”. Environmental groups too weighed in. The Stop Climate Chaos coalition, representing 33 members, said the report’s findings were “disappointing but not surprising”. “The continued support for peat burning, renewed vigour for offshore oil and gas exploration, and long delays in support for solar power and community participation in renewable energy generation point to an alarming policy incoherence and a knowing indecision on the part of Government,” it said. The Council believes a renewed approach to carbon pricing could encourage technology changes and raise revenue to subsidise the impact of those changes on society. It welcomed the Government’s commitment to stop burning coal at Moneypoint power station by 2025 but said plans to continue burning peat with biomass to 2030 would be harmful. And while welcoming approaches set out in the National Development Plan and National Planning Framework, it said “much more” was required. Professor FitzGerald said there needed to be incentives for domestic improvements. “We need households to invest many billions by 2050,” he said. “There are 2 million houses in the country, probably three quarters of them need to spend a huge amount of money - €30,000, maybe €50,000.”Ireland’s emissions record in figures: 2 million tonnes - the current rate of annual increase in Ireland’s greenhouse emissions 1 million tonnes - the rate of annual decrease required to meet targets0.7 million tonnes - the rate of increase in the energy producing sector0.5 million tonnes - the rate found in both agriculture and transport €20 - the current rate of carbon tax in Ireland€30 - the level considered necessary by the Climate Change Advisory Council €80 - the level considered necessary by 2030"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Discovery has major implications for the chances of life surviving on the planetThis is believed to be first time a person has been prosecuted for this offence under 2006 legislationHigh Court will now have to decide if alleged drug dealer can get fair trial in PolandCoroner urges parents to check ingredients during inquest into death of Maleek Lawal (10)Victim of CervicalCheck scandal says State contributed \u0026euro25,000 to her \u0026euro2.5m settlementFr Donnchadh \u0026Oacute Cuinn argued, as a native Irish speaker, that his language rights were breachedUnion claims mangement refused to give \u0026euro1.5m for process to beginCounsel for Ruth Morrissey (37) to give evidence that two tests were \u0026lsquonegligently reported\u0026rsquoDavid Johnson Stangaciu lacerated chest when he fell onto partly open manholeAcademics claimed they were less favourably treated on grounds of gender and or family statusT\u0026aacutenaiste dismisses idea of no-deal outcome as Eurosceptic \u0026lsquobravado\u0026rsquoWildfires sweeping through the Greek resort town of Mati, east of Athens, kill at least 80Conference aimed at restoring powersharing in Stormont after its collapse in January 2017Jim Daly says using online applications to tackle the crisis was a key focus of plansChecks by uniformed officers will be necessary once the UK leaves the EUFianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says how Taoiseach operates \u0027all about optics, all about spinning\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"aerial footage shows burnt out dunes at curacloe strand","story":"  July 22, 2018Swimming race and surf lessons cancelled as emergency services urge people to stay away from Wexford beach   July 23, 2018Investigations are continuing into large blaze that ripped through 13 acres at Curracloe "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3576016.1532515188!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coveney says ireland would back brexit extension talks request","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney said the Government would back any request by the UK to extend the deadline for Article 50 negotiations Photograph: Tom HonanThe Government would back any request from the UK for an extension to the Article 50 process to give more time to negotiate withdrawal from the EU, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.The Tánaiste rejected Eurosceptic talk of a no-deal Brexit as “bravado” and said he believed there was still time to reach agreement by October.But he called for an “intensification” of talks at official level over the summer to resolve outstanding differences.Elements of the UK negotiating position laid out in UK prime minister Theresa May’s Brexit white paper would be difficult for Brussels to accommodate, he warned, though he added that the document had made negotiations “easier” by backing away from earlier red lines.He dismissed suggestions that amendments to Brexit legislation forced on Ms May by Eurosceptic backbenchers would prevent agreement on a “backstop” arrangement for the Northern Irish border.Mr Coveney was speaking as talks continued in Brussels, with a meeting between EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab scheduled for Thursday.Ms May confirmed on Tuesday that she had taken personal charge of the negotiations, with Mr Raab “deputising” for her in Brussels.Tory Eurosceptics have voiced concerns that Mr Raab’s department has been sidelined by Number 10 and Ms May’s Europe adviser Olly Robbins, amid increasing speculation that isions within the Conservative camp may result in a no-deal Brexit.Mr Coveney confirmed that the Government was making contingency plans to cope with Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal.But he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “The truth is I don’t believe that Britain can afford a no-deal Brexit, I don’t believe Ireland or the EU want that either.“The negative implications of a no-deal Brexit are very significant for Ireland and the UK. We all have an obligation to make sure that doesn’t happen. I think it’s very unlikely to happen.”Asked whether the Government would back an extension of the Article 50 process, Mr Coveney said: “Absolutely, if Britain asks for more time and if that is necessary to get to a sensible agreement, we would support that, of course we would.“But I think, even though the timetable is tight, it is possible to achieve an outcome that is good for Britain and good for the EU within the timelines that are currently there. But it also requires an intensification of the negotiations on Brexit.”Mr Coveney said that the UK had been “negotiating with itself” in the six months before the publication of the white paper.“We now have clarity in terms of what the British government ask is,” he said. “I think there are elements of that that would be difficult to negotiate... but I think it is easier to achieve now.”Potential stumbling blocks in Ms May’s plan include the separation of regimes for goods and services and the creation of a “complex” new customs arrangement under which different tariffs are charged for imports destined for the UK or EU, he said.But he rejected the idea that the amendment passed by the Commons barring a customs border in the Irish Sea would make it impossible to agree the EU’s backstop plan for Northern Ireland.“You can’t have a negotiation on the basis of passing laws in your parliament or introducing amendments in your parliament and then saying, ‘Sorry, we have no flexibility now’,” he said.“The European Union could do the same and we would get nowhere.”Mr Coveney’s comments came as more details emerged of planning for a no-deal Brexit.Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs he had asked officials to “work up options for stockpiling” by the pharmaceutical industry, while Mr Raab said the Government would also take steps to ensure an “adequate food supply”.Sarah Wollaston, chairwoman of the Commons Health Select Committee, called for more clarity about the Government’s plans.The pro-EU Tory told BBC’s Newsnight: “It’s not just about stockpiling here, there are some products that can’t be stockpiled.“Around 700,000 diagnostic tests every year in the NHS require medical radioisotopes but these have very short shelf-lives, they can’t be stockpiled and they aren’t manufactured here.”Two former Northern Ireland secretaries, Owen Paterson and Theresa Villiers, wrote in the Daily  that technological solutions can be made to work to keep the Irish border soft, “if only they are not delayed by political squabbles”.Meanwhile, efforts to repair the European Union’s relationship with the White House will see Jean-Claude Juncker meet Donald Trump in Washington for talks on the trade dispute between the US and its allies.Ahead of the meeting, the US president tweeted to suggest abolishing tariffs between the US and EU only hours after another tweet in which he declared “tariffs are the greatest!”.He wrote: “The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade. I have an idea for them.“Both the US and the EU drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade!

Photograph: iStock A huge 20km (12 mile) wide lake of liquid water lies beneath the southern ice cap of Mars, scientists have learned.Dissolved salts are thought to keep the water fluid, despite having a temperature below freezing point.The discovery, which has major implications for the chances of life surviving on the Red Planet, was made by an orbiting European probe using ground-penetrating radar.It is the first time a large stable body of liquid water has been confirmed to exist on Mars.The lake, similar to those beneath the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets on Earth, lies about 1.5km (0.9 miles) below the surface of a region called Planum Australe, close to the Martian south pole, and stretches out for 20 km.With surface temperatures as low as minus 68 degrees, it would not exist as a liquid under normal conditions.But dissolved salts of magnesium, calcium, and sodium — known to be present in Martian rocks — are thought to maintain the briny miniature sea by reducing the melting point of water to minus 74 degrees.An Italian team of scientists detected the lake while carrying out a radar survey using the Mars Express spacecraft.Between 2012 and December 2015 the Planum Australe region was mapped by the Mars Advance Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (Marsis) instrument carried on the orbiter.Radio waves beamed down to the surface by Marsis penetrated through the ice and bounced back to the spacecraft.Among the 29 radar samplings, the scientists spotted a series of unusually strong reflections bearing a distinct electrical hallmark. They revealed the presence of liquid water.Prof Roberto Orosei, from the University of Bologna, wrote in the journal Science: “Anomalously bright subsurface reflections are evident within a well-defined 20-kilometre-wide zone.. which is surrounded by much less reflective areas.“Quantitative analysis of the radar signals shows that this bright feature has high relative dielectric permittivity (electrical polarisation) matching that of water-bearing materials.“We interpret this feature as a stable body of liquid water on Mars.”The lake may exist as a layer of clear water, or possibly be mixed with soil to form a sludge.Either way, the discovery greatly increases the chances of extraterrestrial life existing on Mars.Liquid water is an essential requirement of life as we know it.Billions of years ago, Mars is thought to have had oceans and rivers, much like Earth. Primitive life may have evolved on the planet then, only to be snuffed out when the world lost most of its atmosphere and became an arid frozen desert.If large bodies of liquid water lie beneath Martian polar ice, they could theoretically harbour living microbes to this day.The high levels of salt in the water might make the environment tough but not impossible for life.On Earth, one group of organisms known as “halophiles” thrive in highly salty conditions such as those found in the Dead Sea and Utah’s Great Salt Lake.Speaking in a recorded interview released by Science, Prof Orosei revealed that his team spent years checking their results before being confident enough to announce the discovery.“We found that any other explanation for these very strong echoes was not really tenable in light of the evidence that we had available,” he said. “We had to conclude that there is water on Mars today.”The radar data showed that the lake contained a large amount of salt, Prof Orosei added.“This is certainly not a very pleasant environment for life,” he said.But he pointed out that similar salty subglacial lakes in Antarctica had been found to support life.“There are single-celled organisms that survive in such an environment with a metabolism that makes use of the salt,” said the professor.Marsis was not able to measure the depth of lake, but the scientists estimate that it must be at least one metre thick.–PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3575294.1532450517!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"etiquette is all in punjab club as political intrigues reach crescendo","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSupporters of Imran Khan, head of the Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf  party, listen to his speech at an election rally in Karachi, Pakistan, in recent days. Pakistan is to hold general and provincial elections on  July 25th. Photograph: Shahzaib AkberEPATwo cats are fighting under a peepal tree in the gardens of the Punjab Club, a screeching whirl of black and ginger momentarily disturbing the genteel tranquillity of Pakistan’s most exclusive private members’ club.This is where the cream of the country’s elite exchange high-society gossip over single malt and cigars in the antiquated confines of the Oak Room, with its displays of pistols and crossed swords, their every whim attended to by waiters in turbans. Steeped in memories of the Raj, they seek refuge from the present-day political turmoil.“So good to see you.”“Where have you been?”“It’s been so long!”Voices echoing in the marbled lobby, they greet each other in English before launching into Urdu, these politicians, judges, lawyers and business people. Beneath the crystal chandeliers, they hold muted discussions on an allegedly dirty election blighted by rumours of military backing for cricketing legend Imran Khan. It’s a contest that could upend the current order, break the duopoly of the country’s two political dynasties: the Bhuttos and the Sharifs.The stakes are high, but voices are never raised. Etiquette is everything. Decorum rules.At lunch, I sit next to two men representing different strands of the elite, the air fragrant with tuberose, vaguely wondering if I’ve selected the right fork for the rondelles of pink meat studded with olives.Farid, a businessman from one of the country’s most prestigious families, signed me in. His loyalties are with Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party. Like Khan, he attended nearby Aitchison College, the Eton of Pakistan. The old boys’ network is alive and well, even if the mercurial politician has turned his back on his debonair past, making new chums like Amir Liaquat Hussain, a religious hardliner with a penchant for accusing liberals of blasphemy.But the old chums don’t forget. Khan’s power push might not be quite cricket, but they cling to the belief he will make good on his promises of creating, well ... a country that works.“The true Imran will emerge,” says Farid.Sitting next to us is Ashtar, a gimlet-eyed former attorney general, said to have the ear of ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif. Sharif would have been standing against Khan if he hadn’t been jailed for corruption. Ashtar is now providing legal counsel to members of Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, which is being targeted in an industrial-scale corruption crackdown on the old guard. He terms it a “judicial coup”.“The caretakers have become undertakers for Nawaz and the cradle rockers for Imran,” he declares. It’s not idle talk. Ashtar fought for an independent judiciary during the military dictatorship of Pervez Musharraf, landing in jail, where he suffered a heart attack.We all look out the floor-to-ceiling windows, beyond the phoenix palms to the shimmering waters of the club’s pool. “The fish is good,” says Farid, looking slightly queasy.With Farid’s help, I book a night in one of the sedately furnished rooms, which gives me access to the main attraction. After a refreshing swim, I chat to one of the club’s female members, who works as a psychologist. It’s so hard to work out what’s going on in this country where “tables can be turned at any moment”. But, by the sound of things, it’s harder still to understand Imran Khan.The psychologist supported Khan in the last election. No matter what, Khan is still “one of us”, she says. But his erratic taste in women disturbs her. British heiress Jemima Goldsmith, mother of Khan’s two sons, is considered his true love. Then came Reham Khan, a former BBC weather presenter, who has just dished the dirt on their 10-month marriage in a pre-election book, alleging drug-abuse and philandering. And now he’s with Bushra Maneka, a spiritual healer, who appeared in recent wedding photos with her entire face covered by a red veil.What is Khan playing at? The Lahore elite know him. And they know Bushra is not his type of woman. He’s searching for something he can only find within, says the psychologist.We could talk Imran all day long, but there’s something I need to know, something that goes deeper than the current political intrigues. In the Teak Room, over tankards of sharp Murree beer, I quiz Farid and Ashtar on Pakistan’s post-colonial identity. How did the Pakistani elite come to adopt an institution symbolic of Empire’s worst excesses, the sort of place that would have once had a sign saying “No dogs or Indians” at the entrance?The pair immediately warm to the subject. Ashtar says that top-ranking local administrators, the so-called “brown sahibs”, needed to retain power and order in the bloody chaos of partition. He understands that the notion might be perplexing. After all, the Brits dressed the waiters in those turbans to humiliate the Mughal nawabs. “It was out of spite,” he says. “If I had my way, I’d make them wear bow ties.”Why doesn’t he present a motion to the board?“I might just do that,” he says, a mischievous smile playing on his lips.In the 71 years of Pakistan’s often violent history, the Punjab Club has served a purpose, proving a refuge where views can be freely expressed. “Respect for other peoples’ opinions is like a balm,” says Ashtar.Only the cats serve as a brief reminder of the wild world outside the high walls.

That concept, what it is, is about making sure that we will be able to continue to do the things that are necessary once we have left the European Union, if we leave without a deal.”Mrs May’s comments came as a new poll suggests trust in her ability to handle Brexit is falling.A ICM poll found she had an eight-point lead over Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn over who could be trusted to negotiate a good Brexit deal, down from 16 points in January and 34 points before the 2017 general election.Chancellor Philip Hammond said it is “sensible and responsible” that the Government is working with industry to stockpile certain vital supplies for the event of a no-deal.Speaking during a visit to the Bombardier aircraft factory in Belfast on Wednesday, he said: “That’s a sensible and responsible thing for a Government to do and large businesses who are importing or exporting large volumes of products or produce will be making contingency plans, and we would encourage them to do so and work closely with them as they are putting those plans together.”Mr Hammond also ruled out extending the Article 50 process to give more time to negotiate withdrawal from the EU, after the Irish Government said it would back such a move.He said Parliament had legislated for the current exit date in March after suggestions an extension could help avoid the risk of a no-deal Brexit taking place.It came as talks continued in Brussels, with a meeting between EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and Mr Raab scheduled for Thursday.Ms May confirmed on Tuesday that she had taken personal charge of the negotiations, with Mr Raab “deputising” for her in Brussels.Tory Eurosceptics have voiced concerns that Mr Raab’s department has been sidelined by Number 10 and Ms May’s Europe adviser Olly Robbins, amid increasing speculation that isions within the Conservative camp may result in no deal.Mr Coveney confirmed Dublin is making contingency plans to cope with Britain crashing out of the EU without a deal, but he told BBC Radio 4’s Today that Dublin would “absolutely” back an extension if Ms May’s Government asked for it.Speaking outside Parliament in London after the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, the Tánaiste said a no-deal Brexit is not in British or Irish best interests, but he remains confident a deal will be reached.He said: “We need to be focusing on the intensification of negotiations to try and find the solutions on a way forward as opposed to the sort of tough stance that some people feel the need to take in relation to saying ‘well do your worst, we can deal with a (no-deal) situation’. That isn’t going to solve this problem.” – Press Association"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Seagram heiress arrested as part of case against Nxivm \u0026#39sex cult\u0026#39Theresa May discusses stockpiling and what the non-negotiable issues of Brexit areGerman employment minister bucks Europe trend and calls for more immigrationUK heatwave: Britain soars towards hottest day ever as Met Office says all-time record of 38.5C could be brokenUK\u0026#39s largest gold nugget found by man who lay in Scottish river for hoursGroundbreaking new HIV drug linked to higher risk of birth defectsGreece wildfires: Desperate families search for missing as death toll hits 80Grandmother banned from phoning 999 or 111 ended up taking overdose  to get to hospital Wildfires are up more than a third in Europe - with heatwave-hit north seeing huge increasesComment: My name\u0026#39s Catherine, not Katherine - and yes, it mattersThe \u0026#39five hours of terror\u0026#39 escaping Greece firesPolice afraid to tackle criminals because of social media backlash, says officer on trialNew blood pressure targets could cut dementia risk New Zealand grants paid leave to domestic violence victimsNestlé suffers defeat in decade-long KitKat court battlePhoto-taking tourist shoved out of the way by Queen\u0026#39s GuardsmanNew \u0026#39manual\u0026#39 advises doctors how to treat child blast victims in conflicts which ignore the rules of warMacron jokes \u0026#39he\u0026#39s not my lover\u0026#39 as he takes full responsibility for bodyguard scandalComment: The MOT test is obsolete and makes our roads no safer - it\u0026#39s time to scrap itMan with no penis admits sexually assaulting two women who thought they were having sex with himUK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century on FridayWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Upon finding the nugget the man - in his 40s - ran from the water clutching his gold shouting “bingo”.The nugget was discovered in a river in Scotland but its name is being kept under wraps in a bid to avoid a gold rush.Breaking his silence, the lucky hunter said he came across it by “sniping”, a method where hunters don a dry suit and snorkel before lying face down in a river.A crack in the bedrock of the river showed a fine line of gold and led to a large pocket containing the huge chunkThe man, who has been hunting for gold as a hobby for 20 years, said: “I was following a crack in the bedrock and found around 2g in fine gold.“This then led to a pocket, where I uncovered the nugget. I called over my friend to have a look and we both assumed it to be around 5-7g in weight.“It wasn\u0027t until I removed it that we realised just how big it was.” He added: “I took off my glove and picked it up, jumped out of the water and screamed, \u0027Bingo!\u0027 to my friend.“We were both stunned and couldn\u0027t believe it. I\u0027ve never seen anything like it in my lifetime.”The man is unsure what to do with his nugget and is keeping it in a safety deposit box in the meantime - but there is a danger the Crown Estate could claim the proceeds if it is sold.Under law, gold and silver are classed as Mines Royal, meaning that in most cases they belong to the crown. The technique used to find it is called sniping, where the treasure hunter lies face down in the water with a snorkel and gogglesHunters therefore need permission from The Crown Estate to take away any gold that is found, regardless of the method used to find it. It is not clear whether permission has been granted. Leon Kirk, from Gold Panning Supplies UK, and friend of the lucky hunter, said that while they were concerned that giving away the location of the river could cause a huge gold rush, his friend was also keen to keep his find a secret to allow him to fully search the river. “It’s a bit of a secret society gold panning when you find a good river,” he said. “I know this guy has spent the last two years looking through the rest of the river where he found this huge nugget.“He’s found lots of other pieces of gold since so that’s probably why he’s kept it quiet - you wouldn’t want to give something like that away. “I think we’re both of the view as well that telling people where it was could ruin the river - but I don’t even know where he found it.”Leon Kirk said the find had been kept quiet to allow the hunter to scour the rest of the riverAlthough he does not know exactly where the gold was found, Mr Kirk recommended that people scour Wanlockhead in Dumfries, Galloway where gold nuggets have been discovered before. In 2015 a £10,000 nugget, which weighed approximately 18 grams, was found near Wanlockhead. Mr Kirk added: “This is a very exciting and unprecedented find. But the nugget\u0027s rarity means it is very hard to put a price on it.“I would say it is worth at least £50,000 but, as it\u0027s rarer than a Aston Martin or a Faberge egg, a billionaire could easily come along and pay a lot more for it.“Historically, it is off the Richter scale.”The Douglas Nugget is believed to share a similar diameter to that of a 1.6ins golf ball.Dr Neil Clark, author of Scottish Gold: Fruit Of The Nation, believes the shape of the Douglas Nugget could mean there is more gold just waiting to be found close to the mystery location.He said: “The size of the nugget suggests that it probably did not travel far.” But added: “The fact that we have waited over 500 years for this nugget suggests it may be difficult to find another comparable one in the near future.”Dumfries and GallowayPlease review our commenting policyGerman employment minister bucks Europe trend and calls for more immigrationUK heatwave: Britain soars towards hottest day ever as Met Office says all-time record of 38.5C could be brokenGroundbreaking new HIV drug linked to higher risk of birth defectsGreece wildfires: Desperate families search for missing as death toll hits 80Grandmother banned from phoning 999 or 111 ended up taking overdose  to get to hospital Wildfires are up more than a third in Europe - with heatwave-hit north seeing huge increasesComment: My name\u0026#39s Catherine, not Katherine - and yes, it mattersThe \u0026#39five hours of terror\u0026#39 escaping Greece firesPolice afraid to tackle criminals because of social media backlash, says officer on trialNew blood pressure targets could cut dementia risk New Zealand grants paid leave to domestic violence victimsNestlé suffers defeat in decade-long KitKat court battlePhoto-taking tourist shoved out of the way by Queen\u0026#39s GuardsmanNew \u0026#39manual\u0026#39 advises doctors how to treat child blast victims in conflicts which ignore the rules of warMacron jokes \u0026#39he\u0026#39s not my lover\u0026#39 as he takes full responsibility for bodyguard scandalComment: The MOT test is obsolete and makes our roads no safer - it\u0026#39s time to scrap itMan with no penis admits sexually assaulting two women who thought they were having sex with himUK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century on FridayWoman must stay in unhappy marriage, judges rule, as they urge Parliament to change orce law Deposed Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont says he will return to BelgiumIsil suicide bombers kill more than 180 in southern Syria in one of deadliest days of warWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/15/textile-waste-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/15/textile-waste-1.jpg","title":"burberry burns stock designer clothing fashion industry environment","story":"Created with Sketch.Upmarket British label has destroyed £105m of unwanted stock in past five yearsClick to followThe Independent OnlineBurberry burns £28.6m of clothes and cosmetics \u0027to protect its brand\u0027Burberry\u0026nbspdestroyed £28.6m of clothing and cosmetics last year as part of efforts to\u0026nbspprotect its upmarket brand and guard against counterfeiting.The luxury British label incinerated the equivalent of\u0026nbsp81,000 of its signature plaid scarves, according to its latest annual accounts, in a practice said to be rife among fashion houses.Industry insiders\u0026nbspsay high-end brands burn\u0026nbspunwanted stock to prevent their clothes being sold at knockdown prices and worn by the\u0026nbsp“wrong people”.But the fashion houses\u0026nbspsay surplus goods are incinerated to prevent them falling into the hands of counterfeiters.Burberry destroyed more than £90m of products over the last five years, and the amount burnt annually has increased dramatically. In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly. There is no way of disposing of this amount of clothing in a way that is not environmentally invasive.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Log inFigures from Nielsen released this week pointed to the strongest UK grocery sales in five years thanks to the heatwave.Separate data from the Kantar Worldpanel also showed supermarket sales spiking over the 12 weeks to the 15 July, with credit given to “the prolonged hot weather”.Yet official data from the Office for National Statistics showed an unexpected fall in retail sales volumes in June, with the agency saying that “consumers stayed away from stores and instead enjoyed the World Cup and the heatwave”.So is the heatwave likely to boost retail sales, or not?And will it have any positive effect on the wider economy?For the obvious reasons.People buy things they need to cope with or enjoy the hot weather. Kantar says that Britons stocked up on items such as barbecue firelighters, alcohol and sun cream.Domestic tourism can\u0026nbspalso get a\u0026nbspboost.There’s also the feel good factor. If people are happier because of the hot weather the theory is that consumer confidence will be higher and they will spend more in the shops.But economists stress that the economic impact can be ambiguous.“It is a bit of a double edged sword,” says Howard Archer of the EY Item Club.“Pubs are taking spend share off restaurants and food spend is also a rotation of spending patterns rather than volume increase.”Mr French is also sceptical of the consumer confidence boost channel.\u0026nbspOther economists point out that hot temperatures can adversely affect workers’ productivity levels.According to the ONS, roughly £400bn\u0026nbspwas spent on retail sales, including fuel, in 2017.Total GDP last year was around £2 trillion, meaning retail sales account for roughly a fifth of the economy.So a decent performance from retail sales in a quarter can deliver a significant boost to overall growth. Indeed, despite the slippage in June, the ONS estimates that over the second quarter retail sales were still up 2.1 per cent.That alone should deliver 0.4 percentage points to second quarter GDP growth.That’s very useful after growth slumped to just 0.2 per cent in the first quarter.The UK had a very hot summer in 2003. And GDP grew rapidly in the second half of the year.However there was a marked growth slowdown in 2004, which signals that any household consumption boost was merely expenditure brought forward rather than being additional.The last comparable UK heatwave to the current one was in the summer of 1976.GDP did grow extremely quickly in the second half of that year, rising by 1.2 per cent in the third quarter and 2.1 per cent in the final quarter.You can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/26/16/mosque-1.jpg","title":"seyran ates islam mosque religon germany","story":"Created with Sketch.Seyran Ates, a Turkish-born German lawyer and women\u0027s rights activist, could not find a mosque where she felt at home.

They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

There had been some signs of liquid water currently on Mars, including disputed evidence of water activity on Martian slopes, but not stable bodies of water.The discovery was found by scientists using the\u0026nbspMars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (Marsis) instrument on the Mars Express spacecraft. That instruments sends out radar pulses that penetrate the surface and ice caps on Mars, and measures the radio waves when they come back to the spacecraft.Scientists led by\u0026nbspRoberto Orosei\u0026nbspexamined that data between\u0026nbspMay 2012 and December 2015 and found that there was a very sharp change in the radar signals, when looking at the area, which was found 1.5km beneath the surface.The researchers spent two years ensuring that the data wasn’t the result of some other effect – eventually ruling out every possible explanation apart from liquid water of some kind.“It’s tempting to think that this is the first candidate place where life could persist\u0026nbspon Mars,” said Orosei.The data is similar to that seen when radars look at\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsplakes of liquid water found beneath the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets on Earth. Scientists have suggested that microbial life could live in those extreme conditions – as it might on Mars.“This kind of environment is not exactly your ideal vacation, or a place where fish would swim,” Orosei added. “But there are terrestrial organisms that can survive and thrive, in fact, in similar environments. There are microorganisms on Earth that are capable of surviving even in ice.”Scott Hubbard, a professor of astronautics at Stanford University who served as Nasa’s first Mars program director in 2000, called it “tremendously exciting”.\u0026nbsp“Our mantra back then was ‘follow the water’.\u0026nbspThat was the one phrase that captured everything,” Hubbard said. “So this discovery, if it stands, is just thrilling because it’s the culmination of that philosophy.”\u0026nbspIt is even colder on Mars than it is in the Antarctic and Greenland, making the discovery of liquid water even more surprising.The water itself is likely to be a briny sludge. The\u0026nbspsalt that makes that brine is also probably the reason there is liquid water at all, since it helps melt the otherwise icy water in the same way grit is used to remove snow from streets.“This is a stunning result that suggests water on Mars is not a temporary trickle like previous discoveries but a persistent body of water that provides the conditions for life for extended periods of time,” said\u0026nbspAlan Duffy, an astronomer from Swinburne University and the lead scientist of Australia’s Science Channel.There is nothing particularly special about the area where the water was found – it is simply the region on Mars where the radar that made the detection is most sensitive. That means that there could be similar deposits under the ground all the way across Mars.It remains to be seen if more subsurface reservoirs of water will be found or whether the newly discovered one is some sort of quirk, Orosei said.If others are detected and a network of subglacial lakes exists like on Earth, he said, that could indicate liquid water has persisted for millions of years or even dating back to 3.5 billion years ago when Mars was a more hospitable planet.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But in many parts of the country, people have travelled to vote regardless of the security issues.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s live blog of the Pakistan election. You can follow all the latest updates throughout the day here.Polls were scheduled to open at 8am local time (3.30am BST)\u0026nbspacross the country, and\u0026nbspwitnesses and national media say that voting is now underway across many polling stations.Voters will decide\u0026nbsptoday between\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspformer cricket legend and playboy\u0026nbspImran Khan, and the party of ex-leader\u0026nbspNawaz Sharif, who has been\u0026nbspjailed on corruption charges that he says are politically motivated.Mr Khan\u0027s PTI\u0026nbspparty has positioned itself as an anti-corruption vehicle\u0026nbspof change - but Mr Sharif\u0027s PML-N\u0026nbsphas accused him of being the military\u0027s candidate.While PTI has held a narrow lead in polls leading up to the election, most forecasters are predicting a hung parliament that will require a coalition government.It means that independents and other smaller parties - like the PPP\u0026nbspled by the son of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto - could yet play a key role in coalition.\u0026nbspToday\u0027s vote will be the first time Pakistan has ever achieved a second democratic transition of power in a row. Throughout its history, the country has oscillated between military and civilian rule.Yet while that should be being hailed as an unprecedented landmark of stability for the nation, there are warning signs to be found in a campaign that has been one of the most dangerous and distasteful in modern history.From social media to the streets, the vicious nature of the campaign has polarised Pakistani society into supporters of Mr Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek Insaf (PTI) party, and the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N) of Mr Sharif.The chief election commissioner (CEC), retired Justice Sardar Muhammad Raza, on Tuesday assured voters that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was “trying its best to hold free, fair and unbiased elections”.In a video message released by the election body, Mr Raza urged voters to fulfil their “duty towards the nation” by casting their votes calmly and responsibly on polling day.There have been positive landmarks to be found aside from the flurry of recriminations in the campaign. For the first time in history, five trans candidates will be standing for election, and there are also a record 171 women in the running, though they make a small minority of the 12,500 candidates vying for national and provincial seats across the country.Nonetheless, there will be a huge security presence trying to maintain order on the streets on Wednesday, with approximately 800,000 law enforcement and army personnel deployed.Of more than 85,000 polling stations across the country, around 17,000 have been declared “highly sensitive” and will receive special security measures.The majority of these – more than 11,000 – were in the populous Punjab and Sindh provinces, where the election is expected to be won or lost. Rights activists have also expressed concern that soldiers will be positioned inside booths where votes are cast.For Ayesha Siddiqa, a defence analyst and author of a book about the power and financial holdings of Pakistan’s military, the outlook is worrying. She said: “Whatever way elections run, I see a lot of instability.”Today\u0027s isive race is likely to come down to Punjab, the country\u0027s most populous province, where Sharif\u0027s party has clung to its lead in recent surveys.Let\u0027s test Imran as we have been testing others for the last several decades, said first-time voter Yousaf Ali, a 22-year-old medical student who cast his ballot for Khan\u0027s party in the city of Lahore in Punjab.An anti-corruption crusader, Khan has promised an Islamic welfare state and cast his populist campaign as a battle to topple a predatory political elite hindering development in the impoverished mostly-Muslim nation of 208 million people, where the illiteracy rate hovers above 40 percent.We are pitched against mafias, Khan, 65, said in one of his last rallies in the coastal city of Karachi. These are mafias who made money in this country and siphoned it abroad, burying this nation in debt.Pakistan\u0026nbspMuslim League chief Shahbaz Sharif cast his vote in the eastern city of Lahore soon after polls opened in national elections.\u0026nbspSharif, the younger brother of disgraced ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif, took over the ruling\u0026nbspPakistan\u0026nbspMuslim League last year after his brother was found guilty of corruption. The ex-prime minister has since been sentenced to 10 years in jail, which he is serving while appealing the conviction.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAfter voting he told reporters: Do not waste your time. Get out of your homes and cast your vote. We will change the destiny of this country through the power of people. If we come into power, we will end poverty, give education to everyone, make millions of homes and build the Bhasha dam. He added: China and Saudi Arabia are keen to help us.\u0026nbspHe said he believed today people will vote in support of\u0026nbspNawaz Sharif and his daughter\u0026nbspMaryam, who was also jailed, and prove they support democracy.\u0026nbspThe younger Sharif stood in line waiting his turn to enter the polling booth. In\u0026nbspPakistan, a candidate can run for elections in multiple seats. If the candidate wins more than one seat, a by-election will be held as a person can represent only one constituency.\u0026nbspSharif marked his ballot for both the National and Punjab provincial Parliaments and is contesting elections in four National Assembly seats and in two Punjab provincial legislature seats.One dead in shooting between political rivals\u0026nbspPolice have confirmed to The Independent that a party activist has been killed in what is thought to be the first incident of deadly violence on election day.\u0026nbspWe are receiving\u0026nbspinformation from\u0026nbsplocal sources of a shootout in the northwestern city of Sawabi between staff of the PTI and secular Awami National Workers (ANP) parties.\u0026nbspPTI says that one of its activists was killed, and another four people were injured in the incident.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLocal police confirmed that tally, but\u0026nbspsay\u0026nbspthe situation is now under control and voting is back\u0026nbspunderway in Col Sher Khan village.\u0026nbspOther minor incidents have also been reported.

He said: The explosion occurred near a school where polling was taking place.

The attack was claimed by Isis militants.About 371,000 soldiers have been stationed at polling stations across the country to prevent attacks, nearly five times the number deployed at the last election in 2013.Isis has claimed responsibility for the bombing in Quetta, in a message shared by the group\u0027s Amaq news agency.Please allow a moment for the live blog to loadMr Khan\u0027s\u0026nbspPTI\u0026nbspparty has positioned itself as an anti-corruption vehicle of change - but Mr Sharif\u0027s\u0026nbspPML-N\u0026nbsphas accused him of being the military\u0027s candidate.

Throughout its history, the country has oscillated between military and civilian rule.Yet while that should be being hailed as an unprecedented landmark of stability for the nation, there have long been warning signs in a campaign that has been one of the most dangerous and distasteful in modern history.From social media to the streets, the vicious nature of the campaign polarised Pakistani society into supporters of Mr Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek Insaf (PTI) party, and the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N) of Mr Sharif.The chief election commissioner (CEC), retired Justice Sardar Muhammad Raza, on Tuesday assured voters that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was “trying its best to hold free, fair and unbiased elections”.In a video message released by the election body, Mr Raza urged voters to fulfil their “duty towards the nation” by casting their votes calmly and responsibly on polling day.\u0026nbspPolling began at 8am local time, and concluded\u0026nbspat 6pm.

Until four years ago Fatima Abu Shedeg was not only unable to swim but had never been in a pool.\u0026nbspYet despite the challenges she has faced, she spends her days dreaming of stepping onto the starting block at\u0026nbspthe Tokyo 2020 Games as Gaza’s first Olympic swimmer.\u0026nbspIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead. She saw her uncle’s legs blown off in the same airstrike that killed her father and destroyed most of their home in Beit Lahia, north Gaza.\u0026nbspLike many children in the tiny enclave, she suffered from post-traumatic stress.\u0026nbspThen Amjed Tantesh, 42, a swimming coach and one-time Olympic hopeful, encouraged her to learn to swim as a way of channelling her depression and anger.\u0026nbsp“A week after my dad passed away Amjed called my mum and offered me and my brother swimming lessons. My dad was killed by shrapnel from an airstrike which ricocheted off the wall and hit his heart. The same airstrike blew off my uncle’s leg. We were all downstairs screaming,” she said sitting by a small pool filled with murky green water in Gaza City.\u0026nbsp“It’s extremely important for me to achieve my dream, the dream of my family, of my coach, to be the first Gazan swimmer to take part in the Olympics,” she added.\u0026nbspFour years later, the fitness and football fanatic\u0026nbspspends her free time training in grubby and sometimes makeshift pools. Gaza is in the 11th year of an Israeli blockade, meaning Fatima cannot even get hold of proper swimming equipment. She is left to swim in a mismatched pair of pyjamas. If she qualifies it would be her first trip out of Gaza, which is just 25 miles long.She said swimming had helped her deal with trauma from the war and made her stronger.\u0026nbsp“I don’t want to be afraid any more. I want to be strong. I used to even be afraid of the pool, of water, and now I’m not. I’m determined to work on myself, to succeed,”\u0026nbspshe said.\u0026nbspIn June Save the Children\u0026nbspreported that a staggering 95 per cent of children in Gaza had depression, consistent with deep psychological distress. The charity said the constant threat of conflict, the fear of bombs, and the constant insecurity caused by the unstable political situation had created a psychological crisis in the country.\u0026nbspMany fear Gaza is now on the brink of another war with Israel as tensions have reached boiling point.\u0026nbspOn Friday the Israeli army said one of its soldiers had been killed by Palestinian gunmen near the border, the first Israeli military death near Gaza since the 2014 war. The army unleashed a tide of airstrikes that pummelled over 60 military targets in the enclave, in one of the most intense days of violence in four years.By the end of the day, the Gaza health ministry said that at least four Palestinians had been killed. As fires raged through the strip, a shaky truce brokered by Egypt was enforced. On Saturday, the United Nations urged both sides it was “imperative” to step back from the brink of a “devastating conflict”.At the heart of the latest eruption of hostilities is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests near the border fences that the Israeli army has met with force. More than 140 Palestinians been killed by Israeli fire since 30 March, when residents of Gaza first marched on the fences demanding right to return to ancestral lands they were forced from during the 1948 war which surrounded the creation of Israel.\u0026nbspSome of the protesters have taken to launching burning kites and balloons attached with explosives at Israel, sparking more than 750 wildfires and scorching 2,600 hectares of land.The Palestinians maintain the protests are peaceful and Israel is firing on them with live ammunition. Israel says their soldiers have been attacked and the wildfires are endangering Israeli citizens.\u0026nbspEarlier this week saw the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza and Israel since the 2014 conflict. Egypt reportedly intervened to stop war breaking out.Amid the escalating conflict, children, like Fatima, have suffered the most.\u0026nbspMr Tantesh said there were few resources or outlets for the youth to deal with trauma, though\u0026nbspswimming had\u0026nbspproven\u0026nbspa cheap alternative.\u0026nbspHe launched his swimming initiative in 1999 and said he has since taught more than\u0026nbsp5,400 children to swim. \u0026nbspBecause he initially\u0026nbsplacked access to pools and so, in the aftermath of the 2014 war, Tantesh built a makeshift sea pool\u0026nbspby using concrete blocks from bombed-out buildings to cordon off an area of the beach in north Gaza, where the water is less polluted.\u0026nbspIn 2015 alone, he taught some 465 children, with most of them receiving free swimming lessons.\u0026nbsp“All of them are war afflicted, they have lost a father, mother, relative or they have had a house destroyed,” he told The Independent.“But our new ambition is to prepare some of those children to qualify for the Olympics. Fatima is by far our best chance, she has developed the fastest and so we hope she will represent Gaza in Tokyo 2020. I have never seen such determination and persistence,” he added.Meet the girl who wants to be Gaza’s first Olympic SwimmerFatima Abu Shedeg, 13, dreams of leaping from the blocks at Tokyo 2020Fatima has survived three wars and until four years ago she was not only unable to swim but had never been in a poolIn 2014, Fatima lost her father during the last war with Israel, which raged for 51 days and left more than 2,200 Palestinians and 73 Israelis dead.

Bar one person, a young judoka from Jerusalem who qualified in London’s 2012 Games, they have all competed on a wild card scheme.The Palestinian Olympic Committee chooses its teams from Gaza, the West Bank and Palestinian communities across the world. So Fatima will face stiff competition while she makes do with scant resources.Gaza lacks an Olympic-size swimming pool and the few pools it does have struggle to stay open amid chronic energy shortages. It is also increasingly dangerous to swim in the sea.\u0026nbspGaza’s environment authority said last year that nearly two-thirds of its 25 mile coastline was seriously polluted.\u0026nbspSewage treatment plants cannot function due to the power\u0026nbspshortages. The United Nations said that more than 100 million litres of waste water are pumped into the sea off Gaza every day.With filthy beaches and not enough electricity\u0026nbspto keep pools clean, trying to train a swimming team is near impossible, according to the Olympic Committee in Gaza.\u0026nbspIn a battered office and sat in front of a battery-powered fan, Munther Masalmeh, the committee’s secretary-general, said it would be a “major achievement” for a swimmer in Gaza to reach the Olympics.“There is not a single pool in Gaza that hits international standards. With our infrastructure problems it makes it even harder. It would be a major achievement to have a female swimmer here because of the lack of resources,” he told The Independent.The Israeli blockade also restricts access to sports equipment. Mr Masalmeh claimed even iron goal posts were banned because the Israelis feared\u0026nbspthey could be used to make weapons.“Sports equipment gets stuck in the ports for year and does not reach the athletes. In addition, the Israelis have in the past banned players from leaving Gaza to participate in international tournaments,” he added.Nonetheless, Fatima hopes one day to get permission to leave Gaza and take her place at the Games.“I want to achieve my dream to be picked for the Olympics, so I can travel and compete in the 100m race,” she said, putting on her swimming pyjamas.“I don’t just want to participate, I want to get first place,\u0026nbspso those who picked me are proud.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We all have an obligation to make sure that that does not happen.He later added: \u0026ldquoThe point I was making this morning when I was asked to comment on the likelihood of a no deal Brexit was that I think a lot of people are talking up inappropriately the likelihood of a no deal Brexit.\u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot believe it is likely.

Politics is a man’s world and, to many, women still feel like token visitors.Even when Tony Blair famously had 101 “babes” in his 1997 intake of MPs, only four of his Cabinet appointments were female.Here we are, 20 years later, and yes, we have a female Prime Minister but there is still a prevailing view that the Cabinet, in particular, belongs to men.Clearly there’s something profoundly wrong with that equation.Given that this country is made up, more or less equally, of men and women, things would undoubtedly be fairer, not to mention calmer, if more women were on board.So the big question is, why aren’t there?Things are better than they were. Since the 2017 election there are 208 women in the Commons, up from 191 in 2015.But there are still not enough and you don’t have to look far for reasons why that might be.Most women are put off by the environment and the culture and wonder why on earth they would want to put themselves within a country mile of either.Take Prime Minister’s Question Time, which appears to be a bunch of overgrown public school boys booing, jeering and jostling with each other in their bid to establish who is top dog.What woman in her right mind would choose to enter that fray?Then there are the practicalities. This week, Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson was “cheated” in a crunch Brexit vote by the breaking of her pairing pact.This is an arrangement where one MP agrees not to vote to cancel out the fact that another MP on the opposite side is unable to vote — in this case Swinson was at home with her three-week-old baby.The problem was, her pairing partner reneged on the deal and voted.Then there are the hours, which can be difficult if you have a family. Any woman would need a very understanding partner and family to do the job.Also, any MP is opening themselves up to the line of fire and a lot of personal criticism — which multiplies for female MPs.Some have to deal with endless comments and speculation about their appearance, as well as threats of rape and death on a regular basis. Just this week a man was arrested over abusive Facebook posts aimed at various female MPs.If it’s true voters are biased against women, any female has to be ten times as talented, determined and tenacious to get the job in the first place.It’s no wonder women are put off entering politics.But if we want true equality then more women need to go into Westminster and the culture needs to change.That is why I support the campaign group Women To Win and will be taking part in an event called The Voice Of Women In Politics.The idea is to try to encourage more women into Parliament, outlining some of the changes that need to take place to raise the number of female candidates.Getting more women into politics is a no brainer.Women tend to work collaboratively to solve problems whereas — in my experience — men are more likely to lock horns, point fingers and try to shout the loudest. All too often men are interested in progressing to be a leader, whereas women are more focused on getting the job done.And when women DO find their voice in politics, it can be very powerful, and they often hae the balls to say things that men just wouldn’t.Look at Tory minister Anna Soubry, who this week suggested the PM should take control of her hardliner MPs and stop pandering to the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg.I know she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment, but if I was Theresa May I would be spending a good proportion of my time and energy on making real changes to politics in order, specifically, to attract many more women.It could be one of the greatest legacies she could hope for.Thomas Markle is a concerned dad who just wants to be reconnected with his daughter.Meanwhile this HALF-sister has turned a constant shade of green and wants to get involved in any way she can.Is it any wonder she wasn’t invited to the wedding?MY heroine of the week is 21-year-old Emilia Holden a waitress in Georgia, US, who was at the end of a shift when a customer casually grabbed her bottom as he walked past.Her response? She followed him, grabbed him and body slammed him to the ground, then called the police – after which he spent two nights in a police cell.What a fantastic response. Good for her.But also, who are these men that think that they can just grab a woman’s behind just because they want to?But hearing about elaborate plans by Pixie Lott which include a total of 18 bridesmaids all wearing the same dress, left me feeling a bit stressed out.Apart from anything else, it will take them all an hour to travel up the aisle.JAMES GODDARD-WATTS, the businessman whose family founded the hardware firm Screwfix, is still locked in a multi-million pound divorce battle with his ex-wife, Julia.They reached an agreement eight years ago ­– following the end of a 13-year marriage – that Mrs Goddard-Watts should get a £3.25million house and a £4million lump sum.But she complained that Mr Goddard-Watts had not revealed the full extent of his wealth at the time of the settlement and court fights began.Critics say Julia is a leech, greedy and after his money.But when you consider the worth and value of building a home, looking after children and a family while supporting a spouse, that should be worth at least half of whatever the partner who didn’t do all of that has earned in the meantime.So why shouldn’t she take him back to court?The law states that assets are divided equally.So people who hide theirs from their spouse only have themselves to blame if said spouse feels forced to take them to court to get what’s fair.ELLE Macpherson’s diet regime is enough to make me reach for the pizza delivery menu.The model is up at 5am. She has warm water, lemon and cayenne pepper.She has no booze, almost no carbs, no meat and no dairy. She is such a follower of the alkaline diet – based on the theory you can change the pH of your body through food – that she checks the acidity of her urine.I’m sure the diet is good for her – but who wants to add years to your life if those years are going to be so, well, dull?“The only chance I have of being on TV again is if I were very ugly,” he said.“I think only old, ugly women can get on TV.

Or a crap remake of Fight Club — except they DO talk about Fight Club. All the time.Theresa May has the leadership skills of a damp dishcloth, no authority and no political vision.A strong leader needs a clear mission. You may not agree with it, but you know what they stand for.“Live each day like it’s your last,” is our Prime Minister’s political strategy, except she’s not dancing in the rain.She is waiting for the sharks to circle. And soon they will come for her.Buffoon-in-chief Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg — a man so old-fashioned he could have been dug up by Time Team — wait to pounce. And Brexit is a mess. Things are so bad, even Elon Musk is out of ideas. No one will be happy with where we end up.And because there is no party political or Brexit majority in the Commons, politics is stuck, trapped in what feels like a never-ending Brexistential crisis.Normally, I’m with “Brenda From Bristol” when it comes to more elections and referendums.But maybe a People’s Vote on the final deal or another election is the only way to unblock Brexit.Think of it like a political plunger — unpleasant, nasty but necessary.You’d think the Opposition would be gleefully capitalising on all this chaos. Think again. Instead of going after the Tories, Labour has decided to traumatise the Jewish community. Again.Labour has had a horrible problem with anti-Semitism, yet instead of healing the wound, it has poured vinegar on it by choosing not to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance code of conduct.These guys sound pretty authoritative and the code is good enough for government departments and the Crown Prosecution Service.Many Jewish groups and leaders, including the Chief Rabbi, are distraught, confused and angry. And you can see why.This shameful decision led to an angry clash outside the Commons chamber where Jewish MP Margaret Hodge confronted Jeremy Corbyn, allegedly calling him an anti-Semite and a racist.Hodge lost family in the Holocaust and fought off the BNP in her Barking and Dagenham constituency.Instead of acknowledging her pain and offering to sit down with her, Team Corbyn are taking disciplinary action against her.I bet they deal with her far quicker than they did with Ken Livingstone, who couldn’t stop banging on about Hitler.What dark times for Labour, which once had a proud tradition of fighting racism. They must sort it out.Then we have the Lib Dems, who have proved useless. They have one policy — stop Brexit.Yet leader Vince Cable and ex-leader Tim Farron missed crucial votes on Monday. Talk about Dem and Dumber.To top it all off, the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jnr has been suspended for 30 days — which hasn’t happened since 1949 — for failing to declare lavish holidays to that well-known Northern Irish stakeholder, Sri Lanka.And to think Theresa May planned to give MPs an extra five days off as a reward for all their hard work.The country has had enough of these fools’ infighting, incompetence and filling their boots. Especially when we face so many big problems, from NHS funding to housing.Parliament’s end-of-term report is a big, fat fail. British politics should be taken into special measures.THE premiere of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was sun-kissed, frothy fun –  and no one mentioned the ­Customs Union. Bliss.The stars were out in full, including Cher. She is magnificent, but it is a little odd that at 72 she has fewer wrinkles than any other cast member, including 29-year-old Lily James. And the baby.She told Lorraine Kelly it was down to not drinking, smoking or doing drugs. Yeah, right.We women may be naive when it comes to the quest for eternal beauty, but we ain’t stupid.WHEN you hear of people getting up in the middle of the night and queuing, you think of the Boxing Day sales or the release of the latest Apple gadget.You don’t think of childcare.Yet more than 100 parents queued from 3am – armed with chairs, flasks and biscuits – trying to bag their child a coveted place in the breakfast club at a primary school in Cardiff.For many working parents, breakfast clubs are a lifeline.They can drop off the children in a safe environment where they can get a decent breakfast, then make it to work on time themselves.Though parents have the right to request flexible working hours, many fear the sack if they come in late.These spaces were limited and dished out on a first-come, first-served basis, which is why the parents took such drastic measures.This shows how desperate parents are for childcare that matches their working hours.The scrapping of Labour’s extended school programme and the first real-terms cuts to schools mean all these extras that were provided are no longer affordable.Childcare isn’t a luxury.It’s a necessity for millions of families and they are crying out for more breakfast and after-school clubs.JEFF BEZOS, the boss of Amazon, is a man clearly in his “Prime”.He’s now the richest man in modern history.Good for him.I’m all for celebrating entrepreneurs and hard work – but shouldn’t that apply to his poor workers toiling away in his warehouses?They would probably give Amazon working conditions zero stars.I wish our business leaders remembered some of their forefathers, who felt a moral and civic responsibility to look after their employees and took some pride in that.It makes business sense too. Happy workers are better workers.So after Bezos pops open the champagne, maybe he could spare a thought for his staff, who told an undercover reporter they pee in bottles because the loos are too far away and they are afraid of being accused of time-wasting.C’mon, Jeff – that’s really taking the p**s. ONE school in Liverpool had to apologise after kids as young as four were left in tears when they were denied an ice cream treat because they didn’t have a 97 per cent attendance record.How mean is that? What if they were ill? And surely it’s the parents’ fault.CARERS got another kick in the teeth this week when the Court of Appeal overturned a decision that those doing sleep-in shifts should earn at least the minimum wage.If the decision had gone through, it would have cost the UK care sector billions – so charities and local governments were relieved.But it shows what a raw deal carers get.Judges said only hours spent awake counted as work – but that is completely out of touch with the reality of what carers do.Many of the elderly and vulnerable people they look after need their help through the night, whether it’s a trip to the loo, to take medication or dealing with more serious situations such as seizures. Carers can’t exactly fall into a deep sleep.

The spread of social media and other online communication, with its inherent anonymity, has only increased the misery for victims.But the speed of change has not been matched by a more robust framework to deal with it.Yes, we have tougher sentences — the Government was absolutely right to last year double jail terms for the worst cases from five to ten years.But progress has been too slow in recognising these crimes.In 2016-17, fewer than 1,000 prosecutions were commenced under stalking legislation.It was horrifying to read the account of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud yesterday.She told how she faced a barrage of more than 3,000 texts over five years from an ex-boyfriend, including threats to stab and burn her.Soon after being handed a lifetime restraining order, her ex began following her on Instagram.He “wanted me to know he was still watching me”, she said, chillingly.And yet the CPS saw no realistic chance of a successful prosecution for stalking because the social media activity was not taken sufficiently seriously, despite the obvious impact on Nicola’s life.As she put it: “I should be able to move on from an unhealthy relationship if I want and that’s not been able to happen.”She wants change — and she is right to.These kinds of messages leave you in fear for your life — feeling that someone is watching or following you is immensely distressing.A bunch of flowers is not a romantic gesture when sent by a stalker but a reminder that your persecutor is still watching and can still reach you.Stalking is a crime of obsession and fixation and it needs to be stopped before it becomes deeply ingrained.No legislation will be effective unless it is accompanied by training at the front line of policing and across the wider courts system.Victims must have the confidence to come forward at an earlier stage, for all forms of stalking to be recognised for what they are. It is my intention to make this happen.My Stalking Protection Bill will introduce so-called Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) to help fill some of the gaps in the law.It will allow the police to act more quickly and to protect victims of so-called stranger stalking, where the stalker is not a former partner.Importantly, it will also take the onus off the victim to have to take action, as is currently the case for stranger stalking. At present many victims are left unprotected because they have to put protective measures in place for themselves, such as applying for a civil injunction to restrain someone from harassing them.Needless to say, many victims find this such a daunting task — not to mention expensive and time-consuming — that they end up not going through with it.If passed, the Stalking Protection Bill would allow the police to apply for an SPO through the magistrates’ courts on behalf of victims.Orders will require the civil standard of proof “on the balance of probabilities” but breach of an order would be a criminal offence, punishable in the most serious cases by a term of up to five years in prison.SPOs could set out requirements prohibiting certain behaviours, such as contacting the victim either directly or indirectly.It would be able to prohibit behaviours such as driving past the victim’s house, harassing friends, colleagues or family members, going within a certain distance of the victim or following them online.It could also set out so called positive requirements, such as attending a psychiatric assessment.In this digital age, the law would cover online contact from abroad and require that any IT equipment would be free from encryption, so perpetrators could not cover their tracks.Unlike the now-abandoned Police Information Notices, SPOs will have teeth, as they would be enforceable and breaching the terms of an order would have consequences.SPOs would also require stalkers to register all the names they use, as well as their address.While SPOs will provide better early intervention to protect victims, they are not intended to replace full prosecution for an offence of stalking.They will, however, enable police to better protect the safety of victims while gathering the full evidence for the CPS to prosecute a full stalking case.The Bill has almost completed its Commons journey but will not now return to the Chamber until late November.When the case for change is so pressing, and the Bill is backed by members across the House, I believe the Government should bring forward the final Commons stage so we can get on with delivering this vital change to the law — which will help to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They love the fact that obviously it is crooked, most of them do believe when they get here it will be just an illusion.“They appreciate the fact that we’ve kept it as it was, with its original features.“The illusion brings a lot of additional trade here at The Crooked House.

Hang on, rewind that. Genteel Norfolk a hotbed of sex?And lo and behold, two days after this revelation, a survey by our sister paper The Sun on Sunday revealed that the nookie capital of Britain is…drum roll…Norfolk.So quite what they’re putting in the water up there is anyone’s guess.But something tells me house prices are suddenly set to rise.Charlie, 45, told his brother Matthew on the phone: “I’d really like to go out for a bottle of wine.

He said: There was never a second secret White Paper” but “ministers had a series of papers before them”He insisted “there was not sudden twist in the road where one White Paper was done away with and another was written.”Dominic Raab is highly competent and a Brexiter. Naturally, he’s the last person No10 would want involved in talks.Instead our PM and her Remainiac aide Olly Robbins will do it. Raab’s sole role is preparing Britain for the outcome.We warned Mrs May after Chequers she will not survive one more breach of a red line. But we hoped Raab would be around to keep her and Robbins honest.The omens are grim.Tory Brexiteer Craig Mackinlay said: “Quietly somewhere was  a coup detat going on.”Labours Shadow Brexit Minister Jenny Chapman said: Dominic Raab has been sidelined by the prime minister before he has even had the chance to get his feet under the table.When Mrs May became Prime Minister in 2016 she promised that the negotiations with Brussels would be led by a Brexiteer.She said: I will create a new department responsible for conducting Britain’s negotiation with the EU.It will be led by a senior Secretary of State – and I will make sure that the position is taken by an MP who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The 27 EU states, or most of them at any rate, might individually want good relations with us.But, in Brussels, there are plenty of officials who would rather see all sides suffer than watch Brexit succeed.If their view prevails, the implications go well beyond Brexit. For 70 years, Britain has been a European power.Although we kept our military ties with the other English-speaking democracies, our focus was the defence of Europe. It still is.There are, for example, British soldiers patrolling the borders of Poland and Estonia.The RAF is, to all intents and purposes, acting as Romania’s air force, responding to incursions into that country’s airspace. And so on.In intelligence and security, rather as with the Common Fisheries Policy, Britain puts a lot more than its share into the common pot.We have done so cheerfully because we saw European states as our allies, and felt that we had a stake in their security. But what if that feeling is no longer reciprocated?Visiting Germany on Monday, Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, pointed out in measured and polite language that the EU could not expect to treat Britain aggressively without consequences.Now Mr Hunt is no Little Englander. He is an entrepreneur who made his money from language courses, is married to a Chinese woman and, after some soul-searching, came down on the side of Remain.But what he said is impossible to argue with. If the EU chooses to treat Brexit as a hostile act, the basis of European security will be undone — at the very moment that Donald Trump has made it clear that America is no longer interested in defending Europe.In almost every European speech since the referendum, Theresa May has said that she wants Britain to be the EU’s closest friend and strongest ally.But when have you ever heard those good wishes returned?The PM keeps saying she wants the EU 27 to succeed. EU leaders keep saying they want Brexit to fail.They mean it. Eurocrats are not offering Britain the kind of deal that they have with neighbours such as Norway and Switzerland.They think UK will just swallow what’s offered.If we want to remain in the single market, says chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, then, unlike those countries, we’d have to give Brussels 100 per cent control of our trade policy — an impossible condition.But neither are they offering the kind of simple free trade deal that they have with, say, Canada and Japan.If we want a straightforward trade deal, Barnier says, we’d have to leave Northern Ireland under EU rules — an equally impossible condition.In other words, Britain won’t be allowed the friendly relations with the EU that other democracies take for granted.It is not for a lack of willingness on our side. In February, Theresa May told a Munich audience: “Europe’s security is our security. And that is why I say that the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining it.”The EU’s response? To exclude us from the Galileo satellite programme on grounds that we could no longer be trusted.Well, fine. I never saw much point in the Galileo system, which was pushed by French leader Jacques Chirac to challenge the “technological imperialism” of America’s GPS system.Britain should now either go in with the Americans or create its own satellite system, possibly with friendly states such as Australia and Canada.But the point is, the EU’s logic goes well beyond satellites.If Brussels no longer sees us as an ally, we can hardly carry on behaving like one unilaterally, so to speak.While we talk of trade and co-operation, EU negotiators talk of border queues and grounded flights.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, even threatens to close his airspace.If such thinking wins out, we shall have no choice but to leave Europe to itself and turn our faces, as our ancestors did, to the open seas.That is not an outcome anyone should want, but we shall be ready if it comes.Understandably enough, you might say, given what feeble negotiators we have been so far. But Britain has a bad habit of switching from vague amiability to sudden resolve when it is almost too late.Such a moment is upon us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are seeking to avoid a no-deal Brexit, but departmental preparations are accelerating to ensure people’s health needs are provided in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Challenged about the prospect of a no-deal outcome, Mr Raab said that while there would be uncertainty in the short-term I think long-term actually we would still be able to thrive.But he risked a backlash after warning he had ‘no idea’ what would happen if Britain fails to negotiate a trade deal by the end of the transition phase in 2020 - adding “it was a good question.”Mr Raab told the committee it would be difficult to judge precisely when talks had reached a position where it was inevitable there would be no deal.Im confident we can avoid it with ambition, pragmatism and energy on both sides, he said.I cant give you a precise moment at which it will be clear that there is no deal.And he insisted the UK would not cower in talks with Brussels following concerns that a no-deal Brexit was becoming more likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I was drafted at a really young age and then when I was 17, 18, I broke my back and couldnt play anymore.“Then I got an opportunity to model. I worked for Levis, Versace, then I travelled the world for about nine, ten years. Around that time my parents where starting up the company that is known as Free Choice now.Ive been throwing parties for 22 years.

Soon we\u0027ll be receiving dramatic weekly warnings of the consequences of leaving the EU without agreement as time ticks down to an October deadline. Theresa May has personally taken charge of talks, and will issue 70 \u0027technical notices\u0027 on what\u0027ll happen if we\u0027re rudderless on 29 March 2019. Remainer MP Dominic Grieve has warned No Deal would prompt a state of emergency. Head of the civil service John Manzoni said it\u0027ll have horrendous consequences. Ireland warned even talking about it is inappropriate bravado. But despite all this, Mrs May\u0027s deputy, David Lidington, today boasted No Deal preparations are under way with vim and vigour. And Mrs May said: Far from being worried about preparations that we’re making, I would say people should take reassurance and comfort.    And let\u0027s not forget ex-Brexit Secretary David Davis, who promised it wouldn\u0027t be a Mad Max-style dystopia. So now we\u0027re closer to it actually happening, what do No Deal preparations actually involve? Here are a few of the more alarming ones - and you can guarantee you didn\u0027t see these on the side of a big red bus in 2016. 1. Food would be stockpiled  The government has all but confirmed food could be stockpiled if we crash out of the EU without a deal. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the government will be ensuring Britain has an adequate food supply. Indicating private firms, or others, could be the ones to stockpile food, he told MPs: It would be wrong to describe it as the Government doing the stockpiling. Mr Raab said further details will be set out in the 70 technical notices over summer. Reassuringly, Prime Minister Theresa May added today: This is not just about stockpiling. Presumably it’s M\u0026ampS stockpiling.  Food safety controls could be suspended at UK borders if Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal. It would prevent perishable goods being delayed at the border. But it could lead to EU countries blocking exports from the EU because of a cavalier approach to safety standards. Academics say they have been informed by a Government adviser of the plans being developed should delays emerge. Their testimony was contained this week in the Food Research Collaboration briefing, Feeding Britain: Food Security After Brexit . We have learned from a senior Government adviser that plans are being prepared to \u0027suspend food controls\u0027 if there are any delays to imports of perishable foods at our borders, they wrote.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock revealed plans to fly in medicines to treat millions of patients if there\u0027s no deal. The Cabinet minister said officials are drawing up the plans to import lifesaving drugs if ports are blocked, meaning they can\u0027t be shipped to the UK. He told MPs: We\u0027re working with industry to prepare for the potential need for stockpiling in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He added he was currently assessing how many months worth of medicines needed to be stockpiled, saying: We\u0027re also focussing on the importance of a continuous supply of medicines that have a short shelf-life. Some of the medicines that are most difficult to provide in a no deal scenario, where there is difficult access through ports, will need to be flown in, for instance. 37 million packs of medicines are imported to the UK from the EU every month, and the NHS is preparing for a doomsday scenario to prevent supplies running dry.  A No Deal Brexit could spark civil unrest within just two weeks, the UK head of Amazon warned - as he revealed the firm is planning for such an outcome. Doug Gurr allegedly made the shock comment to Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab during a business retreat at his grace-and-favour stately home Chevening. A source revealed the comment to the Times, and it was not denied by Amazon. Instead a spokesman said: Like any business, we consider a wide range of scenarios in planning discussions so that we’re prepared to continue serving customers and small businesses who count on Amazon, even if those scenarios are very unlikely. 5. Barges in the sea could have to keep the lights on  Plans emerged earlier this month to requisition thousands of generators from the Army and float them in the Irish Sea to keep Northern Ireland\u0027s lights on. The scheme was revealed in a government document seen by the Financial Times. It\u0027s because Northern Ireland and the Republic have a shared electricity supply and market under the terms of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement. In a worst-case scenario, it\u0027s claimed the Republic could cut off power to the north. After all, Irish Premier Leo Varadkar has already threatened to ban British planes from Irish airspace. He sparked a backlash after saying: The situation at the moment is that the UK is part of the Single European Sky and if they leave the EU they are not. If they want their planes to fly over our sky, they would need to take that into account.”  Around 7million people a year face going to the Post Office and paying a \u0026pound5.50 fee to take a day trip to France if there is a no deal Brexit. The National Audit Office revealed a plan to massively ramp up the number of International Driving Permits if the UK fails to reach agreement with the EU. Currently, Brits need the \u0026pound5.50 permits to drive in more than 140 countries outside the EU - and about 100,000 are issued per year. But serious backup plans are now under way to issue them to drivers who go to the EU too, the NAO said. This would hugely increase the number of IDPs issued per year, from 100,000 to an estimated 7million. The number of Post Offices that issue the permits would also have to increase massively, from the current 89 to 4,500 across the country. The NAO issued a blunt warning suggesting the plan may not be ready because as yet, there is no business case and no detailed delivery plans.  The M26 motorway - which joins London orbital M25 with the M20 port highway through Kent - could be turned into a 10-mile lorry park for 1,400 trucks. The plans are under consideration within government, according to the Financial Times, and Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab refused to deny their existence. He said: Well, no, but of course. If we have no deal, we want to make sure that we’re prepared at the border for the knock on effects that would have if on the EU side they take the worst case scenario approach, which is frankly irrational.

But writing on Twitter, he went further, suggesting: It is about time we brought the Treason Act up to date and made it apply to those seeking to destroy or undermine the British state.

He is a distant relative of former Liberal Prime Minister Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. In his spare time, he writes screenplays. Labour MP and Best for Britain supporter Virendra Sharma attacked the comments, saying: This C-list Tory MEP is suggesting putting the knife into free speech.

The couple, who do not wish to be named, arrived back at their Amsterdam house to find odd stains on the carpet and furniture. They claimed their entire house was left in a disgusting state, and were only made aware of what happened when police informed them they had visited the property. The couple said: There were white spots on the couch too and we did not really know what it could be. Unfortunately, the police then informed us about what the stains were.  The couple said police told them they had checked out the house after seeing the address listed in multiple ads on sex and prostitution websites. They said officers found three prostitutes in the house. They ordered them to close the unlicensed brothel, and gave them a few days to vacate the property. Cops say their powers were limited as the prostitutes were not illegal immigrants and were not the victims of human trafficking or forced prostitution. Prostitution is legal in the Netherlands, but sex workers and brothels have to be strictly regulated.  The couple had hired a specialist rental agency to hand the house keys to their Airbnb guests. The couple now say their house no longer feels like home knowing that men had sex with prostitutes in almost every room. They have been sleeping on an air bed because they cannot bear the thought of what had happened in their own bed.

The pranksters couldn\u0027t believe their luck when they put chewing gum in their sleeping pal\u0027s mouth - only for him to wake-up and keep chewing it. Groom-to-be Jamie Baker, 28, couldn\u0027t stop laughing as he videoed the hijinks between his brother, Rhys Baker and his mate, Jake Sandiford, both 19, on their way to his stag do in the party destination. Daring Rhys stealthily slid his used gum into Jake\u0027s gob as he slept open-mouthed in the middle of the flight on July 12. But the smooth prank was escalated to another level when an air stewardess woke Jake up to move his feet from the aisle and the bleary-eyed lad absent-mindedly started chewing the gum.  Despite playing pranks all flight long, poor Jake hadn\u0027t suspected any foul-play and didn\u0027t realise the group\u0027s hysterics were because he was munching on pre-chewed gum. He even offered the group a cheeky grin as they burst into laughter around him. Jamie claims it wasn\u0027t until the group had landed in Magaluf and boarded a coach that they revealed the deception to unwitting Jake - and he branded them \u0027disgusting\u0027. The video immediately went viral when it was shared online at the weekend, with 3.4million views and 85,000 likes, comments and shares. Jamie, from Radcliffe, Greater Manchester, said: We just did it for a laugh. There were a few pranks on us all. This was probably halfway through the flight. It\u0027s the air stewardess that makes it when she wakes him up. She couldn\u0027t have timed it any better. I couldn\u0027t breathe - I was laughing my head off. It was hilarious. Jake thought we were laughing because the air stewardess woke him up. He chewed the gum all the way there. We left him to it.  It was about another hour or so for the rest of the flight. He had nowhere to put it on the plane, so that\u0027s why it ended up going all the way to Magaluf. Jake didn\u0027t realise until we got on the coach [in Magaluf] and that was when we laughed and showed him the video. He was fuming and saying that it was disgusting. He was fine though. He\u0027s a good sport anyway. The stag do was quality. I said to the lads I think we peaked too soon. We were laughing all the way there about the video. I\u0027m really overwhelmed by the response [to the video]. I wasn\u0027t expecting anything like that. Everyone\u0027s going mad about all the notifications they\u0027re getting. Jake really does think he\u0027s on top of the world because all his friends and bosses have seen it and everything. He thinks he\u0027s a celebrity.

Loujain Al-Hathloul, 28, is among nine women held during a brutal crackdown in May just as the desert kingdom was about to allow women to drive for the first time. At the time campaigners were bidding to use the lifting of the driving ban as a springboard for further reforms such as ending Saudi Arabia’s restrictive male ship system and allowing more freedom of speech. But instead they were rounded up, thrown in jail and now face charges of treason that carry the harshest prison sentence, or even the death penalty. Kareem Chehayeb, Saudi Arabia researcher for Amnesty International, said: The Saudi authorities don’t want any change to come from below. They want to stifle any form of dissent or human rights activism.  It appears that the only reforms that are acceptable are those that are coming from above, which is absolutely outrageous. Al-Hathloul’s arrest came two years after she attended a One Young World humanitarian summit with the then Meghan Markle, Emma Watson, Cher as well as the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau. In one picture Meghan was in a group of four posing by the water’s edge with Al-Hathloul, the poet Fatima Bhutto and former President of Ireland, Mary Robinson. Writing about the summit at the time Meghan said: One Young World invites young adults from all over the world who are actively working to transform the socio-political landscape by being the greater good. They are delegates who are speaking out against human rights violations, environmental crises, gender equality issues, discrimination and injustice. They are the change. In March al-Hathloul, who has 316,000 Twitter followers, was stopped by police as she drove near her university in Abu Dhabi and put on a plane back to Saudi Arabia where she was banned from leaving the country or using social media. Despite not posting any more Tweets, she was among seven Saudis detained two months later, five women and two men who had supported their cause, including a lawyer who had represented al-Hathloul in the past.

It comes as thousands have been flocking to beaches to enjoy sun, sea and sand - with an ice cream or two. But the Met Office has issued a warning for people to stay inside, check their elderly neighbours are coping with the heat, and keep windows closed during the day. Parts of the UK are currently experiencing an \u0027level 3 heat health watch warning\u0027 - level 4 means a national emergency has been declared and there may be a danger to life. And people are being urged to try to stay out of the sun between 11am and 3pm. Nurses have also warned that some hospital wards have reached more than 30C, leading to patients and relatives passing out or vomiting. Meanwhile, the Met Office has revealed that on Friday England could see the July record high of 36.7C reached at Heathrow in 2015.  The all-time UK high is 38.5C which was set in August 2003. However it\u0027s not good news for some parts of the country on Friday as it may be time to finally being out your brollies. Thunderstorms and torrential downpours are expected from 2pm in parts of the East Midlands, East of England, North East, North West, London and South East England, and Yorkshire and Humber. It\u0027s prompted the Met Office to put a yellow warning in place. It comes after England has been weeks without rain and as much as 30mm (1.2in) is expected to fall in just an hour. There\u0027s also a chance of hail and strong winds as the temperature could drop back to the high 20s, meteorologist Alex Burkill said. Cavendish, in Suffolk, was the hotspot on Tuesday with the temperature reaching 31.4C, 23C higher than the lowest temperature recorded, at Drumnadrochit, near Loch Ness in the Highlands, at 8C.  Today is due to be warmer, with temperatures of 33C expected in East Anglia and the south-east. The Local Government Association said social workers, community wardens and maintenance staff are all on high alert to identify those who could be struggling in the heat.  And pet owners have been urged to avoid exercising their dogs and other animals in the hottest parts of the day due to the risk of burnt paws on scorching pavements, as well as the chance of heatstroke.  As the harvest begins early in many places following the driest first half of summer on record, farming leaders warned crops are being hit. They added that reservoirs for watering vegetables were running dry and livestock owners were having to use winter feed for their animals as summer grass had withered away. The heatwave baking Britain comes as extreme hot weather grips northern Europe.

The firm wants to take water from Lakes Windermere, Ullswater and Ennerdale after forecasters warned the heatwave could last until September. Britain has been experiencing an extended spell of warm weather with temperatures set to hit 35C by the end of the week. The news comes after The Mirror revealed how United Utilities water bosses pocketed \u0026pound180million dividend despite losing quarter of supply through leaks. The biggest shareholder windfall comes as seven million United Utilities customers across the North West of England face restrictions on the water they use in their homes from August 5.  Now water bosses want to pump supplies from the Lake District as shortages are expected due to the heat. The North West is the hardest hit region as it relies on surface water which evaporates in a heat wave. Utilities United now want six-month drought permits so they can take water from Lakes Windermere and Ullswater, reports The Sun. They have also requested a permit to pump more water from Ennerdale, which feeds a conservation area, which would last three months. The firm wants to take an extra 51million litres from Ullswaterd and 24million litres from Windermere, up from 300million and 200million per day respectively.  Utilities United currently loses 430million litres every day due to leaks in their system. The Environment Agency will decide within the coming days whether to grant the permits. Martin Padley, United Utilities Water Services Director, said: “Applying for drought permits is not a decision we have taken lightly. “We are working closely with the Environment Agency to ensure that water supplies are protected for both customers and the environment.” Environment Agency Drought Manager Jim Ratcliffe stressed: “Any drought permit would only be issued to United Utilities after public \u0026shyconsultation and a review of all the available data.” As the heatwave continues, those who hose parched gardens or fill paddling pools for kids to cool down in during the long school holidays face a \u0026pound1,000 fine.  Households are also urged to take shorter showers to help save water – while the equivalent of a bath and a half per household is wasted through leaking pipes that United have failed to plug. United Utilities was handed an \u0026pound8million “under-performance” penalty last year and it lost 25% of supplies through leaking pipes. The firm said its total dividend of 39.73p a share is in line with a “five-year growth policy” of payouts that rise in line with retail price inflation. The company has handed more than \u0026pound1billion to investors in the last four years alone. Meanwhile, the UK will swelter through another baking hot summer day today with temperatures hitting as high as 30 degrees in some parts of England. London and the South East will see the highest temperatures and could beat Tuesday\u0027s high of 31.4C (88.5F), recorded in Cavendish, Suffolk. The Met Office says the overall forecast for the country is fairly mixed, with northerly areas experiencing cooler temperatures and cloudier conditions.  In Birmingham , sunshine could turn hazy at times, but UV levels will still be high as temperatures rise to 27 \u0026degC. Manchester and Liverpool will see the mercury rise to 25C but will see some broken sunshine from midday. Glasgow and Edinburgh will likely see highs of 21C due to the much heavier cloud cover blocking much of Scotland. An amber heat health watch warning remains in place for parts of England, with people being warned to try to stay out of the sun between 11am and 3pm. Pet owners have been urged to avoid exercising their dogs and other animals in the hottest parts of the day due to the risk of burnt paws on scorching pavements, as well as the chance of heatstroke.

It comes as five Supreme Court justices upheld rulings by a Family Court judge and Court of Appeal judges. Mrs Owens, 68, wants a divorce and says her marriage to Mr Owens, who is 80, is loveless and has broken down. She says he has behaved unreasonably and that she should not reasonably be expected to stay married. But a judge at an earlier hearing found Mrs Owens’ 27 examples of her husband \u0027being moody and argumentative\u0027 were \u0027flimsy and exaggerated.\u0027  Mr Owens has refused to agree to a divorce and denies Mrs Owens\u0027 allegations about his behaviour. He says if their marriage has irretrievably broken down it is because she had an affair, or because she is bored. Mr and Mrs Owens married in 1978 and lived in Broadway, Worcestershire, judges have heard. Mrs Owens petitioned for divorce in 2015 after moving out. Supreme Court justices analysed rival legal arguments, which revolved around concepts of unreasonable behaviour and fault, at a Supreme Court hearing in London in May and delivered a ruling on Wednesday. One, Lord Wilson, said justices had ruled against Mrs Owens with reluctance. He said the question for Parliament was whether the law governing entitlement to divorce remained satisfactory.  Lord Wilson indicated that Mrs Owens would be able to divorce in 2020, when the couple have been separated for five years. Another, Supreme Court president Lady Hale, said she found the case very troubling. But she said it was not for judges to change the law. Mrs Owens had already lost two rounds of the battle. In 2016 she failed to persuade a Family Court judge to allow her to divorce. Last year three appeal judges ruled against her after a Court of Appeal hearing in London. They said Mrs Owens had failed to establish that her marriage had, legally, irretrievably broken down and dismissed her challenge to a ruling by Judge Robin Tolson. One appeal judge said she reached her conclusion with no enthusiasm whatsoever but that Parliament would have to decide whether to introduce no fault divorce on demand.

Louise Sach, 28, had reached a stalemate in her search for a donor after being told her kidney function was starting to seriously deteriorate last year. In a last bid to find a match, Louise set up a Facebook page to see if she could attract a donor. The HR worker said she hoped an old friend or colleague might come forward. The last thing she expected was a complete stranger to give her the kidney she so badly needed. Incredibly, that\u0027s exactly what happened. Kayleigh Wakeling, 33, from Hertfordshire stepped forward and now the two are best friends.  Louise said: A year ago they told me I really needed to find a kidney. I never asked anyone. I didn\u0027t want to put anyone under undue pressure. I thought it might be a work college or someone I had met but didn\u0027t know I needed a kidney who came forward on Facebook. I never expected someone I had never met to offer. Kayleigh didn\u0027t have a particular reason that made her want to help me. She just saw something she could do to help someone else. She told me \u0027It just felt like the right thing to do and I knew I could do it.\u0027 Louise\u0027s last three potential donors tested negative for a match in September 2017, leaving her facing years of dialysis up to five times a week unless someone could be found. It was the news Louise had been dreading for 20 years since doctors found she was in renal failure aged eight and wouldn\u0027t make it through adulthood without a transplant.  I had now had all of my best friends and closest family tested, and we were left horrified and shocked at the news that, despite knowing for 20 years this time would come, the time had arrived, and I had no kidney donor she said. Louise was added to the deceased donor list but realised she could facing years of waiting lists, uncertainty and waiting to get \u0027the call\u0027. All the while having to rely on a dialysis machine to keep her alive, something she felt would cripple her life. Already in the last year she noticed a serious deterioration in her health and suffered severe cramps, nausea and would pass out. But Louise decided she wouldn\u0027t give up. It was two friends she met online and their stories that inspired her to turn her search online: Richie Sully and Lisa Emmott. Richie reached out online and gave his kidney to Rob Leibowitz, who hit headlines after he walked around Disneyland Florida wearing a t-shirt stating he needed a kidney Together with kidney awareness advocate Lisa, they helped Louise set up her Facebook page in January this year. Louise made a Facebook post talking about her struggle and how she urgently needed an O blood group kidney donor.

But for one teenager her love of Hot Cheetos went too far - and ended with her needing her gallbladder removed. That\u0027s according to her mother, who thinks her addiction had something to do with her health problems. Rene Craighead, 17, of Memphis, Tennessee, was reportedly eating four large bags of hot snacks a week when she began having stomach pain. She was taken to the hospital and underwent surgery to remove her gallbladder. Her mother, also called Rene, claims the doctor told her the flaming crisps were the root cause of her daughter\u0027s problem.  She told WREG-TV : When my daughter had to have this surgery I knew I had to tell everybody about it.  I was very surprised that my daughter was sick like that.   Rene reportedly would ask her mother to bring the snacks home with her and would take bags to school. According to the NHS, the gallbladder is a small organ in the upper right part of your tummy that stores bile and helps break down fatty foods. Surgery is usually needed if the patient develops painful gallstones. These can cause stomach pain, nausea and jaundice. An operation to remove a gallbladder is said to be routine and relatively straightforward - and you also don\u0027t need your gallbladder to survive. The makers of Cheetos told CBS News: At Frito-Lay, food safety is always our number one priority, and our snacks meet all applicable food safety regulations as well as our rigorous quality standards. Some consumers may be more sensitive to spicy foods than others and may choose to avoid spicier snacks due to personal preference.

But while lots of people enjoy eating oysters, it seems there\u0027s one thing people don\u0027t really know about them. And that\u0027s that raw oysters, the kind served on ice with a wedge of lemon, are still alive. It\u0027s no secret, but it\u0027s something that people are still disturbed to learn. Learning the truth has led to lots of questions on social media, including if oysters feel pain when we eat them.  One person wrote on Twitter: Just read that raw oysters are still alive when you eat. Thank god I don\u0027t eat shellfish. Another added: I just found out that oysters are alive when you eat them and I feel really guilty I’m gonna cry. Despite the fact that it sounds incredibly gross and cruel, it\u0027s actually better for you to eat them in this way. That\u0027s because dead oysters which are eaten raw can contain bacteria that is harmful to humans and can make us ill - with symptoms including a fever, vomiting and diarrhoea. Do oysters feel pain when you eat them?  Seafish , an organisation set up to raise standards in the seafood industry, say that the debate of whether or not oysters feel pain is still ongoing.      A spokesman told : Unfortunately there\u0027s no definitive proof either way.  There are groups that argue oysters might feel pain, and others who say because they don\u0027t have a central nervous system then they don\u0027t feel pain in the way other seafood species might. We currently don\u0027t have research in this area. When do they die? As for when exactly they die, this is also up for debate - is it when they are shucked? Or when you eat them? Seafish have a theory about this as well. This is likely to happen when they are shucked, rather than when they are chewed or swallowed. They think this because an oyster\u0027s heart is right next to the bottom adductor muscle, so separating it from the shell kills it.

However, there were so many laughs and great times had along the way and once they crossed the finish line, I know they were so glad they took part. I can never thank them enough for this.”Fiona, 32, added: “There were some points where we weren’t sure if everyone was going to finish – our chat group was full of messages saying: ‘We can’t do this’.“But everyone who started made it to the end – including the one girl in the group, who was a real trooper. I love them all for what they’ve done.”She added that Jenny – who has campaigned for MECP2 research for several years – has become a “firm friend”.She added: “It was an honour to spend six days with her. She’s such an inspiration. She was a rock.”In all, the team have raised £15,000 – more than three times the original target of £5,000 – not including a £1,000 donation from a pharmaceutical company direct to Reverse Rett.The charity thanked the cyclists on Facebook, writing: “Thank you all for your amazing support.”The team’s fundraising progress can be viewed at justgiving/companyteams/blaketocharlie.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51aaeebafbd-480x564.jpg ","title":"betfred cup ties remain vital as dundee united work to get going","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor Dundee United, this season’s Betfred Cup looks all but over but don’t trying telling stand-in skipper Stewart Murdoch the final two group fixtures are meaningless.The 28-year-old knows today\u0026#8217s Tannadice clash with Alloa and next week’s trip to Elgin will be vital games as the Tangerines work to make sure they are a force in the coming Championship campaign.And while the ties so far against Arbroath and Ross County have ended in disappointment in terms of results, he believes they provided proof they’re heading in the right direction.“I think the thing is it’s really early doors and the manager will tell you we are still building, that’s maybe why we haven’t had the results we wanted,” he said.“We are still basically in a pre-season phase, so, for us, Tuesday was a really good competitive game up at County and gave us an opportunity to see exactly where we are right now.“It was another 90 minutes for the lads together and to help get to know each other. When you get the penalty at 0-0 and late on, if you score you probably go on and see out the game.“We didn’t and it was disappointing to lose but at the same time everybody could see the other night that already we can compete and we can take that forward. Now we move on to the next game.”And that need to be ready for next month’s league kick-off against Dunfermline means, for Murdoch and his team-mates, the next two outings are massive.“It will be difficult to qualify from our group now but we will take every game the same way we’ve always done and that’s as big ones.“We probably need to win both games now to have any chance and that’s what we’ll aim to do.“And they are another two big games leading into the start of the season in the Championship. We can get match sharpness and we will have another few boys who’ve had wee injuries back available.“It’s also another opportunity as well for the gaffer to maybe tinker with the team a bit and get boys some game time.”And, despite what the Betfred group table suggests, his belief this rebuilt United side is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the second tier, is growing.“I think everyone is confident we are building a good team and the manager will be wanting a few more players – I’m sure he’d said that.“I think the more good players we add the better we’ll play and the more we play together the better we’ll become.“It gave us confidence going to a place like County and competing the way we did. It was a good performance, it was just the result that was poor.“We are all excited about the season ahead and I think it’s going to be a positive one.”In the absence of newly-appointed club captain Fraser Fyvie, who’s likely to be out for another month or so as he completes his recovery from knee surgery at the turn of the year, the games so far have seen Murdoch wear the captain’s armband.Well aware of United’s history and some of the greats who’ve undertaken the role, he regards even having it on a temporary basis as a big feather in his cap.“I was captain a couple of times towards the end of last season and to be handed it again while Fraser is still out is nice,” he added.“This is a massive club, so to lead Dundee United out in any game is a huge honour for me.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csaba laszlo urging dundee united to speed up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo wants Dundee United to speed up when their Betfred Cup campaign continues at home to Alloa today.Despite a draw and a penalty shoot-out loss against Arbroath and a narrow defeat at Ross County in the two group ties so far, Csaba has been pleased with the signs coming from his rebuilt Tangerines.The next step forward he wants to see, though, is quicker use of the ball leading to more chances being created.“If I watch the team, Matej Rakovan, Adam Barton, Christoph Rabitsch, Callum Booth and others, they are really good football players,” he said.“They keep the ball well and have some good ideas, but we have to do more in the offence.“You can’t just control the game, you also have to go and finish, bring more danger in front of the opponent’s goal, be quicker.“I told them that for the second half at Ross County, ‘OK we are comfortable with the ball but we have to bring more danger’.”Fraser Aird will be in the squad after he sat out the County trip.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"disappointed dundee united boss csaba focuses on dunfermline in league opener","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United boss Csaba Laszlo was disappointed by his team’s latest Betfred Cup disappointment at the weekend.But he’s reminded fans that it’s all about being ready to win matches when the Championship season kicks off against Dunfermline next week.For the third group stage tie in a row, Saturday saw the Tangerines fail to record a victory as they were held to a draw by Alloa over 90 minutes and then lost the bonus point penalty shootout.It means they have no chance of progressing to the knockout stages and Csaba admitted he was angered by aspects of the performance, particularly during a second half that saw United let the lead slip late on.He isn’t, though, losing sight of the bigger picture.“Again, like the last game, until 80 minutes we are even in front in the game and then make a stupid mistake,” he said.“In the first half I think generally the team played some good football but the second half, according to me, this was not what I want to see. Definitely not.“I think this was to do with the changes we had to make and because we didn’t keep the ball in the front and be more simple.“Nicky Clark was tired and James Keatings has just come back from an injury so he got tired.

I’ve come down from Inverness to pay my respect, and I’ll be raising a drink in his memory tonight.”Born in Coupar Angus, Gilzean is considered one of the finest players to grace Dens Park and netted an unrivalled 169 goals during the halcyon days of the 1950s and 60s.His eye for a goal was a crucial factor in Dundee’s title-winning season in 1961-62, before the club went on to reach the semi-final of the European Cup.Season ticket holder George McLaren, 73, said: “He has been such a big part of Dundee FC. My favourite memories of him are probably the goals against Dundee United.“I was shocked to hear of his passing and wanted to come here today to pay my respects. He will never be forgotten. He proved himself here at Dens and at Spurs.“An absolute legend for both clubs.”Fellow fan Daniel Smith, 33, from Maryfield, added: “There’s been a good turnout of people paying their respects here today at Dens.“He is a Dundee legend. I grew up on stories about Gilzean through the years and the things he accomplished at Dens. He still holds a number of records at Dens Park.”A tribute on the Dundee FC website stated: “Everyone at Dundee Football Club was devastated to learn of the death of Dundee legend Alan Gilzean aged 79 after a short illness.“A true Dundee legend in every sense of the word, we may never see his goal scoring like again and the thoughts of everyone at Dens Park are with Alan’s family and friends at this difficult and sad time.”He made the jump from Tayside to Tottenham in 1964 for a £72,500 fee, lifting two League Cups, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.As well as the dark blue of Dundee, Hall of Famer Gilzean earned 22 Scotland caps between 1963 and 1971, bagging 12 goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f13f2179a.jpg ","title":"dundee people all aboard thehms unicornfor family fun","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSwashbuckling pirates stormed the HMS Unicorn as people of all ages turned out for the vessel’s summer family fun day.Youngsters dressed up and got the chance to meet unofficial mascot Pirate Bob.Children also had their faces painted and took part in sand art activities.There was even a special curator’s tour of the Music of Maritime Life.Billy Rough, education officer at the Unicorn, said: “It was such a fantastic day.“It was incredibly busy despite it being a glorious sunny day.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f0eac1ff6.jpg ","title":"dundee people pop up shop peps up charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA pop-up ladies boutique in Broughty Ferry has raised several thousand pounds for charity.The shop in Gray Street has raised £7,600 for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust (CFT) in just two weeks.Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and other organs.Morag Beckett, who set up the shop, said: “It’s been brilliant.

He played the guitar and drums, he’d been in pipe bands, tried to start up his own band, played piano and he could read music.“And he played basketball, he helped at the D\u0026ampA, he volunteered, he was an advocate for mental health, had finished his HND in petroleum engineering – he did everything.“He was a tall, broad guy, with a huge grin.“Everywhere he went, everybody knew he was coming.”Born in south-east London, Josh moved up to Scotland when he was still young and immediately set to work befriending everyone he met.Friend John King, who met Josh at D\u0026ampA College, said: “Within five minutes of meeting him he was your best friend.“He just loved life, being around everyone – and loved banter. Total banter, all the time.”Craig Nicoll, who works at the D\u0026ampA as a sports and wellbeing officer, said Josh was his “best friend” at both work and play.“He took what he did very seriously, and he was very good at it,” he said. “He could throw himself into anything.”“Last year one of the workers came in with a Santa costume for the kids at Christmas. We volunteered him for it – and he did it. You could depend on him. You could fill a novel with stories about him.”His girlfriend, Yvonne Nessel, said Josh had the rare ability to befriend everyone he met.She said: “He had friends everywhere – Dundee, Dunfermline – even people he hadn’t seen in years from school, and thousands on Facebook.“He had taken up fishing again a couple of weeks ago at Balmule Fishing Club and there’s already talk of them putting a plaque up there for him. After two weeks.”Paulette added: “Some people could be around for a year and you wouldn’t know them as well as you’d know him within two weeks.”The issue of mental health was one of great importance to Josh.However, he kept his own issues deeply private among only a handful of his closest friends – friends who said the happiness of others always came before his own.John added: “He was so focused on everyone else. It makes me sad, knowing that he could make so many people happy, but couldn’t make himself happy. But we always had his back.”Josh will be commemorated at a special 18+ event at Industry nightclub in Dundee, where he worked.The Friday night event, from 10pm, will play his favourite music and raise money for a trust in his name promoting positive mental health among men.Yvonne said: “It’s important for him to have a legacy.

It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me.

the discussions.There have been nine meetings to date.Three more are scheduled to follow.The board has hit back, insisting that \"organisational change is managed within existing resources\".Such a

security staff is low while general staff safety has become an increasing concern at the north of Scotland\u0027 largest hospital.It is furious that the lengthy review of staff cover within the

process has so far cost taxpayers \u0026pound7808.34.It prompted her to ask: \"How many operations would that pay for?\"Ms Gordon said: \"The security staff cover a 32-acre site and have an increasingly challenging job.\"The statistics show that aggression and the threat of violence is escalating not diminishing.\"It\u0027 suspected that the board want to save money by getting security guards to undertake more of the work done by the porters, and vice versa.\"Equally, nursing is going to be expected to call upon the security guards less frequently and, therefore, do more themselves.\"She added: \"Police Scotland will be looked upon as a resource but their new triaging system will prevent this.\"Portering is literally run off its feet.\"It is covering an average of

The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 5:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116731.jpg","title":"New cinema proposed for the Black Isle","story":"\u0026nbspA THRIVING film society on the Black Isle looks set to take its next big step after plans were submitted for a permanent cinema to cater for growing demand.The brand new cinema, which would be located on the seafront in Cromarty, will cater to Cromarty and Resolis Film Society events and serve as a base for the town\u0027 increasingly popular annual film festival.Cromarty Estate, which owns the land, has lodged the application in partnership the film society, which would act as its tenant.The plans feature two key elements. The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.The cinema would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0027 growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country late every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.In a supporting statement submitted by the estate alongside its application, its agents said: \"A dedicated cinema space will allow screening all year which currently is not possible using existing buildings with poor black out facilities.\"The cinema may also be available for other users to hire for screenings, presentations and lectures.\"They added that the cinema would also \"ideally\" feature an outdoor area \"for summer screenings and festival events\".Making the case for new office space in the town, the estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"In a statement supporting the application, the film society said that a survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.Justifying the decision to proceed with an all-new site for the cinema, the estate\u0027 agents said the site\u0027 position close to adequate parking and its location away from homes were both positives, as was the existing vehicle access from the harbour.The buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.If the plans are approved construction could start as early as spring next year.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 5:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116735.jpg","title":"Pamiloo to make its first visit to Black Isle Show","story":"\u0026nbspCAMPAIGNERS have welcomed news that accessible toilets will be installed at this year\u0027 Black Isle Show \u0026ndash allowing people with complex needs to enjoy the event.Fiona MacLeod-Chiarini, whose brother Ewan MacLeod is severely disabled, contacted the show\u0027 organisers to ask about the availability of a Pamiloo (right), a mobile facility for those with profound impairments.Rod Mackenzie, the Black Isle Show\u0027 company secretary, immediately got in touch with the charity Promoting a More Inclusive Scotland (Pamis), which owns the Pamiloo, in order to make the event accessible for the family.Mrs MacLeod-Chiarini hailed the move, and believes facilities such as the Pamiloo can be life-changing.She said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the Black Isle Show have taken our concerns on board and have booked the Pamiloo.

They are a professional outfit and they won’t be taking us lightly.“It’s something we as a club need to try to do, try to compete and better teams that have bigger budgets than us.“We’ve done that and Burnley have done that and they’ve had a lot of coverage about what they’ve done.”He added: “It’s difficult to compare them to teams in Scotland because Celtic and Rangers have huge budgets as well.“Celtic have won the league comfortably but we have competed. And we’ve beaten Rangers in the last couple of seasons and they have a bigger budget than us.“I think Sean Dyche and the Burnley team have proven it’s not all about the size of the budget it’s about the players and hopefully we can show that ourselves.“We have a lot of belief in the team that we can do that.“The quality in the dressing room is enough that we’re confident we can get through the tie.”It is often said the game in Scotland is not rated highly by football observers in England and many are viewing this tie as a chance for Aberdeen to show Scottish football is better than some might think.Lewis, a former England squad keeper, had spent his whole career down south before joining the Reds two years ago.The former Peterborough, Cardiff, Blackpool and Fulham custodian has been on both sides of the divide.He believes it is hard to compare Scotland and England but he does think the tie gives the Dons a great opportunity to show how good they are and how good the Scottish Premiership is.Lewis said: “Before I came up here I didn’t follow a great deal of Scottish football.“But now having seen both sides of it I can see that they are very different.“The Championship in England is a very tough league and the Premier League is another kettle of fish.“It’s hard to compare the two because there are different obstacles and different mentalities required in the different leagues.“Down there sometimes you can go away to small grounds and there aren’t many fans and it’s as much a mental test as anything, can you deal with it?“Then here when you play the likes of Rangers, Celtic, Hibs and Hearts it’s a different situation.“It’s big crowds and can you produce in the high pressure situations? It’s difficult to compare and say what people think of the standard here.”He added: “But I have enjoyed playing up here immensely and this tie is a good chance to test ourselves against Burnley, showcase our skills and show what we’re about.“We have finished second in our league for the last four seasons.“There will be plenty of eyes watching the games and looking at exactly how good we are and how good Scottish football is.“Hopefully we can prove ourselves and show them what we are all about.”So far this summer Dons boss Derek McInnes has signed midfielders Chris Forrester, Stephen Gleeson and Lewis Ferguson, as well as Dominic Ball, who can play in defence or midfield.Tommie Hoban was brought in on a season-long loan this morning, while Lewis now has senior back-up \u0026#8211 with Tomas Cerny brought in on a one-year deal.Lewis believes the squad is shaping up nicely ahead of taking on Burnley.He said: “I’m sure the manager is still looking to bring players in.

We’ve got a very strong team and hopefully we can build on that.“It’s shaping up well and we’re enjoying ourselves.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"chairman milne calling on dons to make their mark for city and country","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPittodrie chairman Stewart Milne insists the Europa League clash with Burnley is a chance to show the strength of both Aberdeen and Scottish football.The Dons face the English Premier League Clarets in a second qualifying round first leg Battle of Britain at Pittodrie tomorrow.Milne accepts Scottish football will be under the microscope with the return leg next Thursday at Turf Moor set to be broadcast live by BT Sport.Burnley, who today arrived in the Granite City, finished seventh in the English top flight and are rated as favourites by bookmakers to progress to a third qualifying round clash with Turkish side Istanbul Basaksehir.However, with the focus of British football on the tie, Milne claimed the Reds have the belief they can upset the odds.He said: “This is an opportunity to profile Aberdeen as a football club, and the Scottish game.“Nobody is underestimating the scale of the challenge that Burnley will pose.“However, equally it is a game where the belief will be there that we can go out and win it and get through into the next round.”The Euro double header heralds a high-profile and high- stakes beginning to Aberdeen’s campaign.Just days after the return at Turf Moor the Reds kick-off their domestic season with a Premiership clash against Rangers at Pittodrie on Sunday August 5.Milne said: “There is a lot at stake in those three initial games, particularly the European ones.“Derek (McInnes) feels it will be a big challenge but it is certainly not beyond us.“Hopefully we can get the right result.”Aberdeen have exited the Europa League at the third qualifying stage in the last four seasons.The Reds will have to despatch Burnley to match that this year and take a step closer to the target of the group stages – which brings a minimum £3 million payment.In the long term the Reds have ambitions to break into the UEFA top 100 club list. Delivering the £50 million stadium and training facilities at Kingsford are a key component to that.Aberdeen broke ground on the £10m training ground earlier this month.Milne said: “It (training ground) is a big part of the jigsaw although there are a lot of things we can do to make sure we become a top 100 club.“Fundamental to the whole thing is having the right facilities and keeping that momentum going on the football front.“We have got to grow in strength in the club itself and be able to generate a lot more money as the club moves forward.“Having a facility like that just underpins the whole club.“It would be very difficult for us to be part of whatever the European future is going to be without having top class facilities like that.”Dons boss McInnes has secured six new signings this summer in preparation for the Euro tilt – Stephen Gleeson, Chris Forrester, Lewis Ferguson and Tomas Cerny on permanents and Dominic Ball on loan from Rotherham and Tommie Hoban on loan from Watford.He aims to have more new additions on board for the Rangers clash with his main priority being a striker.McInnes also wanted to further strengthen his squad for the clash with Burnley.He had a bid for Doncaster striker John Marquis, understood to be £250,000, rejected.It is understood that move is not completely dead in the water and could yet be revisited.Aberdeen also reportedly had a bid of £300,000 for Preston striker Eoin Doyle fall through because the 30-year-old could not agree personal terms.The Reds could yet launch a loan bid for Preston striker Louis Moult, who they attempted to sign from Motherwell last summer.The Dons lost out to League One Sunderland in the race to land Scotland international midfielder Dylan McGeouch.McInnes was also keen on securing Ross County full-back Jason Naismith but he opted to join Peterbrough United, also of League One.But McInnes insists despite the hurdles he has to overcome in the transfer market, his squad will be competitive against the Clarets.McInnes said: “We’ve lost out on several players to League One already this season and I don’t think that should be the case.“A lot of the reasons are financial for players and unfortunately there are clubs who surpass what we can do.“But that’s always been the case, and we’ve always managed to put a competitive squad together.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen skateboard company aims to create lasting legacy in doric","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDoric Skateboards hope to bring a sense of community to the skate scene in Aberdeen.The online retailer, which entered this year’s Evening Express Retailer Awards, hopes to scoop top spot in the Specialist Retailer category.Owner Gary Kemp launched Doric Skateboards in March 2017.Gary, who got his first skateboard when he was just eight years old, aims to create a skateboard brand the north-east can be proud of.He is heavily influenced by Aberdeen, its buildings and history.Gary – who also works for Optimus Aberdeen as project controls manager – said: “My inspiration comes from the city and everything I have soaked up over my life.“I was raised to have an interest in the history of Aberdeen and it has stuck with me.”The creative owner, who loves “interacting with customers and getting a new design kicked off”, would describe his business as “friendly, inclusive and determined”.To Gary, excellent customer service is all about “engagement, availability and being more than a standard set answer”.The businessman is a big fan of clean, symmetrically pleasing design.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

It is also the story of a family trying to reunite cousins on both sides of the Atlantic.Except this is not fiction. This is the mysterious story of James Campbell Hay Robertson, known as Jim, who was born and raised in Lochgilphead, and who was so determined to make a fresh start in America that he never saw or spoke to his Scottish family again.Why Jim would cut himself off from his family is something his granddaughter Morgan has been trying to find out and she has asked the Argyllshire Advertiser to help solve this mystery.James Campbell Hay Robertson was born in Lochgilphead and lived in Calman Villa in Ardrishaig. He was the son of the schoolmaster, a noted talent on the Lochgilphead football team and an aspiring doctor. Born in 1896, he had just turned 18 when the Great War began. He enlisted and, when the call for new officer candidates came, he signed up, becoming a \u0026#8216temporary gentleman\u0026#8217 rising to the rank of acting captain in charge of a battery of 4.5-inch Howitzers at the Ypres front. When the war ended, he spent six months in the army occupying Germany near Bonn.Jim was a smart boy, who loved his parents, and he was especially fond of his older sister Alexandria – a very talented pianist. She is often mentioned in the Advertiser as leading musical events in Lochgilphead, and was known as \u0026#8216Miss Lala Robertson\u0026#8217. According to Jim, she went off to study piano around 1910 in London or Edinburgh, but returned to Lochgilphead by the time the Great War broke out.After the war, Jim left for America and banished all of them from his life. It is here the mystery begins: what caused Jim to turn his back on his family and keep their existence hidden, from leaving Scotland in 1921 until his death in 1995 at the age of 99?Jim had a long and happy marriage and he and his wife Ruth had four boys who have grown up without extended family and under the impression that no relations existed in Scotland, which is not true. On a visit to Lochgilphead, Morgan found cousins in Furnace.Jim did share some clues about his family, but they were not all they seemed. He said his older brother William was in the Navy during the Great War, but had become an alcoholic, fallen overboard and drowned. This was not true. William\u0026#8217s signature was on their mother\u0026#8217s death certificate, signed in Aberdeen in 1943. William clearly lived a long life after Jim left Scotland and perhaps had his own family, themselves unaware of their American relatives.Jim\u0026#8217s telling of Alexandra\u0026#8217s story is even more tragic, saying she volunteered as a nurse in the war, fell in love with a South African soldier and left for Cape Town, only to die of food poisoning six months after arriving. This too was false, as the Advertiser\u0026#8217s obituary for their father in 1926 stated he \u0026#8216is survived by three children\u0026#8217, including Alexandra. Part of the story was true, however, as the Advertiser noted in 1920 that she married Henry Beck of Cape Town, in Dorset.Why Jim wanted to make a clean break with his family to such a degree he pretended his brother and sister had died will never be known. But it is possible his brother and sister lived long lives and had large families. Jim\u0026#8217s family in the United States now amounts to three surviving children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.Jim\u0026#8217s father, William Robertson, came from a family of printers and dyers in Bonhill, Vale of Leven, and served as a schoolmaster from 1883 to 1920. He died in 1926, possibly in Kilmun, and, according to family records, was \u0026#8216buried in Dunoon\u0026#8217, but this may be another red herring from Jim.His mother, Wilhelmina, came from a farming family in Aberdeenshire. She moved to Lochgilphead in 1874 when she was 14, to live with her uncle, Alexander Cameron Robertson, the new minister of Lochgilphead Parish Church, a position he held for more than 50 years, from 1876-1933.There is one picture which could help crack part of the mystery. It shows Jim\u0026#8217s mother with two girls and appears to have been sent to him after his move to America. Part of the handwriting on the back is obscured but reads: \u0026#8216Hannan\u0026#8217s daughter, mom and myself taken last summer.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216Mom\u0026#8217 would refer to Jim\u0026#8217s mum, \u0026#8216myself\u0026#8217 the teenage girl whose age meant she could not be the daughter of Wilhelmina or the sister of Jim. Who was she and was she part of the story which caused Jim to cut himself off from his Scottish roots?If you have any information which could help solve this mystery please email the Argyllshire Advertiser editorial team at editor@argyllshireadvertiser\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"delighted scott reclaims toss title","story":"\t\tJoanne SimmsUpdated: 23/07/18, 12:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowScott Rider is once again World Caber Champion, after he had to toss for it at Inveraray Games on Tuesday.The former Commonwealth Games shot-putter and Olympic four-man bobsleigh team member won in 2013, 2014 and 2016.Judges at Winterton Park declared it was too close to call between the Englishman and Peter Bouma from Holland and it was down to a single toss of the caber each to decide the honour.The field of 10 was whittled down to a final five which also included Jamie Gunn, from Falkirk Lukasz Wenta, East Kilbride and Stuart Anderson, Lochearnhead.The event is sponsored by The George Hotel, Inveraray. Donald Clark from The George said: ‘It’s good on games’ day to see so many well-kent faces and to see new faces doing well in the games.’Once face missing from the games this year was the Duke himself he and his family are currently in India celebrating his 50th birthday.The honour of chieftain of the games was given to Rear Admiral John Weale OBE RASM, FOSNI, ACNS(SM) who heads the Royal Navy in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Amongst the guests this year was a contingent of members of the German branch of the Clan Campbell Society.More than 4,000 people attended the games the numbers held up well against other years and the visitors were rewarded with fine weather.They saw two records broken on the track this year: Jax Thoirs from Glasgow set a new open ground record for the long jump at 21 ft 7 inches and Aiden Quinn of Glasgow took the open hop, step and jump to 47ft 2½ inches.Numbers entering the solo piping contests were, like many other games, slightly down.

Six-year-old Saul Wylie has been told medics in the UK won’t treat his severe form of cerebral palsy. But \u0026pound80,000 will open the doors to pioneering treatment from the world’s top surgeon in America. Now a huge community effort is hoping to send Saul on his way to a better life. The brave twin – who was born weighing just 1lb – faces gruelling treatment and rehab which docs at home will not back. But parents Karen and Stuart have launched a ‘Steps For Saul’ campaign that they hope will put him on the plane. Karen, 39, said: “Saul has been a fighter from day one and wasn’t even supposed to be here. “We were told to terminate him in order to give his brother a better chance of survival, but that was never an option. “He then spent most of his first year in hospital because he was born so fragile. “He’s just used to things being against him.” Saul, of Tarbolton, suffers from Spastic Diplegia Cerebral Palsy, where he sits at grade four on a scale of five. At present, doctors in this country will only treat children until stage three. But surgery in St Louis, Missouri is available that could give Saul a whole new lease of life. Karen revealed: “We feel guilty appealing for so much money, but the reality is that’s what it will take for this treatment. “Saul would face two operations to take away bad nerves and lengthen his legs – and the rehab would be long and intensive. “He has regressed so much in the last couple of years, as before he used to be able to stand with the aid of his walker. “It will only get worse and more painful unless he gets the help he needs.” Saul, who is looking forward to starting life at Tarbolton Primary next month, has already been backed by more than \u0026pound25,000 of fundraising. Dad Stuart said: “We’ve been blown away by the support so far. “Saul is very well known around the village and people have been so kind and eager to help. “We have a number of events planned and we just hope we can make this a reality.” To learn more about the campaign, visit https://www.justgiving/campaigns/charity/just4children/stepsforsaulLike us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsCerebral palsyCharity"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

Thirty of the 32 Scottish local authorities have at least one Citizens Advice Scotland centre. But South Ayrshire is believed never to have had the help and rights championing service. Inverclyde is the only other area which does not have a CAB. Now a summit has been staged within Ayr County Buildings to state a case for having the service here. The steering group of councillors met on July 12 and one source said: “There is a definite anomaly here and the question should be asked why there is not a citizens advice bureau here. “I believe need has never been greater, with increasing consumer debt and other problems.” Councils have a duty to provide the advice, but South Ayrshire Council use their own staff to give it. They work out of the Wallace Tower in Ayr, but critics insist that because they are not independent, the advice cannot be of supreme impartiality. The source added: “Often people are coming in to say they cannot pay council tax or rent. “So far from being not involved, the Council is in fact the creditor. “A push is on to finally set up a proper service for the people of South Ayrshire. “There are a lot of odd things about the South Ayrshire model, not least who is informing it on a national basis. “It is a mystery why South Ayrshire Council should or can be operating an advice centre. “They are conflating advice with information.” Citizens Advice Scotland is a registered charity, helping 300,000 people a year from a total of 61 centres. It is often a place of last resort for people having difficulties in their lives, including being weighed down by debt. And the organisation also lobbies for change in government policy where it has identified hardship being caused. All local Citizens Advice Bureaux are managed by an independent board of directors and all bureaux are members of Citizen’s Advice Scotland.  A South Ayrshire Council spokesman said: “We are committed to supporting our communities  and our people, particularly those in need.  “Through our Information and Advice Hub we already provide services which deal with income maximisation, debt and money advice and consumer information.” The umbrella body Citizens Advice Scotland refused to comment.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyrAyr NewsTaxes"},{"url":null,"title":"distinguished-service-honour-for-walkerburn-academic","story":"A WALKERBURN academic has been honoured by his peers for distinguished service to education.\nDr Colin Russell retired from the chalkface five years ago.\nBut his continued input into improving education across the country was rewarded with the Distinguished Service Award by the British Educational Leadership, Management and Administration Society.\nDr Russell, who held several headships and teaching posts at schools across the Borders and Lothians, was chair of the Society from 2011 to 2013.\nAnd it was during their recent meeting at Beaumont Mansion in Windsor that Dr Russell received his award.\nHe told us: \"I am deeply honoured to have received the Distinguished Service Award.\"\nDr Russell\u0027s contribution to the British Educational Leadership, Management and Administration Society included his instrumental role in the founding of the International Congress of Educational Leadership Societies (ICELS) and the design and implementation of the Reflective Practice Award.\nLeading figures in the field spoke of his commitment and dedication during the dinner.\nEmeritus Professor Ron Glatter said: \"Dr Russell embodied the close interplay between reflective practice and research that is at the heart of BELMAS\u0026rsquos mission.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"amythyst-set-to-sparkle-in-selkirk","story":"IN case you missed Amythyst Kiah\u0027s previous two headline slots at the String Jam Club, you have the opportunity to make it third time lucky.\nDescribing herself as a Southern Gothic, alt-country blues singer/songwriter, Amythyst is one of the most incredible singers the musically-savvy County Hotel audience has ever heard.\nBased in Tennessee, her commanding stage presence is only matched by her raw and powerful vocals -

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

During this time there were three railway stations in Peebles \u0026ndash one where Tesco now stands, which was then extended to create a line to Galashiels the second in Dean Park and the third on Caledonian Road, serving travel to the west and Glasgow.\nThe rail link not only encouraged thousands of visitors, with The Hydro having its own spur, but underpinned the huge expansion of the weaving industry by providing fast, cheap links to world markets.\nUntil now there has been little recognition of the influence of the railway on the development of Peebles and, while some evidence can still be found in the Viaduct Bridge over the River Tweed and the railway tunnel connecting the bridge to the town, much has been lost.\nBut now railway enthusiasts are steaming ahead with plans to establish a museum which will house artefacts and photographs of historic trains during their journeys through Peebles.\nThe PCT is now hoping to gauge if there is an appetite amongst the people of Peebles for the museum.\nFurther investigations will have to be carried out, as it is believed the building is owned by Scottish Borders Council.\nIf the railway museum is given the green light, funding will be sought for the renovation of the old railway building. PCT chairman Lawrie Hayworth said: \u0026ldquoThis a really exciting project which can help us all have access to this important period in the town\u0026rsquos history, a period of rapid local transformation akin to the wider impact we see today with global internet access.\n\u0026ldquoThis should also boost visitor numbers to Peebles and provide economic benefit to the town.

Coloured region represents strength of ground penetrating radar reflections, with deep blue corresponding to echoes from water. (USGS Astrogeology Science Centre, Arizona State University, ESA, INA/PA)\nThe lake, similar to those beneath the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets on Earth, lies about 1.5 kilometres (0.9 miles) below the surface of a region called Planum Australe, close to the Martian south pole, and stretches out for 20 kilometres.\nWith surface temperatures as low as minus 68C, it would not exist as a liquid under normal conditions.\nBut dissolved salts of magnesium, calcium, and sodium \u0026ndash known to be present in Martian rocks \u0026ndash are thought to maintain the briny miniature sea by reducing the melting point of water to minus 74C.\nAn Italian team of scientists detected the lake while carrying out a radar survey using the Mars Express spacecraft.\nBetween 2012 and December 2015 the Planum Australe region was mapped by the Mars Advance Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (Marsis) instrument carried on the orbiter.\nRadio waves beamed down to the surface by Marsis penetrated through the ice and bounced back to the spacecraft.\nFar beneath the ice cap at Mars\u0026rsquos south pole lies a lake of liquid water\u0026mdashthe first to be found on the Red Planet: \nhttps://t.co/VBue3BcEgn\n\u0026mdash News from Science (@NewsfromScience) \nJuly 25, 2018\nAmong the 29 radar samplings, the scientists spotted a\u0026nbsp series of unusually strong reflections bearing a distinct electrical hallmark. They revealed the presence of liquid water.\nProfessor Roberto Orosei, from the University of Bologna, wrote in the journal Science: \u0026ldquoAnomalously bright subsurface reflections are evident within a well-defined 20-kilometre-wide zone.. which is surrounded by much less reflective areas.\n\u0026ldquoQuantitative analysis of the radar signals shows that this bright feature has high relative dielectric permittivity (electrical polarisation) matching that of water-bearing materials.\n\u0026ldquoWe interpret this feature as a stable body of liquid water on Mars.\nMars Express orbiting Mars with a cross section of radar echoes superimposed and tilted 90 degrees. The left-most white line is the surface radar echo, while the light bluespots highlight areas of very high reflectivity, thought to be caused by water. (ESA, INAF, Davide Coero Borga/PA)\nThe lake may exist as a layer of clear water, or possibly be mixed with soil to form a sludge.\nEither way, the discovery greatly increases the chances of extraterrestrial life existing on Mars.\nLiquid water is an essential requirement of life as we know it.\nBillions of years ago, Mars is thought to have had oceans and rivers, much like Earth. Primitive life may have evolved on the planet then, only to be snuffed out when the world lost most of its atmosphere and became an arid frozen desert.\nIf large bodies of liquid water lie beneath Martian polar ice, they could theoretically harbour living microbes to this day.\nThe high levels of salt in the water might make the environment tough but not impossible for life.\nOn Earth, one group of organisms known as \u0026ldquohalophiles thrive in highly salty conditions such as those found in the Dead Sea and Utah\u0026rsquos Great Salt Lake.\nSpeaking in a recorded interview released by Science, Prof Orosei revealed that his team spent years checking their results before being confident enough to announce the discovery.\n\u0026ldquoWe found that any other explanation for these very strong echoes was not really tenable in light of the evidence that we had available, he said. \u0026ldquoWe had to conclude that there is water on Mars today.\nThe radar data showed that the lake contained a large amount of salt, Prof Orosei added.\n\u0026ldquoThis is certainly not a very pleasant environment for life, he said.\nBut he pointed out that similar salty subglacial lakes in Antarctica had been found to support life.\n\u0026ldquoThere are single-celled organisms that survive in such an environment with a metabolism that makes use of\u0026nbsp the salt, said the professor.\nMarsis was not able to measure the depth of lake, but the scientists estimate that it must be at least one metre thick.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By John von Radowitz, Press Association Science Correspondent\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u00279eb7b6f5-1800-47aa-9e96-53c2f0c10690\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:uk,paservice:sci-tech,paservice:sci-tech:science\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Giant liquid water lake found under Martian ice\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"views-sought-on-ayton-housing-development","story":"VIEWS are being sought on a potential major housing development in Ayton.\nBerwickshire Housing Association has unveiled plans for 49 brand new homes to be built to the south of Ayton Primary School.\u0026nbsp\nThe new estate will be accessed from Summerhill Park, with a secondary access route coming off Lawfield Drive.\u0026nbsp\nA meeting with Ayton Community Council is being held on Tuesday, September 4 to present the designs to councillors, followed by a public consultation meeting during the week commencing September 17 at Ayton Primary School.\u0026nbsp\nBerwickshire Housing Association development manager Colin Young said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove owned this site for over 20 years and we\u0026rsquore delighted that it is finally moving forward and will bring much needed homes to Ayton.\n\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove carried out a master plan exercise with architects Smith Scott Mullen.

The impasse later widened to include more traditional issues of contention, such as the Irish language, LGBT rights and how to handle to legacy of the Troubles.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Aoife Moore, Andrew Woodcock and Michael McHugh, Press Association\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u00273e8720f0-6c9f-4d47-9c06-6837dc4c4c58\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:ireland,paservice:news:uk\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Dublin not meddling in UK politics \\u2013 Coveney\u0027})\n"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week 9","story":"The eyes of the world were on these 12 young footballers and their coach, trapped in a cave in Thailand.Their predicament was life-threatening, but a rescue operation was in place.To the delight of everyone and against all the odds, as I write this, all 12 young boys and their coach have been brought to safety.They have been incredibly brave as they endured darkness, cold and hunger, trapped by the threat of rising water if the rains come.The weakest is their coach as he ensured the boys had what little food was available and took nothing for himself.Sadly one of the first divers to go in lost his own life in an attempt to save them, but his skill led the way forward for the rescue plan.I hope and pray that by the time you read this, that they are all home and ready to play football again.They will never forget the courage and the ingenuity of the international team effort to save them and I’m sure the only reward their brave rescuers will want is to know the boys are well.Evidently the boys will be invited to the final of the World Cup itself, and maybe they can dream that one day they might play in this famous tournament themselves.I hope the teams in the final will include England as I wish all my English friends a truly successful end to a brilliantly played World Cup.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rapid play on stronvaars sun baked green","story":"The competition, last Sunday, was on a fast paced Stronvaar green that is enjoying the wall to wall sunshine as much as the players.The round robin qualifying sections were won by Catherine McEachran, Ryan McLachlan, Archie Johnston and Jimmy Anderson and produced semi-finals between Ryan and Jimmy and Catherine and Archie with Jimmy and Archie emerging to contest the final.This match was closely contested and produced a lot of excellent bowls before Jimmy resulted as the winner.The trophy and prizes were presented by president Duncan MacInnes and Robert MacCallum on behalf of Peninver Sands.The prize presentation from left: Catherine McEachran, Jimmy Anderson, Duncan MacInnes, Archie Johnston, Robert MacCallum and Ryan McLachlan.

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.

In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.

Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas.

Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done.

We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

Taylor Wimpey East Scotland has teamed up with Mactaggart and Mickel Homes \u0026ndash both of which are already building on the adjacent Letham Mains site, where more than 800 homes are being built \u0026ndash for the plans on Haddington\u0026rsquos south-western edge.  The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.  Joanne Casey, director of Mactaggart \u0026amp Mickel Homes, speaking on behalf of both developers, said the PAN allowed the developers to \u0026ldquobegin the important process of community engagement.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe are fully committed to a detailed programme of engagement with local communities throughout the lifetime of our developments.  \u0026ldquoFor large-scale development projects like this one at Letham Holdings, we are especially keen to fully engage as early as possible in the overall process to allow us to understand and consider the views from as many stakeholders as we can.  \u0026ldquoWe will hold a joint public consultation event during the next few months and we would like to take this opportunity to encourage all interested individuals to become involved.  \u0026ldquoThis event will allow the local community to share their views so that we may consider these as we develop our emerging development proposal in order to make a detailed planning application around October this year."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064331.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"east-lothians-chief-nurse-takes-on-health-director-role","story":"  Alison Macdonald has been appointed to replace David Small, who left the post last month to take up a new role as director of primary care transition with NHS Lothian.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

The discovery, which has major implications for the chances of life surviving on the Red Planet, was made by an orbiting European probe using ground-penetrating radar.  It is the first time a large stable body of liquid water has been confirmed to exist on Mars.  The lake, similar to those beneath the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets on Earth, lies about 1.5 kilometres (0.9 miles) below the surface of a region called Planum Australe, close to the Martian south pole, and stretches out for 20 kilometres.  With surface temperatures as low as minus 68C, it would not exist as a liquid under normal conditions.  But dissolved salts of magnesium, calcium, and sodium \u0026ndash known to be present in Martian rocks \u0026ndash are thought to maintain the briny miniature sea by reducing the melting point of water to minus 74C.  An Italian team of scientists detected the lake while carrying out a radar survey using the Mars Express spacecraft.  Between 2012 and December 2015 the Planum Australe region was mapped by the Mars Advance Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (Marsis) instrument carried on the orbiter.  Radio waves beamed down to the surface by Marsis penetrated through the ice and bounced back to the spacecraft.          Far beneath the ice cap at Mars\u0026rsquos south pole lies a lake of liquid water\u0026mdashthe first to be found on the Red Planet: https://t.co/VBue3BcEgn          \u0026mdash News from Science (@NewsfromScience) July 25, 2018  Among the 29 radar samplings, the scientists spotted a\u0026nbsp series of unusually strong reflections bearing a distinct electrical hallmark. They revealed the presence of liquid water.  Professor Roberto Orosei, from the University of Bologna, wrote in the journal Science: \u0026ldquoAnomalously bright subsurface reflections are evident within a well-defined 20-kilometre-wide zone.. which is surrounded by much less reflective areas.  \u0026ldquoQuantitative analysis of the radar signals shows that this bright feature has high relative dielectric permittivity (electrical polarisation) matching that of water-bearing materials.  \u0026ldquoWe interpret this feature as a stable body of liquid water on Mars.  The lake may exist as a layer of clear water, or possibly be mixed with soil to form a sludge.  Either way, the discovery greatly increases the chances of extraterrestrial life existing on Mars.  Liquid water is an essential requirement of life as we know it.  Billions of years ago, Mars is thought to have had oceans and rivers, much like Earth. Primitive life may have evolved on the planet then, only to be snuffed out when the world lost most of its atmosphere and became an arid frozen desert.  If large bodies of liquid water lie beneath Martian polar ice, they could theoretically harbour living microbes to this day.  The high levels of salt in the water might make the environment tough but not impossible for life.  On Earth, one group of organisms known as \u0026ldquohalophiles thrive in highly salty conditions such as those found in the Dead Sea and Utah\u0026rsquos Great Salt Lake.  Speaking in a recorded interview released by Science, Prof Orosei revealed that his team spent years checking their results before being confident enough to announce the discovery.  \u0026ldquoWe found that any other explanation for these very strong echoes was not really tenable in light of the evidence that we had available, he said. \u0026ldquoWe had to conclude that there is water on Mars today.  The radar data showed that the lake contained a large amount of salt, Prof Orosei added.  \u0026ldquoThis is certainly not a very pleasant environment for life, he said.  But he pointed out that similar salty subglacial lakes in Antarctica had been found to support life.  \u0026ldquoThere are single-celled organisms that survive in such an environment with a metabolism that makes use of\u0026nbsp the salt, said the professor.  Marsis was not able to measure the depth of lake, but the scientists estimate that it must be at least one metre thick."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8120157.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dublin-not-meddling-in-uk-politics-coveney","story":"  Irish Foreign Affairs minister Simon Coveney, along with Justice minister Charlie Flanagan, said the talks with Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and Cabinet Office minister David Lidington did not touch on devolved issues in Northern Ireland, and instead discussed initiatives to get the Northern Ireland Assembly up and running.  \u0026ldquoUnionists in Northern Ireland have nothing to fear from a British Irish Intergovernmental Conference.

Chancellor Phillip Hammond, who was visiting Belfast on Wednesday, echoed Mr Coveney\u0026rsquos stance saying it was important that the Good Friday Agreement was honoured.  \u0026ldquoThe conference that\u0026rsquos going on in London is part of the standing arrangements under the Belfast Agreement.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos very important that we honour the commitments that we have made under those agreements and make sure that the working relationship continues.  \u0026ldquoEast-west relations are just as important as north-south relations and just as central a part of the Belfast Agreement, Mr Hammond added.  Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said the council respected the terms of the Belfast Agreement.  \u0026ldquoIt is consultative, not executive, in format and it is there to talk about those matters that are not devolved to the assembly and executive of Northern Ireland.  The meeting included discussions on security and prisons, he said.

Former first minister Lord Trimble had warned that the conference came close to breaching principles enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement that Dublin will have no role in internal UK politics.  Lord Trimble said the meeting is \u0026ldquoreaching the point of breaking the principle set out in the Good Friday Agreement that the Irish Government should have no role whatsoever in the internal politics of the UK.  The former Ulster Unionist Party leader told BBC Radio 4\u0026rsquos Today programme it is unacceptable for Irish ministers to be involved in discussions on the restoration of Stormont.  \u0026ldquoThere has been pressure from Dublin to try to change the character of the inter-governmental conference in a way that would not be acceptable to unionists and probably not acceptable to the British Government either, he said.  The DUP were also critical of the conference, claiming the people of Northern Ireland want direct action, not further talks.  DUP East Antrim MLA Gordon Lyons said: \u0026ldquoArlene Foster rightly labelled the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference \u0026lsquoa talking shop\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoIt is not a structure where decisions can be made about our roads, hospitals, schools or economy.  \u0026ldquoFor Sinn Fein, it is a smokescreen to distract from the fact that they stand isolated in boycotting the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive and the House of Commons.

The Conference, which gives the Irish a consultative role on non-devolved issues affecting Northern Ireland, last met in 2007 and its return has proved controversial.  When it was last called security was a major part of its remit, but those powers were later devolved to Stormont.  Power-sharing crashed in January 2017 after a bitter row between the DUP and Sinn Fein over a botched green energy scheme. The impasse later widened to include more traditional issues of contention, such as the Irish language, LGBT rights and how to handle to legacy of the Troubles."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7950445.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glasgow-to-swelter-in-the-sun-this-week-as-extreme-heat-sweeps-uk","story":"  Parts of Britain could see temperatures rise to 35C (95F) this week as the country remains warm in extreme hot weather that is gripping northern Europe.

Such is the demand for Scots products, the Chinese even have their own names for Highland Games, strongman kilty party, baa baa pudding, haggis and malt whisky which they cryptically call Trail Fragrant Liqueur Lane. Now as the Chinese spending power grows, wealthy tourists are being offered bespoke tours which are aimed at boosting visitor numbers, as well as selling more to China.  Chinese visitor numbers to the UK are expected to rise by almost 50% - from 260,000 to 384,000 - over the next five years, VisitBritain predicts.  Scotland currently accounts for almost one fifth (17%) of all of those coming to the UK from the country.  VisitScotland says the rise in visitors from China is expected to be driven by the young adult traveller, saying \u0026ldquomillennials are seen as a growing target market.  New figures show how important Chinese tourists are becoming to the Scottish economy. Spending by Chinese tourists increased by 414% between 2007 and 2016, from \u0026pound7 million to \u0026pound36 million.  Over the same period the number of Chinese visitors to Scotland increased by 192% 41,000 visits were recorded in 2016.  Pernod Ricard is targeting the country\u0026rsquos younger generation and its expanding middle classes who have higher disposable incomes.  More than 750 Chinese tourists will land later this week for a four-day tour that will see them immerse themselves in all aspects of Scottish culture.  They will visit the most famous whisky region of Speyside where they will tour the Strathisla Distillery, the world-renowned Glenlivet Distillery which was the first licensed one in the area and then Aberlour.  The visitors will also be invited to don kilts and sashes at a Highland dinner where they will have the opportunity to taste some of the best Scotland has to offer. Other excursions will include a trip to Loch Ness to try to spot the famous monster and no trip to Scotland would be complete without a visit to a football match and the group will take part in a tournament at Inverness Caledonian Thistle\u0026rsquos stadium.  The trip is part of a drive to improve sales in the vast Communist state with the country representing more than half of the global whisky trade with 25 bottles of Scotch exported to China every minute.  Neil MacDonald, Brand Experience Director, Chivas Brothers, said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to be able to host our colleagues from China and show them all the wonderful sights and industries we have to offer here in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoVisiting the birthplace of our brands and becoming immersed in their craftsmanship and heritage really is the best way to understand what makes each of them unique.  \u0026ldquoThe experiences that our Chinese colleagues have in Scotland, the people they meet, the Scottish celebrations and being at our distilleries will fuel their personal story-telling to colleagues, consumers and trade back in China.  \u0026ldquoThis creates even stronger opportunities for our brands and Scotch whisky as a whole.  \u0026ldquoChina is a very important market for us, and we expect its significance will only continue to grow over the coming years.  \u0026ldquoBy fostering even stronger ties with our colleagues, we\u0026rsquore confident this trip will help us build on our solid partnership for the future.  It comes as the number of visitors travelling to the UK from China is expected to soar from fewer than 500 in 1996 to almost 500,000 by 2026, a report from VisitBritain states.  Chinese tourists spent more than \u0026pound513 million in the UK last year, but the figure is set to rise sharply.  Visits abroad have more than doubled in five years, from about 41 million overnight stays in 2011 to 85 million by 2016. By 2020 it is forecast to exceed 110 million trips overseas, In Scotland, visitor numbers have been boosted by the popularity of whisky, which has resulted in a surge of visits to distilleries.  The number of visitors to Scotland\u0026rsquos distilleries reached an all-time high of 1.7 million in 2016, an increase of 8% on the previous year, and the Scotch Whisky Association recognises the Chinese influx played a part in this increase.  Research shows the average age of Chinese visitors to the UK is younger than the average age of inbound travellers.  In 2016, half of Chinese visitors were aged 25-44 and it is estimated that 60% were aged 18 to 34.  Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness are known to be the favourite locations in Scotland for Chinese travellers to visit.  A growing number of Chinese have an estimated \u0026pound20million or more in liquid financial assets who are below the age of 30.  Whisky sales in China leapt in 2017 with imports of 17.4 million litres, representing a year-on-year growth of 19.5%.  Whisky is the third most popular alcoholic drink among Chinese people, with consumption growing more than 83% over the past five years."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/2275658.jpg?type=article-full","title":"estate-agents-latest-casualties-on-the-high-street","story":"  But just as those businesses have slowly retreated from formerly vibrant town centres, it now appears that estate agents are following suit.  New research has found that failures among property businesses are on the rise in the UK, with more than 50 going bust each year in Scotland since 2013.  Across the border the situation is even worse, with 2,446 estate agents in England and Wales closing their doors during the same time frame as they come under pressure from rising costs and competition from the internet, according to research by property management firm DJ Alexander.  And it may be that office-based estate agents are going for good, with researchers finding \"generational\" shift in the way people look for property.    David Alexander, managing director of DJ Alexander Ltd, explained: \"For most people under 40-years-old, the idea of wandering from shop to shop in city centres\u0026rsquo is alien to them and they conduct many of their purchases on their phones, tablets, or computers.  \"This situation is only likely to continue, and we can see that High Street outlets such as estate agents are suffering as a result and will continue to suffer over the next few years.  \"Online competition has had a dramatic impact on the High Street with its lower cost base and its generational and cultural shift from on street to online shopping.  \"The internet has undercut much of the High Street in the retail and other sectors over the last five years and this is likely to continue.  The research covers a period when exclusively online estate agents such as Purple Bricks became established, proving that the model does work.    By cutting out bricks-and-mortar premises and handling everything electronically, firms such have these have been able to cut costs while serving clients needs, Mr Alexander said.  He added: \"The loss of the High Street estate agent does not mean less service, in fact it means more, with a greater focus on the needs of the client.  \"The online client is simply using a different method of accessing the housing market, but their demands remain as high, if not higher, than before.  \"But the market remains buoyant for those offering clients an up to date online service fully catering for all their needs from initial advice, consulting, managing, advertising, and promoting with their key legal and financial needs met.  \"It is a brave new world but one in which estate agency will continue to exist but not in the way it has in the past and these failures are a sign that there will be closures along the way as the market adjusts.  Gavin Mochan, Sales Director for s1Homes, said that the rise of online estate agents had gathered pace in recent years.  He said: \"Initially, when online portals came to pass the pure online agent seemed inconceivable given some of the key ingredients were missing.  \"A great example of a missing fundamental was data. Back then finding out how much your house was worth was reliant on the local knowledge of your estate agent and the process was purely physical.  \"These days portals such as s1homes can tell you the purchase price of every house in the street giving you very credible estimates.\"  However, he said that the estate agents who are doing best are those who have developed a hybrid approach using both an online and a physical presence.  Andrew Perratt, Head of Residential Property at Savills in Scotland agrees, saying that even with their wide-reaching work on the web, there is little substitute for a face-to-face meeting.    He said: \"Savills is currently seeing the strongest market in Scotland for a decade and having a powerful website with global reach is more important than ever.  \"That said, it is ultimately about listening to our clients and our research tells us that they continue to want the convenience of their agent on the high street.  \"The most successful agents are combining the benefits of powerful online marketing with a first class personalised service from people they can actually meet face to face.  He added: \"You can\u0026rsquot do that by hiding behind a pc. As long as consumers want the convenience of speaking to a local agent with in depth local market knowledge, we\u0026rsquoll continue to offer a branch network which puts our agents at the heart of their local communities.\"  Malcolm Leslie, Head of Residential Agency for Strutt \u0026amp Parker in Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThere is no doubt that businesses across every sector need to adapt to a changing marketplace and find ways of responding to new challenges.  \"The residential property sector has recently been going through a visible period of disruption and change, with the \u0026lsquoonline\u0026rsquo agency models reaching the headlines, and \u0026lsquoproptech\u0026rsquo companies appearing at a rapid pace.  \"To ensure we stay in touch with our clients\u0026rsquo needs and expectations, we are responding and adapting to those challenges through the use of that technology.\"  He added:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe think there is a place in the future \u0026nbspfor both online\u0026nbspagents and traditional agents.  \"There will be sellers who choose to market their properties online, which realistically allows vendors to sell their home themselves, and those who are willing to pay for a complete service, with the additional hope that having a dedicated expert will result in a better sale and higher price."},{"url":null,"title":"questions-piling-up-over-scots-tory-donations-says-snps-pete-wishart-as-david-mundell-insists-rules-followed-assiduously","story":"  The escalating row centres on the role of the Scottish Unionist Association Trust[SUAT], which has given the Tories in Scotland nearly \u0026pound320,000, and which is now being examined by the Electoral Commission, the elections watchdog, to see whether or not it is a permissible donor. Critics have branded SUAT donations \u0026ldquodark money.  The SNP\u0026rsquos Pete Wishart has written to the commission to enquire about the extent of the SUAT\u0026rsquos property portfolio, which, he suggested, could disbar it from being a permissible donor.  The backbench MP has called on Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, to reveal if any of the SUAT donations were used in the 2017 General Election campaigns of Tory MPs John Lamont, David Duguid and Douglas Ross, all of whom took seats from sitting Nationalist candidates last year.  Asked on the BBC\u0026rsquos Good Morning Scotland programme if SUAT cash was used to fight seats in the General Election, Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Conservatives have registered and appropriately declared and set out all the funding they have received from the SUAT and all other sources of funding.  The Scottish Secretary made clear he had not personally received cash from the SUAT and stressed that he was confident that all money received during his time in politics had been \u0026ldquoappropriately declared and that the Scottish Conservatives had followed the rules \"assiduously\" if anyone had evidence to the contrary, they should take it to the commission, he added.  But Mr Wishart insisted Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos responses had failed to provide a satisfactory explanation over whether or not the Scottish Tories had \u0026ldquoused dark money in last year\u0026rsquos General Election to bankroll campaigns in key target seats.  The Perth MP went on: \"Transparency over party financing is absolutely essential in any healthy democracy the public need to have a clear understanding of who helped put their elected representatives into office.  \"As each day passes, more and more questions are piling up for the Scottish Tories it is time for Ruth Davidson to break her silence and answer the questions that her colleagues are refusing to answer.  \"Was dark money used in last year\u0026rsquos election campaign? And if it was, are the Tories satisfied that the election expense returns of John Lamont, David Duguid and Douglas Ross were correctly completed? And have David Mundell\u0026rsquos own election campaigns received money that originated from SUAT over the years?\"  He added: \"The Electoral Commission needs to use its powers to crack down on rule-breaking, cheating and dark money. Political campaigns have to be a level playing field to protect democracy that is why this investigation is so serious and so urgently needed.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-mp-criticised-for-defending-partys-role-in-bringing-thatcher-to-power","story":"  Tommy Sheppard, the SNP\u0026rsquos Cabinet Office spokesman, told a Westminster debate: \u0026ldquoIn retrospect, I would have done exactly the same thing.

Party insiders are keen to draw a line under the controversy for fear it might drag on and overshadow Labour\u0026rsquos autumn conference in September.  Ms Griffith told the BBC: \u0026ldquoThe idea that Jeremy would want to set up an atmosphere in the party where people couldn\u0026rsquot go and say things to him is completely absurd.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos just not his way of dealing things. We\u0026rsquod all prefer to have somebody speak to your face rather than behind your back. It\u0026rsquos important that we have those discussions and if it means we need to do a lot more work to get things right let\u0026rsquos do it.  The Llanelli MP said at the moment she was not aware of any processes \u0026ldquoby which, because somebody speaks to somebody else \u0026lsquoin a particular way\u0026rsquo we\u0026rsquove had disciplinary procedures. Normally if we\u0026rsquore speaking about policy, if we\u0026rsquore talking about issues, we can have those discussions.  She added: \"I just can\u0026rsquot see a situation where we discipline people for speaking their minds to each other, whether its members of the Shadow Cabinet or the Leader of the Opposition himself.\"  Mr McDonnell blamed Dame Margaret\u0026rsquos \"haranguing\" of the party leader on her \"complete misunderstanding\" of the party\u0027s new code of conduct on anti-Semitism, which has been widely criticised within the Jewish community.  Dame Margaret - who is Jewish and lost relatives in the Holocaust - has said she stands by her comments, though she denies swearing at Mr Corbyn in an angry confrontation in a Commons corridor last week.  Jennie Formby, Labour\u0026rsquos General Secretary, has written to the backbencher, telling her she faced investigation for \"abusive conduct\" and that \"any further behaviour of a similar nature\" could result in disciplinary action.  Mr McDonnell pointed out how Dame Margaret\u0027s outburst was \"out of character\" and she was \"extremely angry and lost her cool\" when she confronted Mr Corbyn.  \"Of course, he was upset Margaret was upset as well,\" he explained. \u0026ldquoJeremy was deeply upset because, when you have someone haranguing you in that way, of course it\u0027s upsetting. Those sorts of accusations, when he has worked so hard on the issues of anti-Semitism and anti-racism, of course he\u0027s upset.\"  The Shadow Chancellor said later interviews had shown Dame Margaret\u0027s concern had been based on a misunderstanding of the code agreed by Labour\u0027s ruling National Executive Committee.  \"I realised there was a complete misinterpretation of the code, so I can understand why she was so angry if that\u0027s what she believed this code had done. It\u0027s a complete misunderstanding and we can resolve this amicably and move on.\"  Mr McDonnell said Mr Corbyn agreed that the case should be settled swiftly rather than subjected to the full disciplinary process.  \"At the weekend I spoke to Jeremy and said we\u0027ve got to resolve this matter quickly,\" explained the London MP. \"He said, yes, we\u0027ve got to do that, and he\u0027s asked the Chief Whip and General Secretary to try to sort this out. We want it resolved amicably and that can be done.\"  He stressed that neither he nor Mr Corbyn could get involved in the disciplinary process overseen by Ms Formby and Nick Brown, the Chief Whip.  And he said he did not know who had initially reported Dame Margaret\u0027s behaviour, saying only that \"a range of complaints came in\".  On Monday, Labour MPs agreed to stage a vote in September on whether to accept the new code, which has come under fire because its list of anti-Semitic behaviours omits a number of examples included by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.  The party insists that the examples, mostly relating to criticism of the state of Israel, are dealt with elsewhere in the document.  Mr McDonnell said it would be \"mistaken\" to think that Mr Corbyn\u0027s long association with pro-Palestinian campaigns should raise questions about his commitment to fighting anti-Semitism.  After initially stumbling over his words and describing Labour as \"a party that is anti-racist and anti-Semitist\", he told the BBC\u0026rsquos Today programme: \"We are against anti-Semitism, we are a party that attacks anti-Semitism wherever it is, either in our party or in our community.  \"We are going to tackle this and we will lead that campaign to ensure that Jewish people are respected and feel safe within our community.  \"Jeremy is as committed to that as anyone else within our party and anyone else within our community,\" he added."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8118515.jpg?type=article-full","title":"diver-finds-britains-largest-gold-nugget-in-scotland","story":"  A treasure hunter has uncovered the largest nugget ever discovered in Britain while diving in a Scottish river.

Experts say it is 500 years since a similar nugget has been found in Britain - although there may be more where this one came from.  However, the location of the river is being kept under wraps to prevent a disorderly gold rush.    The man, who has been hunting for gold as a hobby for 20 years, said: \u0026ldquoI was following a crack in the bedrock and found around 2g in fine gold.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThis then led to a pocket, where I uncovered the nugget.

Historically, it is off the Richter scale.  Mr Kirk hopes it will end up being purchased by a British museum, although legally it may have to be handed over to The Crown Estate.\u0026nbsp    The nugget was found using a technique known as \u0027sniping\u0027  Dr Neil Clark, author of Scottish Gold: Fruit Of The Nation and curator at The Hunterian, University of Glasgow, believes the shape of the Douglas Nugget could mean there is more gold just waiting to be found close to the mystery location.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to say whether this nugget broke from a larger chunk or not.\u0026nbsp  \u0026ldquoThe rounded edges of the piece indicate that it has certainly been in the watercourse for a while.  \u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThe size of the nugget suggests that it probably did not travel far, though.  But he added: \u0026ldquoThe fact that we have waited over 500 years for this nugget suggests it may be difficult to find another comparable one in the near future.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 5:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

As a result, Newton Road will be closed from July 19 at 7am to July 22 at 11am.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known. He is an example to us all.\"Mike is a great colleague but more importantly a great friend to all of us in the Highlands.\"Since their launch of the Utility Week Stars Awards in 2014, the annual event has grown to become the de facto celebration of dedication, ingenuity and teamwork in the UK utilities sector.SSEN picked up another gong, as the SSEN Safety, Health and Environment team won the Health and Safety Initiative award for the roll-out of an influencing behaviours training programme and safety licence across the division.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 5:44 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaWednesday 25 Jul 2018 5:44 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The utility giant said underlying earnings at its generation and supply unit had soared by more than 300 per cent to £165.8 million in the six months to the end of June. It added that the  division had “recovered” from a poor performance in 2017.            Average customer consumption increased by 4 per cent year-on-year over the period, which was mainly due to cold weather from the Beast from the East around late February and March.            Customer numbers now stand at about 4.9 million, down from the five million reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.The latest figures come after the Big Six energy company, which is owned by Spanish multinational Iberdrola, increased prices in a move that hit some 950,000 households.The firm hiked its standard variable gas and electricity prices for around a third of its customers from 1 June, with impacted households facing an average increase of 5.5 per cent.ScottishPower attributed the rise to an increase in wholesale energy costs, alongside costs associated with upgrading meters and delivering electricity from low-carbon sources.The firm has been investing in wind power, having completed a £650m project to build eight wind farms north of the Border.            Over the first six months of 2018, ScottishPower also started construction on a major offshore wind farm in East Anglia, the East Anglia ONE project.Underlying earnings at the ScottishPower Renewables business rose 27 per cent to £205.1m while they nudged up 3 per cent to £399.9m at the SP Energy Networks division.The group has also completed the installation of one million smart meters. It is working with four installation partners across the UK, installing at peak 2,700 meters per day with a UK-wide workforce of more than 500 people.ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: “Everyone knows that installing smart meters hasn’t been plain sailing for suppliers. Challenges have been overcome, with more to face, but it is a major achievement to reach one million installations.            “The potential for customers to reduce consumption and save money is only one benefit. As the energy industry becomes fully digital in the years ahead, the new meters will be a vital cog in a smart network that supports electric vehicle charging, manages locally produced renewable energy and even the storage of electricity at home.”On the half-year results he noted: “All of our business areas are performing in line with expectations. Our investment in onshore wind last year has seen an increase in electricity generated, and excellent progress has been made on delivering the £2.5 billion East Anglia ONE project.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773882.1532533083!/image/image.jpg","title":"scots castle behind name of canadian city up for sale","story":"        IT is believed to have inspired the name of the Canadian city of Calgary after a Mountie was hosted as a guest almost 150 years ago.                Now Calgary Castle on the isle of Mull has been put up for sale for offers over £695,000.            The detached house, which earned the nickname of “castle” due to its gothic windows and angled turrets, is credited with its moniker being copied in the western Canadian city after Colonel James MacLeod of the Canadian North West Mounted Police stayed at the house in 1876.            After staying at the castle – and apocryphally falling for the daughter of the house - Colonel MacLeod, who had emigrated to Canada with his family from Scotland thirty years earlier, returned home and changed the name of Fort Brisebois in Alberta to Fort Calgary. The then tiny outpost grew into the city of Calgary, which in Gaelic is called ‘Cala Ghearraidh’ and translates to ‘beach of the meadow’.It is also understood that the castle, which boasts author John Buchan among its notable guests, was later owned by Major Philip Profumo – the brother of John Profumo, centre of the 1963 sex and espionage scandal that rocked the British establishment. The Profumo affair, which saw cabinet minister John Profumo embroiled in a brief relationship with Christine Keeler, a 19-year-old would-be model, resulted in the resignation of Profumo and soon afterwards, then end of Harold Macmillan’s time as Prime Minister.The eight-bedroom castle, which additionally offers a self-contained two-bedroom apartment, boasts views over Calgary Bay and across to Coll and Tiree and lies 12 miles from Tobermory.Built in the 1700s, it was extended in the early 1800’s by Alan MacAskill, a successful merchant navy captain and also includes decorative plasterwork added during Profumo’s tenure and a dumb waiter from the dining room to the former staff quarters on the lower ground floor.The 27.9 acre grounds are a haven for wildlife – golden eagles have been spotted on the lawn – and Mull itself offers abundant opportunities to see golden eagles, sea eagles, basking sharks, minke whales and dolphins.            Malcolm Leslie, head of residential agency for Strutt \u0026amp Parker in Scotland, said: “Calgary Castle is a wonderful, secluded property, steeped in history. It would make an idyllic home and while it offers the romanticism of island life, its proximity to Tobermory makes it a practical option too.”It is believed that the property will require extensive renovations by the new owner.Denis Broad, chairman of the Mull Museum in Tobermory, said: “Calgary in Canada was certainly named after Calgary on Mull. James MacLeod was connected in some way to the Mackenzie family from Calgary and I believe he stayed at the house. It is well known on the island, it lies behind Calgary itself, behind the beach.”He added: “We don’t really have any specific connections with Canada these days.”            Calgary in Canada, which lies about 50 miles east of the Canadian mountain range the Rockies, is Canada’s third largest city, with a population of 1.3 million people. It is also said to have the highest number of millionaires per capita of any major city in Canada. The indigenous peoples of Southern Alberta referred to the Calgary area as “elbow”, in reference to the sharp bend made by the Bow River and the Elbow River."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773314.1532458728!/image/image.jpg","title":"ayesha hazarika on brexit tories tell lies and corbyn sells unicorns","story":"        The Tories are telling lies while Corbyn has a bridge with unicorns to sell you, writes Ayesha Hazarika                Westminster is smoking hot. And not in a good way. This kind of heatwave is no laughing matter. Having been brought up in Glasgow, I am not equipped to deal with this.             I know my parents are Indian, but they came here to escape this kind of godawful evil weather. Cats and dogs are begging to be shaved it’s so bad. And the heat has clearly affected British politics because it has gone into meltdown.            MPs head off for their summer break this week and some of us would normally say it was “well deserved”, but they haven’t covered themselves in glory and leave behind what can be only be described as a genuine political crisis.Brexit has trapped us in a what Danny Dyer brilliantly described as a mad political riddle where the business of running the country has effectively ground to the halt. Although to be fair that hasn’t just happened this parliamentary term. Government ministers, advisers and the civil service haven’t had the bandwidth to focus on the rather difficult day job of running the country since David Cameron called the EU referendum because the toxic politics of the campaign took over. Ironically for a campaign which was dominated by the slogan “take back control”, domestic British politics has spun out of control. We have huge problems the length and breadth of these shores which need the best brains, focus, hard-work, determination and good faith – from funding gaps in the NHS to the lack of opportunities for young people to housing and infrastructure – and sadly our most of our leading politicians seem to be woefully lacking all these qualities.The Conservatives are the equivalent of a circular firing squad and are so busy fighting over Brexit and jostling for who will succeed Theresa May, who will be out the door faster than you can say “strong and stable” once some deal is done on Brexit – although, her words “no deal is better than a bad deal” are proving to be rather prophetic. READ MORE: David Mundell: There’s no alternative to the Brexit White Paper            A ‘no deal’ and crashing out of the EU on WTO terms is now a growing prospect. If this happens, it won’t be because the EU won’t accept a deal, it will be because hard-right Tory Brexiteers won’t. After Chequers, she sent Ministers out on the airwaves to say that this was the absolute, final Cabinet position, then the very next day she gave in to Jacob Rees-Mogg. With this kind of the steel, I bet the EU are sh****** themselves. She then conceded that she would have to probably give way to the EU on further areas, which is true but how do you think the hard-right in her party are going to take those concessions? They are emboldened, and they will not give way. They never have. Ever since the days of John Major, who was out over the weekend calling for a second referendum.I am much more sympathetic to this notion now, but it won’t magic away all the problems – it would simply unblock the Brexit impasse we have in Parliament. What would the question or indeed questions be? How many options would have you have? Would you even include the option to overturn the decision and remain in the EU or would that be seen as undemocratic and unfair? And remainers like me might get a nasty shock – a second referendum may deliver an even bigger margin for leave because, if people hated Westminster in the run-up to the referendum, you can bet your bottom dollar they would want to give it an even bigger two-fingers after two years of arsing around.But it may be the only option if politics can’t find a way though. To give you an idea of how messed up the Government’s Brexit plans are, yesterday it was announced that the Brexit Department will no longer be negotiating Brexit. You literally could not make this stuff up.READ MORE: Food safety controls under threat from no-deal Brexit            Speaking of which, a special mention must go to Vince Cable, leader of the Lib Dems who last week managed to miss a critical vote on Brexit because he was allegedly at a dinner discussing setting up a new party to stop Brexit. Former leader Tim Farron also missed this important vote because he was busy making a speech about homosexuality and the church. It’s great to see the political titan whose only contributions to the last general election was the phrase “smell my spaniel” and a massive row about gay sex is back out there on his “it’s a sin” tour.But things took a more sinister twist when the deputy leader of the Lib Dems, Jo Swinson, was swindled out of her vote at a knife-edge moment because the Tories basically lied to her. She has just had a baby and is still on maternity leave. Julian Smith, the Tory Chief Whip, promised she would be “paired” with MP Brandon Lewis during a crucial Brexit vote. This is an arrangement where if an MP is sick or they can’t be in parliament for an important vote, their “pair” from the opposing party agrees not to vote so that they cancel each other out. It’s based on trust and honour ... Lewis then broke that promise and voted. This is outrageous. The Tories are saying this was an innocent mistake. Do me a favour. We weren’t born yesterday like Swinson’s baby! Lewis and Smith clearly lied, and should be sacked. It’s polite to give up your seat for a pregnant woman – they should be made to give up theirs. Permanently. What a low moment for politics.And don’t look to Labour for any comfort on Brexit. Yesterday Corbyn showed his true Eurosceptic heart by making a speech where he tried to sell us the economic “benefits” of Brexit, which got praised to the rafters by the Leave campaign. He also has a massive bridge to sell you, with a unicorn waiting for each and every one of you on the other side. So, the chances of Labour blocking Brexit or backing a second referendum or a ‘people’s vote’ are pretty slim. Mind you. They have bigger fish to fry right now. Like picking the mother of all rows with the Jewish community over anti-semitism and trying to make communism fashionable again.I really do despair. Never have we needed better politics.

I have long considered myself an avid radio listener. It is a habit ingrained by weekend afternoons in my grandfather’s kitchen, where after a daunder back from the bookies, we would gather round the wireless and listen intently to proceedings from Ascot or Newmarket, where the rising pitch of the commentators vied for attention with the rush of hooves and the desperate, hopeful shouts of the crowd.            I should probably count myself lucky that I never developed an affinity for the gee-gees as a consequence, but I will always be grateful for that early introduction to a medium that felt more immediate than television ever could.            Growing up with one foot in the analogue age, I kept the flame burning, and with the advent of the internet and the proliferation of digital radio stations, my habit became hopelessly and permanently entrenched. I have lost count of sleepless hours given over to Ira Glass and John Hockenberry on National Public Radio’s Talk of the Nation, discussing obscure issues in a distant country in a way that felt relevant and intimate.Glass, of course, went on to create This American Life, a radio show which morphed into one of the world’s most popular podcasts. Even today, each episode is downloaded by around 2.5 million people. If that particular show’s success is well established, it would appear the popularity of its medium has yet to peak. The latest analysis by Rajar, the official body in charge of measuring radio audiences in the UK, shows that as of this spring, some six million adults across Britain listened to at least one podcast a week.That number might appear relatively small – just 11 per cent of the population – but when you assess it the proper context, its scale – and growth – is really quite something. Only last year, the number stood at just 4.7 million, and the number of people now downloading podcasts now outstrips the reach of BBC Radio 5 Live. READ MORE: From football to knitting: the rise of the Scottish podcast            Such statistics have led to 2018 being hailed by the BBC as the year of the “podcast boom”. Such a bold prophecy may be intended as self-fulfilling, at least on the BBC’s part. In March, the corporation announced the appointment of its first-ever podcast commissioner, Jason Phipps, and it clearly believes it can build on the 240 million annual downloads of its programmes. It, along with other broadcasters and media companies, faces a stern challenge in attracting a younger demographic who do not consume their media via linear channels, and podcasting is one the most obvious areas to focus on. Recent research by Acast, one of the main competitors to iTunes as the world’s leading podcast platform, found that two thirds of listeners are aged between 16 and 34. What is more, nearly a fifth of them have only started listening in the past six months. The success of the BBC’s evolving podcasting operation alone will not solve that problem, but it is a start.            It is hard, however, to see the projected ‘boom’ coming to pass. Podcasting is hardly a new, emerging medium. In one form or another, it has been a staple of our media diet for well over a decade. iTunes first started collating a directory of podcasts as far back as 2005, when the term was named as the Merriam Webster dictionary’s word of the year. Within the space of 12 months, the comedian, Ricky Gervais, helped propel the medium into the public consciousness, with millions of users downloading his comedy shows.  For a good few years, the podcast charts were dominated by such high-profile figures looking to emulate Gervais’s success. And while the podcasting world is still inhabited by any number of celebrities, its greatest treasures are to be found elsewhere. READ MORE: Podcast tells gory tale of Scottish crime writer’s lifeIn the past few days, I have listened to a 50-minute documentary about the economics of US dentistry, an hour-long interview with Kenney Jones, the former drummer with the Small Faces, and a two hour-long show devoted entirely to the 1978 arcade game, Space Invaders.Slowly but surely, such esoteric listening choices have displaced live radio as my audio go-to. I subscribe to more than 70 different shows, and on an average week, I will listen to around 12 hours of programming. Over the past year, the lion’s share of this has consisted of podcasts which focus on US politics, such as FiveThirtyEight, Pod Save America, Trumpcast, Trump Inc, all of which provide incisive takes on the Trump administration.            But so too, my podcast diet is supplemented by an ever-widening spectrum of programmes that embrace niche subjects. On the one hand, it includes the likes of Trade Talks, a weekly insight into international trade deals, and The Tip Off, which interviews leading journalists about how they came across some of their biggest stories. On the other hand, it takes in Wrestle Me, where comedians Marc Haynes and Pete Donaldson revisit every WrestleMania event from 1985 onwards in chronological order, and Cult of Geshcast, in which two Glaswegian friends, Gavin Spence and Phillip Maddison, discuss various cults and sects through the ages. These are my niche interests, but whatever you are interested in, or even curious about, chances are there is a podcast out there for you. There might not be a boom in 2018, but with the bewildering choice of programmes out there, it’s hard to see how podcasts will fail to become an increasingly prominent part of our media landscape."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773720.1532526154!/image/image.jpg","title":"scottish mps brand royal navy frigate delay utterly shocking","story":"        Five new Royal Navy frigates expected to begin operation in 2023 risk being delayed after the Ministry of Defence admitted it had received no viable bids to build them.

If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nWednesday 25 Jul 2018 5:44 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_0946-e1530785665580.jpg","title":"harold davis 1933 2018 from the korean front line to footballing glory and a spot of fishing in wester","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nHis surname should in fact better reflect the Wester Ross area he’s called home for almost 40 years.\n“I like that to be known up here in MacKenzie country,” he notes from his home near Badachro, on the shores of Gairloch. “My mother was Catherine MacQueen Kirk, and my father was Angus Davis, though originally he was born Angus MacKenzie. The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advert_whfp.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

So too should the Irishlanguage, Gaelic culture and Irish identity.\nThe Good Friday Agreement was not about winners and losers.\nThe principles of mutual respect, parity of esteem and equality belong to allsides.\nThe politics of fear and division must be rejected.\nWe need a real and meaningful discussion about how we can share a vision forthe future and build towards reconciliation.\nA good start would be to start a genuine dialogue between Sinn Féin and OrangeOrder.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27418  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“Tonight’s rally is an opportunity for the people of Belfast to come out to show solidarity with the families of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey and the people of the Bogside in Derry and send a message to those involved in attacks on Republicans and on the community to stop immediately. - Pat Sheehan\nA solidarity rally will be held in Belfast this evening following the attacks on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey. \nThe rally will take place at the site of the former Andersonstown barracks and will be addressed by Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald. \nGerry Adams and Bobby Storey are also expected to attend tonight\u0027s demonstration. \nThe homes of both men were attacked in the early hours of Saturday morning when explosive devices were thrown. \nCCTV footage from the scene of the attack on Gerry Adams\u0027 home shows that a device was thrown from a passing car. \nAs well as to show solidarity with the two leading republicans and their families, this evening\u0027s rally has also been organised as a further show of solidarity with the people of Derry\u0027s Bogside following six nights of disturbances in the area last week. \nWest Belfast Sinn Féin MLA Pat Sheehan encouraged as many people as possible to attend tonight\u0027s demonstration in order to send a message to those behind the attacks. \n“The attacks involving explosive devices on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey were cowardly and reprehensible.\n“Those involved are opposed to the peace process and the process of change.\n“Sinn Féin will continue to represent this community and pursue our agenda for change, for peace and for a new agreed and united Ireland.\n“Tonight’s rally is an opportunity for the people of Belfast to come out to show solidarity with the families of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey and the people of the Bogside in Derry and send a message to those involved in attacks on Republicans and on the community to stop immediately,\" he said. \nThe rally will be held tonight at 7pm. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27419  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nAttacks on republican leaders, attacks on neighbours and communities, wherever they happen, are attacks on society as a whole and society understands that. - Mary Lou McDonald\nThose responsible for the bomb attacks on the homes of Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey, and the recent disturbances in Derry, have no \"plan, strategy or vision for the future,\" Sinn Féin President Mary Lou McDonald has said. \nThe Sinn Féin leader made the remarks ahead of a rally in Belfast tonight to show solidarity with Gerry Adams and Bobby Storey whose homes were attacks with explosive devices at the weekend. \nSpeaking to the media in Belfast alongside Sinn Féin vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill and West Belfast MLA Pat Sheehan, the Sinn Féin president encouraged people to attend tonight\u0027s rally in Andersonstown. \nMary Lou McDonald said Sinn Féin would not be intimidated by such attacks and added that communities will not be bullied by those intent on causing violence and disruption. \n“There is no appetite, no excuse and no purpose behind the violence that occurred,\" she said. \n\"Attacks on republican leaders, attacks on neighbours and communities, wherever they happen, are attacks on society as a whole and society understands that,\" the Dublin Central TD added. \nThe Sinn Féin President said that those intent on violence have nothing to offer society. \n“Michelle and I were in Derry on Friday, we spoke to the people in the Bogside - they made it very clear how angry they are at a very small element that has brought hardship and trouble and panic in some cases to elderly residents and I know here in Belfast there is widespread anger.\n“There is zero tolerance for any element that would set out to cause harm or to cause disruption.\n“Those intent on this disruption have no political plan, have no political strategy, have no vision for the future.

be in the frame over the summer months as a new group of friends get out and about together as part of an exciting new walking and photography group. \n  \nDoury Road Youth Group and Alzheimer’s Society are just two of the 30 groups which have been partnered in the ‘Peacing Ages Together’ PEACE IV project.\n  \nThe project has been supported through the European Union’s PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB).\n  \nThis intergenerational partnership is the first to meet out of 15 cross-community partnerships created by MEAAP, and they plan to visit local beauty spots over the summer, for walks and photography sessions.\n  \nThese will then form an arts project they will take part in together in September.\n  \nTwelve older people who live with dementia will meet up with 12 young people and spend 10 sessions together having fun and making new friends over the next few months.\n  \nMEAAP Peace IV Project Officer Sarah McLaughlin said: “This is an amazing opportunity for young people to build their awareness of dementia and take part in fun activities with older people who have so many experiences to share.\n  \n“The ‘Peacing Ages Together’ project is all about tackling loneliness and building friendships between people who may not normally get the chance to meet in everyday life. \n  \n“We have 14 more partnerships just like this one who are meeting for the first time and getting to enjoy new adventures together through 2018/2019.\n  \n“We are supporting each partnership to participate in 10 fun activity sessions ranging from circus skills workshops to cooking food from around the world. This partnership was full of ideas for their sessions and it is very exciting to watch how their relationships will develop over the 10 sessions.\n  \n“We fund all aspects of the project from facilitators to days out and this partnership will be heading up to visit the new Tropical Ravine at Botanical Gardens next month to take more photographs.”\n  \nDeputy Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Cheryl Johnston, said: “It’s great to hear from yet another of the exciting Peace IV Projects.\n  \n“Congratulations to all involved and to the Mid and East Antrim Peace IV Partnership, who have brought together delivery partners from across the borough to make a real difference in our local communities.”\n  \nValerie Guthrie, Dementia Support Worker, Alzheimer’s Society, said: “For people with dementia this is a fantastic chance to reach out to the younger generation and show them how you can live well with dementia.\n  \n“Yes, it’s a hidden illness that people don’t really understand but having the opportunity to meet with our group will help the younger people to expand their understanding about dementia and get rid of any fear or stigma they may have around Dementia”\n  \nKerry Lynn, from Doury Road Youth Group, said: “Our young people are so excited about this partnership. \n  \n“They have worked with older people before and learned so much. Now they have had their dementia-friendly training with Valerie and Lisa, and they are so eager to get out and have some fun together”\n  \nMatch-funding for this element of the PEACE IV Programme has been provided by the Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department of Rural and Community Development in Ireland.

music, performers and family entertainment to the heart of Ballymena\n  \nSummer Sounds at Broadway, an action-packed new programme of free outdoor entertainment featuring live music, performing arts and family fun, kicks off in Ballymena this Saturday (7 July).\n  \nThe exciting bill of activities will take place in the heart of Ballymena every weekend and is organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council in conjunction with the Ballymena Business Improvement District.\n  \nSummer Sounds at Broadway’s inaugural performers will be hugely popular local bands Picture the Sound, and The Resolution, with stilt-walkers, jugglers and more on hand, from 11am.\n  \nMayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor Lindsay Millar, said: “Summer Sounds at Broadway promises fantastic outdoor entertainment for all ages and will create a great atmosphere in the town centre every Saturday over the coming months.\n  \n“We want this brilliant new venue to be used by both budding and established artists from across Ballymena and further afield as a platform to showcase their talent.\n  \n“I’m delighted we have already secured local artists in Mid and East Antrim to perform at Broadway, where they can be enjoyed by locals and visitors to Northern Ireland’s number one shopping town.\n  \n“Our borough’s retailers are the very best around and you are guaranteed a very warm welcome and great service on any trip to Ballymena.\n  \n“Summer Sounds at Broadway will complement a town centre brimming with incredible independent retailers, high street giants and beautiful surroundings.”\n  \nThe structure’s recent completion marks the final stage of a multi-million pound investment in the town.\n  \nThe new venue, built by a Mid and East Antrim manufacturing firm, finally provides citizens with a fit-for-purpose community space in the centre of the town, with the series of free outdoor summer entertainment events aimed at rejuvenating the town centre and driving footfall.\n  \nIt provides the ideal space for a host of exciting events and performances aimed at showcasing up-and-coming talent from Mid and East Antrim and further afield, and promote the very best of culture and the arts in the Borough.\n  \nCreative groups and artists will be invited to book slots at Broadway.\n  \nThe name of the structure, Harmony Hub, was selected by Hollywood superstar Liam Neeson following a competition organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council in partnership with schools throughout the area.\n  \nMr Neeson said: “We look forward to the future, welcome it, adapt and attract new business initiatives. This beautiful, yet simple structure symbolises all that and more. Many congratulations.”\n  \nMore details about the winning entry will be announced shortly.\n  \nThe Mayor added: “Our Council plays a key role in driving the economy of our Borough, as demonstrated by our commitment to, and delivery of, the public realm scheme.\n  \n“This investment is all about boosting economic growth, generating jobs and bringing more people to Mid and East Antrim.\n  \n“Our thanks to our local retailers and Ballymena residents for their patience throughout the regeneration work and we all look forward to what promises to be an exciting and successful future for the town.”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev. Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport. They were making a real effort and working towards something special, something big.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out. We will get back to everyone as soon as we have strength.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8579397.1532525784!/image/image.jpg","title":"estate agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8572863.1531997113!/image/image.jpg","title":"lockhart hails donaghcloney success","story":"\nDUP MLA Carla Lockhart has congratulated Lower Iveagh West Orange District on a successful Twelfth July week and parade. \n\n                \nThis year Donaghcloney hosted the demonstration and large crowds flocked to the town.

I want to congratulate the officers of Lower Iveagh West Orange District and their organising committee, Donaghcloney Linen Greer Association. I know many hours of planning and preparation went into this event but to good avail. We had a real effort this year by the committee and residents of the village to ensure this was a week long festival and were treated to features for people of all ages with the Songs of Praise, A Drummers Tribute, a night of remembrance, the community fun night and then the Twelfth July celebrations. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“A great turnout of Orangemen and women, bandsmen, Lambeg drums and spectators with plenty of variety for children of all ages in the demonstration field.
