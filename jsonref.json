Smith, pictured here in 2001, promoted Australian-produced food at his supermarket chainMore recently, he founded the media firm Smith \u0026amp Nasht in 2010.In addition, Smith has  authored several books detailing his aviation ventures, including ‘The Earth Beneath Me’ in 1983, ‘Dick Smith Solo Around the World’ in 1992 and ‘Above the World: A Pictorial Circumnavigation’ in 1997.Who is Dick Smith’s wife?Smith’s wife is Phillipa Aird McManarney. The couple has two children together, Jenny and Hayley.Food company closureOn July 26, Smith announced the closure of his food company Dick Smith Foods in the wake of increased competition.\u0027It is my melancholy duty to inform everyone that after 19 years, I\u0027ve had to make the decision to close Dick Smith Foods.\u0027In two years’ time we will go out of business, so I\u0027m closing it down now when times are good.\u0027It\u0027s a decision forced on me because most people just want the cheapest prices and the cheapest prices will always come from overseas,’ the longtime businessman announced.Smith specifically blamed German supermarket giant Aldi, saying its practice of ‘extreme capitalism’ had ultimately ‘forced’ him to close the company he founded in 1999 as the only means of avoiding bankruptcy.          Smith specifically cited the German supermarket Aldi as to why his food store will be closingHowever, IBISWorld Senior Industry Analyst Bao Vuong said that there were many factors at play in the demise of the Australian supermarket, not just Aldi’s rapid expansion in the country as of late.He states: \u0027There\u0027s a lot of factors behind the downfall, it\u0027s not solely placed on Aldi. Coles and Woolworths and Aldi - they all had an effect on the downfall of Dick Smith Foods because consumers are price conscious.\u0027Vuong also believes that limited brand awareness hurt Dick Smith’s food company in particular, saying: \u0027It\u0027s the company itself, it\u0027s not a prominent or well-known company with Australian consumers. The lack of brand awareness contributed to the downfall over the decade.\u0027In addition, Vuong also noted that Dick Smith Foods’ higher prices compared to its competitors was a ‘large contributor’ to its closure.Despite his successful career as an entrepreneur for decades, Smith’s announcement of the upcoming shuttering of his food company wasn’t the only blow his Australian business empire has suffered in recent years.His oldest brand, Dick Smith Electronics, went into receivership in 2016.Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

A teacher, or a guru, is someone who is thought to be able to remove all the darkness from our lives.Today, it is still believed in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist teachings that the mother is the first teacher of a child and the guru becomes the second mother. A person is first born as a result of the union between their mother and father and is then believed to be born again when they are accepted by a teacher, who will teach them how to become a human being.The Kathopanishad states: ‘In order to learn the transcendental science, one must approach the bona fide spiritual master in disciplined succession, who is fixed in the Absolute Truth. Thus, it has been enjoined herewith that in order to receive that transcendental knowledge, one must approach the guru.’          Today, it is still believed in  Buddhist teachings that the guru becomes the second motherGuru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendar, when Srila Vyasadeva, the son of Parashar Muni and Devi Satyavati appeared. The story associated with this celebration sees Parashar stopping by the banks of the river Yamuna while travelling one night.He stayed at the house of the fisherman chief Dusharaj and asked his daughter to ferry him to his next destination. Entranced by Matsyagandha’s beauty, which means one who smells like fish, he used his powers to give her a son.A boy with a dark complexion was born on an island and according to scripture, would then ide Vedic literature into four parts, Vyasa, which is why he was later named Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa.After this, as the Srimad Bhagavatam states: ‘Thereafter, in the seventeenth incarnation of Godhead, Sri Vyasadeva appeared in the womb of Satyavati through Parashara Muni, and he ided the one Veda into several branches and sub-branches, seeing that the people in general were less intelligent.’Srila Vyasadeva is considered the spiritual master of all teachers of Vedic wisdom because he made all knowledge of the acharyas to the entire world. He went on to ide the original Veda into four: the Sama, Yajur, Rig, Atharva, which were there explained in different texts, such as the Mahabharata.          Guru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendarAs Vedic language is difficult to understand, he then wrote appendices, now referred to as the Puranas and Upanishads, so that the everyday man could follow the teachings practically.Guru Purnima 2018Guru Purnima falls on Friday, July 27 this year on the day of Ashadha Shukla Purnima, which is also considered to be the day Lord Buddha gave his first sermon on the full moon day after five weeks of enlightenment sitting under the Bodhi tree in Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh and to this day, Buddhists worship him and his teachings on this day.In addition to this, the Hindu god Shiva is thought to have offered his knowledge of yoga to his disciples, of the ‘Saptarishis’, seven sages, on this day. The festival is celebrated in India, Nepal and other countries of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu influence.Teachers would be given gifts on this special day after visiting temples to offer their gurus respect and seeking their blessings. Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Meghan and her husband Prince Harry already have their own apartment, Nottingham Cottage, in Kensington Palace and York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate.And the Queen has also given the newly-married couple Adelaide Cottage in Windsor Castle as a wedding gift.The cottage was built in 1831, but its most famous resident was Group Captain Peter Townsend, who famously had an affair with Princess Margaret.The bedtime protocol is not the only thing the new Duchess of Sussex will have to adjust to.Along with not being able to eat certain foods in certain places, including her favourites at Buckingham Palace, it is unlikely that Royal fans will see Meghan with dark nail polish or a dress that exposes her knees, both things reportedly disliked by the Queen.It is also highly unlikely that one will see Meghan in wedges anytime she is near Her Majesty, given the monarch is famously not a fan of them. Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

So why is such a glamorous property at the centre of a controversy?One reason has to do with the owner himself, the notoriously combustible Gordon Ramsay (hence the culinary joke in the blurb) who has not always endeared himself to locals.Ramsay, it would be fair to say — a man who could start an argument in an empty room — is about as popular among some Cornwellians as the food served up at one of the sub- standard establishments featured in his Kitchen Nightmares TV show.Incidents such as the following encounter have not helped. When a resident spotted Ramsay in town and excitedly asked to have a ‘selfie’ taken with him, the irascible restaurateur is said to have pulled his cap down over his face and turned away in a hurry.‘He said he was on holiday and didn’t want to be disturbed,’ reveals a friend of the person who was left disappointed by his fleeting meeting with the celebrity chef.‘Fair enough, I suppose, but it wouldn’t have taken long to do a quick picture.’EXCLUSIVE: Hotshot Sydney recruiter is revealed as the man...Tana Ramsay reveals she has forgiven her father for hacking...Share this articleThere is a more fundamental reason, though, why, aside from his forthright manner, Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in Cornwall. For a start, his luxury holiday home in the picturesque harbour town of Fowey, which is being rented out, is his third property in the county.Second homes provoke strong feelings in places like Cornwall. The invasion of wealthy middle-class second home owners from outside has been blamed for pushing up property prices, forcing locals out of the housing market in the process, and turning parts of Cornwall into Chelsea-on-Sea in summer and ghost towns in winter.So being a second home owner three times over is unlikely to win you many friends in this part of the world.One woman summed up the opinions of many in the local community when she said that Ferrari-driving Ramsay, fined £500 not so long ago for speeding on Bodmin Moor in his Range Rover, was just ‘showing off with his money’, adding: ‘Why do you need three places in Cornwall?’          Ramsay\u0027s first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, in the village of Rock          Ramsay bought this £4million beach house in Trebetherick in 2016 to stay in while work is carried out on his residence in Rock          The latest addition to his Ramsay\u0027s Cornish portfolio: Formerly Fowey’s last bank, Ramsay acquired the building for £1.9million last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreatFather-of-four Ramsay, 51, has certainly splashed the cash around. His first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, was in the village of Rock, a favourite haunt of the young Princes William and Harry.He had this demolished, despite objections from neighbours — who are still furious with him — and got planning permission to replace the traditional beachfront home with a bigger ‘Grand Designs’ mansion currently under construction.The following year, Ramsay bought a beach house (also £4million) a few miles away in Trebetherick, simply to stay in while work is carried out on the Rock residence.The latest addition to his Cornish portfolio was formerly Fowey’s last bank but had closed before Ramsay acquired the building (for £1.9million) last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreat.Potential customers are cordially invited to ‘breathe in the beautifully-scented sea air and soak in the calm’ by the agency marketing the rental property.Of course, this ozone comes at a price: £7,000 a week, to be precise, or £3,525 for a long weekend. There’s an extra £30 charge if you have a dog. This is a standard fee, apparently, in holiday rentals, charged by the cleaners for wiping up mucky paw prints (or worse).‘It’s mad money, but people seem daft enough to pay it,’ said Paula Trewick, steward of the Fowey Gallant Sailing Club, this week.  Jetsetters: Ramsay steps out with his wife Tana in sunny Los Angeles on WednesdayHad the old Lloyds bank been so profitable, it would probably still be open today. Instead, the income from the Fowey townhouse — which has received ‘lots of inquiries’ since recently coming onto the market — will boost Ramsay’s already fabulous wealth.His restaurant empire alone is worth in excess of £46 million. He also has homes in London and Los Angeles and owns no fewer than eight Ferraris.He rakes in a fortune from his many TV commitments — including a new deal with Fox and the Discovery Channel to make a ‘Bear Grylls meets Kitchen Nightmares’ type series, which will see Ramsay travelling to the ends of the earth on culinary adventures.‘Cornwall is the place where I see Gordon really relax,’ his wife Tana said in an interview with the Sunday Times last week. But how much time does he actually spend in Rock, Trebetherick or Fowey?‘The reality is that he spends most of his time in LA,’ a source close to Ramsay told us this week.‘When he’s not there, he’s either on the road filming or working and socialising in London. Cornwall comes a very distant fourth.’          TV chef Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in CornwallIt’s a familiar story. More than a third of properties in Fowey (population around 3,000) are now second or rental homes. This has helped push the average price of a flat to over £300,000 and a detached house to more than £400,000.Yet, the typical wage across the county is less than £19,000 and household incomes are below 75 per cent of the EU average. Cornwall is among the poorest regions in Northern Europe — despite its image as a playground for the rich and famous.Only last month, residents in the fishing village of Mevagissey voted overwhelmingly to ban the purchase of second homes. The result, said councillors, proved people ‘want strong and positive local planning legislation to protect’ the area.The precedent for such a policy was set in St Ives. In 2016, the High Court ruled that St Ives could keep its ban on new-build second homes after the town voted to reserve new homes for full-time residents.The fact that Ramsay is also making a handsome profit out of the Fowey property, which shut as a Lloyds branch three years ago, has served only to inflame the debate.‘This is the sort of c*** which prices locals out of their own town,’ said Fowey resident Kerri Lee, in language Ramsay would probably recognise, on the Cornwall Facebook page. While Sarah Carter said: ‘He’s giving the impression only Hooray Henrys visit Cornwall and that simply isn’t the case.’Joseph Ryan, 18, who works in a chip shop in Fowey, believes the town is going the same way as neighbouring Polperro where ‘you can only see ten lights on in winter because all the other houses are second homes’.Second home owners are encouraged to make a donation to the Cornwall Community Foundation to help pay for affordable housing for locals.Among those to have contributed to the charitable scheme is Alex Polizzi, presenter of TV’s The Hotel Inspector, who owns a cottage in St Mawes. Gordon Ramsay indicated he would consider contributing after the scheme was launched two years ago. So did he? The Foundation declined to say when contacted this week.Second homes are also an issue in Rock but, over here on the north coast, Ramsay is embroiled in a more old-fashioned dispute.Neighbours were up in arms when they found out he was going to demolish the ‘historically impressive’ 1920s Arts and Crafts-style home he bought three years ago and build a modernist villa with white walls and a zinc façade, comprising a gym, pool, cellar and a guest annexe.In all, there were 17 separate objections. Among the fiercest critics was the tycoon who lives next door. Ironically, Andrew Nisbet, head of kitchen equipment firm Nisbets, is one of Ramsay’s biggest suppliers.Mr Nisbet’s views are spelled out in a legal letter filed at Cornwall County Council. In blunt Ramsayesque language (minus the use of the F-word), it describes the project as ‘inappropriate, unsympathetic and unneighbourly’.Mr Nisbet and his wife Anne took particular exception to the planned annexe, claiming it will compromise their privacy because the ‘window to window distance between the annexe and their residence is just 25 yards’.          Father-of-four Ramsay, 51, has acquired an impressive Cornish property portfolioThey also said that Ramsay’s plans to increase the height of the chimney will lead to smoke being blown towards their windows.Nevertheless, the original house has now been bulldozed and work has begun on a new main house and annexe.Until recently, at least, a sign on the site read: ‘Gordon Ramsay Construction.’ We were unable to establish if this was a genuine firm or whether Ramsay was just having the last laugh at his neighbours’ expense. Not surprisingly, you can cut the atmosphere with a (chef’s) knife in this corner of Rock.Annie Haynes, whose home overlooks Ramsay’s, said: ‘The house he bought was a wonderful place, but he has just stuck two fingers up to the concerns of those of us who have to live here all year round.‘The whole of Rock has changed in recent years. A lot of properties overlooking the estuary have been sold and more of them are being knocked down and new houses put up. Many are monstrous — all metal and windows.‘The old traditional homes no longer seem good enough for the people who come down here a couple of times a year. In winter, the place is deserted.’When the dispute first erupted, a spokesman for Ramsay said that ‘Gordon, Tana and the family are very much looking forward to spending time in their new home in Cornwall. They are committed to, and delighted to be investing in, the future of the Cornish community they will hopefully be part of for many years to come.’Ramsay, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, is a regular customer at cafes and pubs in Rock.‘He has been very polite so far,’ said one local. ‘We get the feeling he is on his best behaviour because there has been a lot of anger about him knocking down the house. But that’s what the rich do around here. They buy somewhere for the view and tear it down so they can put something trendy up.’Ramsay thrives on controversy, though. Indeed, he has made a career out of it — both on and off camera.He was once inseparable from his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, who managed Gordon Ramsay Holdings, until they fell out when Ramsay accused Hutcheson of plundering £1.4 million from his business and sacked him.Hutcheson was jailed for six months last year after an expert hired by Ramsay discovered he had hacked into the company’s computer system following his dismissal.As someone who worked closely with Ramsay for many years says: ‘Gordon will go to great lengths to get what he wants and feel that he’s winning.’A fact which will undoubtedly fill his Cornish neighbours’ hearts with sorrow. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/28/17/4EA5D17300000578-6002543-This_year_the_48th_International_Day_took_at_the_Royal_County_of-a-4_1532796367210.jpg","title":"Hubbie home kids Zara goes solo polo","story":"    Zara Tindall has made one of first appearances since having her second child last month  The International Day combines fast-paced test match polo and film, fashion, entertainment \u0026amp societyAbbey Clancy puts on a leggy display in thigh-split spotted...Love Island\u0027s Rosie Williams takes the plunge in a peach...Share this articleZara, 37 and husband Mike\u0027s new arrival Lena Elizabeth, believed to be a nod to Zara\u0027s grandmother the Queen, was born at Stroud Maternity Unit in Gloucestershire weighing 9 lbs 3 oz on June 18. This year the 48th International Day took place at the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club, Winkfield, Windsor for the first time.                This year the 48th International Day took place at the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club, Winkfield, Windsor for the first time.

Richard Kellawaythe chairman of Mrs May\u0027s Maidenhead Conservative association Richard Kellaway said if Brexit plans were diluted further they would not be acceptableSome of the key features of the plan being pushed by the government are a new free trade area based on a \u0027common rulebook\u0027- requiring the UK to commit to a treaty to match EU rules.But this would not include banking or legal services, meaning the UK could set our own regulations.Also a new \u0027facilitated customs arrangement\u0027 removing the need for customs checks at EU-UK ports.It would allow differing UK and EU tariffs on goods from elsewhere in the world to be paid at the border. And continued use of the EHIC health insurance card.The details hammered out at Chequers became part of the government\u0027s Brexit White Paper which was released to much criticism. The plan upset senior Conservatives who favour a harder Brexit, leading to the resignation of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis.New rules ending freedom of movement but allowing UK and EU citizens to travel freely without visas for tourism and temporary work. David Davis,supposedly warned the Prime Minister about the position she was taking.He said: : \u0027On customs and on goods the paper is not in line with the Government\u0027s core promises to take back control of its laws and to have an independent trade policy.\u0027He added: \u0027The Government should be up front that this meant the harmonisation of legislation with the EU and being a rule taker for swathes of the economy.\u0027The levels of discomfort among grassroots members of the party is sure to alarm the Prime Minister and her team during the summer break.Despite the concerns the Prime Minister seemed to be in good spirits on her week long walking holiday. The Mays were spotted arriving at a luxury hotel on Lake Garda, the shores of which are home to a host of exclusive hotels.The PM is well known for her love of walking holidays and last summer went to the Swiss alps. Theresa May, who is well known for her stylish footwear, stepped out in £50 white canvas flats for the walk on the shore of the fashionable Lake Garda.The photograph taken in Desenzano del Garda continued the less posed style she has adopted since being in Number 10, in contrast to images released by her predecessor David Cameron when he went away.She paired her trainers with beige three-quarter length trousers, a white short-sleeved shirt and large square sunglasses for a low-key look as they took in the small resort town that the couple visited last year.Philip walked beside her wearing dark blue trousers and loafers, with a short-sleeved blue checked shirt and smaller sunglasses.The couple will spend around a week in Italy before she returns to work in her constituency and Downing Street. Mrs May is also due to attend a First World War memorial event to mark the battle of Amiens, which began on August 8 1918 and helped to secure victory.They will then jet off for two weeks in Switzerland.

Overjoyed wife of Britain\u0027s newest cycling...Share this articleA proud Cardiff boy with a down-to-earth personality, he said he was looking forward to \u0027normality\u0027 by watching breakfast TV in bed with a coffee.The £445,000 he wins from the victory will be shared with his Team Sky colleagues, but sponsorship from his success is likely to boost his earnings into the millions.With Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome\u0027s success, it is the sixth win in the past seven years by a British rider.

Football star Gareth Bale (left) and rugby legend Sam Warburton in their earlier years\u0027I don\u0027t think Hollywood could have come up with it. You could not have written it.\u0027Thomas, 32, is three years older than Bale and Warburton. But just like them he shared a love for all school sports and excelled in athletics. \u0027I\u0027ll never forget it, and I still see it now, how Geraint ran down that home straight in the final of the 1500 metres,\u0027 Mr Williams said.    Geraint Thomas aged 16 in his school sports portraitMany such shared stories made a book Thomas wrote a few years ago a publishing hit and genuinely one of the best in cycling\u0027s vast literature.He told of shaving his legs as a 14-year-old in a Port-a-loo at a race in Germany. Loving his first cycling-specific shades so much that he barely wore them. Suffering such an extreme case of the chronic fatigue cyclists call \u0027bonk\u0027 that, after pedalling home, \u0027I just kept nudging the doorbell with my forehead in the hope that someone inside might hear me.\u0027After 21 days in which the French have made it patently clear how much they loathe the clinical, robotic, po-faced Team Sky machine, grinding on to victory, Thomas provides the antidote. Never has one deeply unpopular team more needed a winner as self-deprecating and human as the man they all call \u0027G\u0027.There was normality from the start - not least school-days at Cardiff\u0027s Whitchurch High School where Thomas, Gareth Bale and Sam Warburton were all alumni within a three year period in the last decade: a Welsh golden generation if ever there was one.A life in cycling seems to have been a happy accident. The nine-year-old Thomas had turned up to swim at the local leisure centre, when he peered through a fence and saw the local Maindy Flyers club training on the track which encircles a neighbouring athletics track. \u0027He came along a few days later and had a go himself,\u0027 the club\u0027s Debbie Wharton said on Friday. \u0027When he first started, he was just like any of the other kids on the bike, wearing baggy shorts and trainers.\u0027 The Lycra came later. Despite prodigious early promise, many were coming around to the view that the 32-year-old had been cut out for a life in the slipstream.His years at the Tour de France have been defined by his work as a domestique for Chris Froome. A bad day is \u0027when Froome is alone in the front group of twenty and there are sixty kilometres to go,\u0027 he said in the book, \u0027The World of Cycling, According to G.\u0027 (Even the title is a mickey-take.)A good day is \u0027when you deflect every nightmarish arrow slung at you. One by one, you throw yourself onto the pyre so that your leader may be venerated.\u0027           Froome (right) appreciates the contribution Thomas has made to his four Tour de France winsHe has venerated Froome far less than Sir Bradley Wiggins, despite shepherding him to three Tour de France titles. It is impossible to avoid the impression that he likes Froome far more. Thomas found Wiggins\u0027 mood unpredictable, though he has found Froome\u0027s lack of ego and often vacant personality endearing.In one of their early encounters, Froome wore a traditional Kenyan sarong - \u0027also known as a towel worn as a skirt,\u0027 Thomas drily observed.Thomas also delighted in Froome\u0027s lack of cycling knowledge. \u0027Who\u0027s that Astana guy? He\u0027s quick,\u0027 he asked Thomas after the 2013 Tour of Oman. \u0027Mate, it\u0027s (Vincenzo) Nibali,\u0027 Thomas informed him.\u0027The success hasn\u0027t gone to his head,\u0027 Thomas has said of Froome. \u0027He can handle the mickey-taking - about how he stays upright on his bike, that he knows nothing about anything but cycling today. Tell him you\u0027re watching the Six Nations and he\u0027ll ask which six and why, what are they doing?\u0027 Even in the last three weeks, he\u0027s been brutally straight about his own place in their dual pecking order. \u0027I\u0027m just \u0027erm… maybe a bit more than a pawn,\u0027 Thomas said after the defining Stage 12, when he eased away from Froome to record an historic second consecutive stage win at Alpe d\u0027Huez.That was the evening Chris Boardman wondered aloud about whether all this modesty was actually a cover for a slight mental deficit.           The Welshman, who rode 20 stages of the 2013 Tour with a broken hip, is treated after a crash          Thomas early in his career as an older teenager racing for a Welsh team, years before he would become a world champion\u0027He\u0027s had several opportunities in the past and… folded, Boardman said on ITV. \u0027I think he\u0027s a little bit fragile on that front and it\u0027s a way to deflect the pressure.\u0027It was an allusion to the solitary off-days which Thomas always seems to have had in the mountains. He was fourth overall after a brilliant Stage 17 climb three years ago, but calamity on La Toussuire two days later saw him lose 22 minutes. He finished 15th.Others who know Thomas well agree that his career in the shadows of others have left the question of that elusive winning mentality answered. \u0027Others were always the stars,\u0027 one source tells Sportsmail. \u0027First Mark Cavendish, who he came through the track academy with, and then Wiggins and Froome on the road. \u0027The elite competitors tend not to be normal. Thomas is balanced. You could have a pint with him. That\u0027s not normal where these kinds of competitors are concerned.\u0027                        "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/29/19/4EAC5FAC00000578-0-image-m-11_1532889011049.jpg","title":"How wealthy elite run Royal Albert Hall profiteering","story":"    Many regard the Last Night of the Proms (pictured in 2013) as a once-in-a-lifetime experienceTo understand why, one need only spend a few minutes using the internet to search for information about the aforementioned Last Night, where the BBC Symphony Orchestra will this year be conducted by Sir Andrew Davis.The unique celebration of British patriotism has been one of the hottest tickets in showbusiness for years.To secure one of the 5,272 seats, which cost the (relatively) bargain price of between £27 and £100, most ordinary members of the public must first attend at least five other Proms concerts. That entitles them to enter a hugely oversubscribed ballot for the right to buy a ticket.Many thousands of classical music enthusiasts go down this arduous road every year. Many regard the Last Night as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Attending is a hard-earned privilege.Unless, that is, you have oodles of cash to spare.For, as so often in our increasingly commercial internet age — where everything seems to have its price — a hefty quantity of tickets also happen to be freely available to those prepared to throw vast sums of money at the problem. So it goes that websites such as the ticket re-sale site Viagogo were this week advertising seats in the stalls for £1,000 each.The world premiere of Donizetti\u0027s L\u0027Ange De Nisida fails to...Holiday firm Thomas Cook reveals it will stop selling trips...Share this articleTo sit in a box in the second tier of the auditorium, you must fork out £1,600. The going rate for a \u0027grand tier\u0027 box seat, regarded as the best in the house, is nearer £2,500.These prices are not, of course, being charged by the event\u0027s organiser, the publicly-owned BBC. Nor are they being levied by the Albert Hall which, as I have pointed out, is a charity.Since members of the public don\u0027t receive their ballot tickets until a few days before the Last Night, very few of them are in a position to cash in, either.Instead, the vast majority of the tickets being flogged so shamelessly turn out to belong to a lucky — and, as we shall see, increasingly controversial — breed of inidual known as a \u0027Member\u0027 of the 151-year-old Royal Albert Hall.Members currently own some 1,270 of the venue\u0027s seats, and they are each issued tickets to around 250 of the events that take place there each year.These include not just the Last Night of the Proms, but also such sought-after events as upcoming gigs by Cliff Richard, Jools Holland, Billy Ocean and The Beach Boys.Members of the Hall, a mixture of iniduals and organisations, can buy or sell seats on the open market (one in the stalls currently fetches around £150,000). They pay an annual fee of around £1,500 for upkeep, and in return are able to do whatever they want with their tickets.          Rock stars Roger Daltrey (pictured) and Paul Weller called the practice \u0027ludicrous\u0027 and \u0027despicable\u0027Many choose to return unwanted ones to the box office for resale at face value to the wider public. For this they receive a good share of the spoils, totalling around £5,000 per year per seat should they give up their ticket for every event.Should members feel like maximising their financial returns, however, they can sell tickets for otherwise sold-out events on the open market. This can produce a substantial profit: some estimate between £15,000 and £20,000 per year per seat.The list of members at the centre of this row provides a fascinating insight into the changing nature of Britain\u0027s financial elite. Where once the list was dominated by philanthropists, boxes are now owned by major corporations such as Shell, BAE Systems and Aviva Insurance.Anonymous financial entities control still more. A firm called Palmyra Holdings, based in the tax haven of Jersey, controls five.Two boxes are owned by Astor Care Tickets Limited, a subsidiary of a company run by a doctor named Brian Cheung, that runs an Oxfordshire care home which has been much criticised by the Care Quality Commission.Sixteen seats are controlled by the Albermarle Booking Agency, which runs them commercially. Coutts, the royal bank, and a Guernsey-based entity called Newstead Enterprises control others.The Queen\u0027s lady-in-waiting, the Hon Mary Morrison, owns two seats, while Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin has a box.There is no suggestion that any of these iniduals or companies flogs their seats online (a friend assures me that Mary Morrison, for one, finds the practice \u0027despicable\u0027), but the fact that some members do put tickets up for resale at huge mark-ups has prompted criticism from a host of performers.Rock stars Roger Daltrey and Paul Weller called the practice \u0027ludicrous\u0027 and \u0027despicable\u0027. Harvey Goldsmith, the Live Aid promoter, described it as legal, but \u0027morally reprehensible\u0027.Five years ago, to cite one example, The Times revealed that Earl Spencer, who owns a box of 12 seats, was using the internet to sell his tickets to an Eric Clapton gig for a whopping £4,470, including fees.          The Royal Albert Hall is governed in a manner which contradicts normal guidelinesMoreover, several trustees own large numbers of seats, many of which were purchased as investments, and are flogging tickets in a manner designed to maximise returns. Between them, the board controls 160 seats, which are conservatively valued at £25 million. Should they choose, they could make between £2.6 million and £3.2 million a year with them.The Charity Commission believes this situation to be deeply at odds with standard practice, which dictates that trustees should never financially benefit from their role with a non-profit organisation.They also say it presents a potential conflict of interest: while the Royal Albert Hall\u0027s formal objective is to \u0027promote . . .the Arts and Sciences\u0027, trustees\u0027 decisions on how to fulfil this brief could, in theory, be influenced by a desire to maximise their personal income. For example, board members might be tempted to use their influence to ensure that a particular slot in the calendar was used for a concert by a modish pop star, rather than a worthy (but less desirable) classical music event featuring, say, a youth orchestra.Or they might resist a proposal to make the Last Night of the Proms one of the 150-odd events each year for which members are not given tickets, but are paid a flat rate so the entire Hall can be let to a promoter.Such situations are, so far as we know, entirely theoretical. The Royal Albert Hall admits there is \u0027an authorised conflict of interest in our constitution\u0027, but says it is \u0027managed through a conflicts of interest committee\u0027, to protect the organisation\u0027s \u0027integrity\u0027.However, the Charity Commission takes a different view. The regulator believes it to be wholly unacceptable for a majority of trustees to be exposed to such a conflict of interest.Last year, it asked the then attorney general Jeremy Wright, the Government\u0027s most senior law officer, to refer the structure of the Hall to the Charity Tribunal, which rules on charity law.The attorney general initially agreed, only for the charity to make what the Commission described as \u0027legal threats\u0027. Mr Wright therefore changed his mind in March \u0027to prevent unnecessary litigation\u0027, asking the regulator to seek an alternative solution.That has not proven possible. So earlier this month, the Commission re-applied to the attorney general for the matter to be ruled on by a tribunal. Inevitably, the Royal Albert Hall is once again consulting lawyers. An expensive legal showdown beckons.\u0027A gang of very wealthy iniduals, who have property rights that are under threat, are sure to hire the most expensive lawyers in the land to defend them,\u0027 is how Paul Palmer, of Cass Business School, puts it. \u0027So the Commission will have to take them on. But they are, in my view, bringing charities in general into disrepute. So it\u0027s a case that needs to be heard.\u0027Sharon Hodgson, a Labour MP who campaigns against ticket touting, agrees. She has called the situation at the Hall \u0027shameful\u0027 and says \u0027action needs to be taken\u0027.Certainly, the sums involved are considerable. Last year, the billionaire industrialist Jim Ratcliffe spent £2.76 million on a 12-seater box in the Grand Circle.In March, a neighbouring one went on sale for £3 million. \u0027Boxes of this nature tend to appreciate greatly over time and are a genuine generational purchase,\u0027 said the agent, Harrods Estates.Two of the most controversial members of the Royal Albert Hall are a financier named Leon Baroukh and his family, who own around 50 seats, and Richard Waterbury, the chairman of pensions for a chemicals company, who controls 29.Their seats appear largely to be run as investments, which is particularly provocative since both Baroukh and Waterbury are senior members of the Royal Albert Hall\u0027s board of trustees.Does their combined commercial interest in the charity — worth upwards of £13.5 million — mean they should be excluded from involvement in running it?The Commission says yes.

Richard Kellawaythe chairman of Mrs May\u0027s Maidenhead Conservative association Richard Kellaway said if Brexit plans were diluted further they would not be acceptableSome of the key features of the plan being pushed by the government are a new free trade area based on a \u0027common rulebook\u0027- requiring the UK to commit to a treaty to match EU rules.But this would not include banking or legal services, meaning the UK could set our own regulations.Also a new \u0027facilitated customs arrangement\u0027 removing the need for customs checks at EU-UK ports.It would allow differing UK and EU tariffs on goods from elsewhere in the world to be paid at the border. And continued use of the EHIC health insurance card.The details hammered out at Chequers became part of the government\u0027s Brexit White Paper which was released to much criticism. The plan upset senior Conservatives who favour a harder Brexit, leading to the resignation of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis.New rules ending freedom of movement but allowing UK and EU citizens to travel freely without visas for tourism and temporary work. David Davis,supposedly warned the Prime Minister about the position she was taking.He said: : \u0027On customs and on goods the paper is not in line with the Government\u0027s core promises to take back control of its laws and to have an independent trade policy.\u0027He added: \u0027The Government should be up front that this meant the harmonisation of legislation with the EU and being a rule taker for swathes of the economy.\u0027The levels of discomfort among grassroots members of the party is sure to alarm the Prime Minister and her team during the summer break.Despite the concerns the Prime Minister seemed to be in good spirits on her week long walking holiday. The Mays were spotted arriving at a luxury hotel on Lake Garda, the shores of which are home to a host of exclusive hotels.The PM is well known for her love of walking holidays and last summer went to the Swiss alps. Theresa May, who is well known for her stylish footwear, stepped out in £50 white canvas flats for the walk on the shore of the fashionable Lake Garda.The photograph taken in Desenzano del Garda continued the less posed style she has adopted since being in Number 10, in contrast to images released by her predecessor David Cameron when he went away.She paired her trainers with beige three-quarter length trousers, a white short-sleeved shirt and large square sunglasses for a low-key look as they took in the small resort town that the couple visited last year.Philip walked beside her wearing dark blue trousers and loafers, with a short-sleeved blue checked shirt and smaller sunglasses.The couple will spend around a week in Italy before she returns to work in her constituency and Downing Street. Mrs May is also due to attend a First World War memorial event to mark the battle of Amiens, which began on August 8 1918 and helped to secure victory.They will then jet off for two weeks in Switzerland.

There remain major questions over how much of the waste put out for recycling by households actually is recycled (file picture)Amounts going to incinerators have risen in recent years, while a high proportion is sent for recycling abroad.The export trade in recycling material took a blow last year when China announced it would stop accepting large amounts of western rubbish.          Local councils are in charge of recycling policies in their areas and governments have been slow to be involved since the first councils to abolish traditional weekly bin collections found themselves facing a backlash from the public a decade ago.The new compulsory recycling systems introduced once-a-fortnight collections of general waste.However voters showed their disapproval in local elections and ministers in Gordon Brown’s government tried various schemes to push up recycling rates without upsetting voters.These included a pay-as-you-throw bin tax and a kitchen slopbucket system, which is now in use in many areas, in which food waste goes in a special bin and householders have to use up to eight different recycling boxes.The three-weekly system is seen by its backers as a way of pushing up recycling rates while causing the least upset among voters.Martin Tett of the Local Government Association told the Sunday Times: ‘Our own polling shows that eight out of 10 people are happy with the way their local council collects their rubbish.’Rubbish piles up as families wait three weeks for bin collections | News | The Sunday Times"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/29/22/4EAE0DAC00000578-6004975-image-a-2_1532898821232.jpg","title":"Mystery surrounding Malaysian Flight MH370 laid rest final report","story":"    MH370 Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah is believed to have downed the aircraft in an act of murder-suicideAfter years of investigations, the mystery surrounding doomed flight MH370 could finally be laid to rest.The Malaysian government will release its final report on the aircraft on Monday, more than four years after the plane went missing en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing in March 2014.Years of investigations have found no firm evidence as to what happened to the Malaysia Airlines plane, which was carrying 239 people including six Australians.The Malaysian Minister of Transport Anthony Loke said the report would be released on Monday after families of those on board were briefed. \u0027Every word recorded by the investigation team will be tabled in this report,\u0027 he said.\u0027It will be tabled fully, without any editing, additions or redactions.\u0027          Pieces of debris have been found as far away as La Reunion (pictured), but the main body of the plane has still not been locatedMore than four years after the aircraft vanished on March 8, 2014, investigators have had little luck in finding the wreckage of the plane that vanished with 227 passengers on-board, plus the captain, co-pilot and 10 crew.Captain Zaharie Shah, who was going through a marriage breakup, is believed to have downed the aircraft in an act of murder-suicide, by erting from the flight path and plunging into the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Western Australia. Pilot claims MH370 could have been found years ago if...Did MH370 pilot REALLY deliberately kill everyone on board?...Share this articleThe four-year search for MH370 ended in May after the US-based technology firm Ocean Infinity failed to locate the plane while canvassing 125,000sqkm of the Indian Ocean.Malaysia had signed a \u0027no find, no fee\u0027 deal with Ocean Infinity to resume the hunt for the plane after the official search led by Australia, Malaysia and China was called off in early 2017.           The Malaysian Minister of Transport Anthony Loke said the report would be released after families of those on board were briefed Several theories have emerged about how the plane disappeared, with some suggesting the plane was hijacked and others believing someone on board may have deliberately turned off the plane\u0027s transponder before erting it over the Indian Ocean. \u0027I FOUND IT ON GOOGLE EARTH\u0027 An Australian engineer, Peter McMahon claimed he found what appeared to be a plane wreckage on Google Earth.After years combing an online map of the Indian Ocean, the amateur crash investigator claimed to have found the wreckage \u0027riddled with bullet holes\u0027.WAS MH370 STOLEN?Prior to the plane\u0027s disappearance, Captain Zaharie Shah had listed the small island of Diego Garcia - 4700km northwest of Australia - on his flight simulator.Theorists suggested that Capt Shah may have been practicing landing the plane on the island\u0027s airstrip, which is controlled by Britain but is home to a US naval base.Suggestions have also been made that the plane may have been stolen by terrorists and hidden in North Pakistan, or even by North Korean dictator Kim Jong un.In a 2014 poll on the MH370 disappearance, five per cent of American respondents said they believed it had been affected by \u0027alien activities\u0027.

Football star Gareth Bale (left) and rugby legend Sam Warburton in their earlier years\u0027I don\u0027t think Hollywood could have come up with it. You could not have written it.\u0027Thomas, 32, is three years older than Bale and Warburton. But just like them he shared a love for all school sports and excelled in athletics. \u0027I\u0027ll never forget it, and I still see it now, how Geraint ran down that home straight in the final of the 1500 metres,\u0027 Mr Williams said.    Geraint Thomas aged 16 in his school sports portraitMany such shared stories made a book Thomas wrote a few years ago a publishing hit and genuinely one of the best in cycling\u0027s vast literature.He told of shaving his legs as a 14-year-old in a Port-a-loo at a race in Germany. Loving his first cycling-specific shades so much that he barely wore them. Suffering such an extreme case of the chronic fatigue cyclists call \u0027bonk\u0027 that, after pedalling home, \u0027I just kept nudging the doorbell with my forehead in the hope that someone inside might hear me.\u0027After 21 days in which the French have made it patently clear how much they loathe the clinical, robotic, po-faced Team Sky machine, grinding on to victory, Thomas provides the antidote. Never has one deeply unpopular team more needed a winner as self-deprecating and human as the man they all call \u0027G\u0027.There was normality from the start - not least school-days at Cardiff\u0027s Whitchurch High School where Thomas, Gareth Bale and Sam Warburton were all alumni within a three year period in the last decade: a Welsh golden generation if ever there was one.A life in cycling seems to have been a happy accident. The nine-year-old Thomas had turned up to swim at the local leisure centre, when he peered through a fence and saw the local Maindy Flyers club training on the track which encircles a neighbouring athletics track. \u0027He came along a few days later and had a go himself,\u0027 the club\u0027s Debbie Wharton said on Friday. \u0027When he first started, he was just like any of the other kids on the bike, wearing baggy shorts and trainers.\u0027 The Lycra came later. Despite prodigious early promise, many were coming around to the view that the 32-year-old had been cut out for a life in the slipstream.His years at the Tour de France have been defined by his work as a domestique for Chris Froome. A bad day is \u0027when Froome is alone in the front group of twenty and there are sixty kilometres to go,\u0027 he said in the book, \u0027The World of Cycling, According to G.\u0027 (Even the title is a mickey-take.)A good day is \u0027when you deflect every nightmarish arrow slung at you. One by one, you throw yourself onto the pyre so that your leader may be venerated.\u0027           Froome (right) appreciates the contribution Thomas has made to his four Tour de France winsHe has venerated Froome far less than Sir Bradley Wiggins, despite shepherding him to three Tour de France titles. It is impossible to avoid the impression that he likes Froome far more. Thomas found Wiggins\u0027 mood unpredictable, though he has found Froome\u0027s lack of ego and often vacant personality endearing.In one of their early encounters, Froome wore a traditional Kenyan sarong - \u0027also known as a towel worn as a skirt,\u0027 Thomas drily observed.Thomas also delighted in Froome\u0027s lack of cycling knowledge. \u0027Who\u0027s that Astana guy? He\u0027s quick,\u0027 he asked Thomas after the 2013 Tour of Oman. \u0027Mate, it\u0027s (Vincenzo) Nibali,\u0027 Thomas informed him.\u0027The success hasn\u0027t gone to his head,\u0027 Thomas has said of Froome. \u0027He can handle the mickey-taking - about how he stays upright on his bike, that he knows nothing about anything but cycling today. Tell him you\u0027re watching the Six Nations and he\u0027ll ask which six and why, what are they doing?\u0027 Even in the last three weeks, he\u0027s been brutally straight about his own place in their dual pecking order. \u0027I\u0027m just \u0027erm… maybe a bit more than a pawn,\u0027 Thomas said after the defining Stage 12, when he eased away from Froome to record an historic second consecutive stage win at Alpe d\u0027Huez.That was the evening Chris Boardman wondered aloud about whether all this modesty was actually a cover for a slight mental deficit.           The Welshman, who rode 20 stages of the 2013 Tour with a broken hip, is treated after a crash          Thomas early in his career as an older teenager racing for a Welsh team, years before he would become a world champion\u0027He\u0027s had several opportunities in the past and… folded, Boardman said on ITV. \u0027I think he\u0027s a little bit fragile on that front and it\u0027s a way to deflect the pressure.\u0027It was an allusion to the solitary off-days which Thomas always seems to have had in the mountains. He was fourth overall after a brilliant Stage 17 climb three years ago, but calamity on La Toussuire two days later saw him lose 22 minutes. He finished 15th.Others who know Thomas well agree that his career in the shadows of others have left the question of that elusive winning mentality answered. \u0027Others were always the stars,\u0027 one source tells Sportsmail. \u0027First Mark Cavendish, who he came through the track academy with, and then Wiggins and Froome on the road. \u0027The elite competitors tend not to be normal. Thomas is balanced. You could have a pint with him. That\u0027s not normal where these kinds of competitors are concerned.\u0027                        "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/29/23/4EAE5CE600000578-6005103-image-m-4_1532903839057.jpg","title":"England rugby star Ben Foden romped PR girl 26","story":"      It\u0027s over!

It now wants to increase its involvement in mixed-use schemes to include offices, hotels, student accommodation and flats. Deer Park primary school in Richmond will have a new home over two floors above a Lidl store, including an outdoor playground with space for games such as football and hockey. The project is expected to completed next year.Property experts said Lidl’s plans were likely to be fuelled by the difficulties in gaining planning permission for new stores in London at a time when existing retailers are struggling to make ends meet.The discounter wants to open at least 50 stores a year around the country and also aims to relocate to larger stores in some city locations as it rides a consumer switch towards cut-price chains.Promising to build flats and facilities such as schools can help to persuade councils that a new development could be beneficial to their community.Lidl’s home-building spree echoes a technique already widely adopted by the mainstream supermarkets, particularly Tesco and Sainsbury’s. Tesco built hundreds of homes above its stores in Woolwich, south-east London, and Streatham, south-west London, while Sainsbury’s was part of a joint scheme with Barratt Homes involving 700 homes in Nine Elms, near Vauxhall, south-west London, and recently won permission for a £200m project in Redbridge, east London, involving 683 homes. Morrisons has also entered the game, winning permission late last year for a plan to build nearly 600 homes as part of the redevelopment of its Camden store in north London. Supermarkets have also been involved in hundreds of small-scale urban developments, such as transforming moribund pubs into local convenience stores with a few flats above.With profits under pressure as a result of rising costs and sluggish sales, retailers are keen to maximise the income they can make from the sites they own. Selling or renting out homes or other developments above the shop can help to ensure a site is profitable.“Lidl and Aldi both need to aggressively push into the south-east, especially London, and the only way they can afford to pay a premium for development sites is to also do residential,” said Tom Edson, a supermarket expert at the property consultancy Colliers. “Having people above the shop is not a bad thing. It means you have got a ready customer base,”Under its UK managing director, Christian Härtnagel, who took the helm in 2016, Lidl has developments linked to 476 homes in the pipeline, about half of which will be linked to a store in Alperton, north-west London. A store with six flats above it is also due to open in Dartford, Kent, next week and more will go up in Epsom, Surrey, by 2020.Lidl is planning to build some of the homes itself while others are part of wider schemes led by developers. It is understood that the firm wants to focus on affordable homes rather than luxury developments, in line with its money-saving image.Härtnagel said: “We’re proud that our stores are increasingly helping to pave the way for mixed-use developments, which in turn are supporting important initiatives. It continues to mean a great deal to us that we are able to support many of the communities that we’re a part of by providing added value above and beyond affordable food.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35224d0fe9832329942f547a66fe1d4882efd546/0_285_5600_3361/master/5600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=af474be6e61c46bf7127a46bf8222a3c","title":"most capital cities are well off but london is like another country","story":"Incomes in inner London are five times as high as in the Welsh valleys or CornwallAll countries have their regional differences. States in the American Deep South are poorer than those in New England. In Germany, Bavaria is richer than Brandenburg. The struggling parts of Italy are south of Rome.But Britain is in a class of its own. The gap between the richest and poorest parts is wider than in any EU country. Incomes per head in inner London are five times as high as in the Welsh valleys or Cornwall.There are two sides to this story. One is the stupendous growth of London – a city that is now fit to bursting. The other is the sluggish performance of Britain’s older industrial towns – the bits of the country that were worst hit by de-industrialisation and have been slowest to recover from the recession of 2008-09.As Fothergill notes, it would be surprising had there been no employment growth at all during a period when the economy was expanding. “But with job growth so much slower than in the cities, and far slower than in London, the evidence is that the economy of Britain’s older industrial towns is essentially stagnant.”Pay and conditions in older industrial towns are often poor: a direct consequence of the slack in the labour market since it allows employers to dominate when it comes to setting pay and conditions. Low pay means the Treasury has to foot a hefty bill for tax credits, which are running at £6bn a year in the older industrial towns. Increasingly, they are becoming dormitory towns for people who work elsewhere.What the report clearly shows is that London has effectively become a separate country, with stronger job links to the international labour market than it has to the rest of the UK. There was an 800,000 increase in the number of London jobs between 2010 and 2016, accompanied by a 530,000 increase in economically active people from overseas of working age.In the past, the sort of employment growth seen in the capital between 2010 and 2016 would have sucked in workers from the regions but during the post-recession period the number of UK-born workers living in London dropped by 320,000. These people – driven out of the capital by over-crowding and rocketing property prices – moved to the home counties and commuted into London.International migration is a prominent feature of recent trends in the towns, although not nearly to the same extent has been seen in London. At an estimated 160,000, net international migration of economically active working age adults was roughly three-quarters of the 220,000 job growth in older industrial towns between 2010 and 2016.As the report notes, without the net inflow of migrants from abroad the size of the workforce in the older industrial towns would have declined. The increase in the number of workers from overseas filled skills gaps and also probably allowed some firms to expand faster than otherwise would have been the case. “But in adding to labour supply, migrant workers may also have eased the pressure on employers to offer better pay and conditions,” it adds.A number of conclusions can be drawn from this report. The first is that urgent action needs to be taken to tackle London’s over-heating. Primarily, that involves building more homes, either in London itself or within easy commuting distance.The second is that there is a need to bring more well-paid jobs back to the towns that make up a quarter of the country’s population. That means the right mix of macroeconomic (competitive exchange rate), regional (active industrial strategy) and educational (focus on training and skills) policies.The third is that in the absence of serious action to tackle London’s capacity constraints and to revive the old industrial towns, there will be political pressure to curb immigration. As Beatty and Fothergill note, there is scant evidence, other than through the tax revenues generated by London that are recycled in public spending, that London’s spectacular employment growth since 2010 has had any positive benefit for Wales, Scotland and the north.The north-south ide is becoming more pronounced, with the old industrial towns feeling ignored, separate and un-listened to. Given the history of the past four decades, that’s not surprising."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c2badb05d9f8269d4d735eb298064e7b6e043d1/0_92_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b5b5acf2be8053d9e9c0f1fdf29524c","title":"zimbabwe rival parties results election","story":"“Mugabe has gone. Things will never be the same again.” For pretty much the average life expectancy of many Zimbabweans, one man has ruled the country with an iron fist. Eight elections were held during his rule – and every time, that fist ensured victory for Robert Mugabe.On Monday Zimbabweans go to the polls to elect his successor. The current president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, 75, the man who finally ousted Mugabe in a bloodless coup last November, has also crushed his enemies ruthlessly in the past – but his iron fist lies within a well-padded velvet glove.Mnangagwa goes head to head at the polls with Nelson Chamisa, 40, who took over as leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) after Morgan Tsvangirai died earlier this year.Whoever wins, this election heralds a new dawn for Zimbabwe. Mugabe has gone. Things will never be the same again. Certainly Mnangagwa brings a lot of baggage from the Mugabe era – having been the former president’s righthand man. But he is different in many significant ways – today, Mugabe even urged voters to turn their backs on his leadership, and went so far as to wish Chamisa well. Most importantly, Mnangagwa understands business and is determined to resuscitate Zimbabwe’s moribund economy and give the people what they so desperately want and need – jobs.He is primarily a soldier, having left Zimbabwe as a teenager in the early 1960s for military training in China. He has fashioned himself after the former communist leader Deng Xiaoping, who modernised China and laid the foundations for the economic powerhouse it has become, while maintaining a strictly authoritarian regime.Deng abandoned many orthodox communist doctrines to incorporate elements of the free-enterprise system. Mnangagwa seems determined to do the same for Zimbabwe. He is a wealthy man in his own right, having run Zanu-PF’s and his own businesses since the early 1980s. He has been mentioned in a UN report on the plundering of mining and logging resources in the Democratic Republic of the Congo together with General Sibusiso Moyo, who is now the foreign affairs minister.While Mugabe was a consummate manipulator, skilfully playing people off against each other and weaving a complex web of patronage, Mnangagwa is a much more of a strategist. He will be prepared to make tough decisions that could ultimately benefit the economy. He has certainly been more successful in attracting foreign investment in the short time he has been in power than Mugabe was in decades of berating the west.The MDC’s Chamisa is just as pro-business as Mnangagwa, and to his credit has surrounded himself with several capable technocrats. There is no whiff of corruption about him and he has been drawing massive crowds in many rural areas which, under Mugabe, were no-go areas for his party. And of course the MDC’s democratic and human rights credentials are well established – while those of Zanu-PF are a constant cause for concern.Should Chamisa win the election, there is no doubt that the world would welcome Zimbabwe back into the fold with open arms. But Mnangagwa is smart enough to realise that international recognition of his government can only come if this election is acknowledged as free and fair by the global community. While Britain has been unswervingly supportive of the post-Mugabe regime, the US has reserved judgment – recently renewing its sanctions on Zanu-PF leaders and companies, but promising to lift them once credible elections have taken place.And there’s the rub. Many believe it is impossible for the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission to run a free and fair poll. It is accused of rigging every election since it was established in 2004 it is still staffed largely by the military and Zanu-PF loyalists and it has shown shameful bias towards the ruling party in recent months. For example, the law says the ballot paper should be in alphabetical order, which places Chamisa second on the 23-person list. The commission cleverly formatted the paper into two lop-sided columns, in order to place Mnangagwa at the very top of column two.So this election could bring three possible results: if Mnangagwa wins, the MDC already has enough ammunition against the electoral commission to cry foul. If Chamisa wins convincingly, it will be a new dawn indeed – but the military might not accept this, as the generals have already invested a lot in Mnangagwa.But if there is no clear winner, the most sensible way forward would be for the two protagonists to agree to a marriage of convenience – otherwise known as a government of national unity.• Wilf Mbanga is the founder, editor and publisher of The Zimbabwean weekly, published in the UK and Johannesburg"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c03114b054c5913a40589dd799d965301d15db5/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?w=465\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3d9fe85a9f0e8673fa5acdb353cca736 930w","title":"denver nuggets where to eat and drink in colorados capital","story":"From the best pizza to the finest brewpubs, if there’s a restaurant or bar worth knowing in the Mile High City then chances are that local food doyen Kade Gianinetti has tried it out.

Add to that five gold medals at this year’s World Beer Cup Awards (or the Olympics of brewing, as it’s known), more than 100 artisan tap rooms, and the simple fact that beer tastes better looking at the mountains, having climbed mountains or talking about going to the mountains tomorrow. Like a brew with a view? Here are some of Denver’s top hop spots: Tivoli Brewing Company Denver’s oldest brewery has been serving up frothy refreshments since the first settlers arrived in 1859. Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city. Their Dear You French saison is already a classic beer.Denver Beer Trail With four walking routes – each through a different downtown neighbourhood – covering 14 miles and 35 taprooms in total, this is the ultimate craft-brew pub crawl, a half-marathon of beer. Great American Beer Festival Held in Denver each October, this is the largest beer party in the country, with more than 3,500 artisan, classic and rare brews on show. Want a sip of each?

By the time of his death in 2011 at the age of 72, he had amassed an astonishingly comprehensive collection of vintage film posters.Now that collection, featuring some of the world’s best-loved stars, including Clint Eastwood, Sean Connery and Harrison Ford, in films such as Hitchcock’s Vertigo and Spielberg’s Raiders of the Lost Ark, will go under the hammer at a Surrey auction house on Thursday.East had been a film fan while growing up in the small town of Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, often seeing six different releases a week in the local cinema. During his life as a schoolteacher he carried on the hobby, sharing the enthusiasm with his partner Pat, until her early death. At that point, in grief, East immersed himself in the world of film memorabilia professionally and set himself up in the collecting and dealing business, recruiting his brother, Alex, to help him run a series of small stalls.He collected a vast range of posters, portraits, stills, magazines and books, and from the early 1990s ran a Saturday stall at the Electric Ballroom in Camden. From there he moved to a grander plot at Westminster Central Hall, attracting clients from Europe.“This is a truly eclectic collection that has mass appeal because of the extensive crossover interest,” said Alastair McCrea, a specialist valuer at Ewbank’s.Highlights of the sale include a large scale poster for Thunderball, the 1965 James Bond film starring Connery, with a guide price of between £1,500 and £2,500.

He talks ‘wokeness’, vindication and Trump’s AmericaSpike Lee has heard all his film-making life that he is preoccupied with race. Sometimes the criticism has not come from obvious voices. Back in 2000, when Lee suggested that a lot of African American comedy and music – including gangsta rap – was not far removed from minstrel shows, the actor Jamie Foxx observed: “I think it’s getting to the point where nobody cares, because he talks about it so much that now he’s just become the angry guy, the angry black man.”For a long time, Lee has been proposing an idea of America – that its stories should be told in the context of its violently racist past – that not everyone wanted to hear. In the present political moment, however, with the president that he calls Agent Orange in the White House, he is, obviously, unrepentant. People are rethinking films of his, he suggests, that they previously might have dismissed. And having mostly been ignored by the major award juries for the past 30 years, Lee, aged 61, is once again picking up prizes.Often the criticism of his work has been coded. Two weeks ago, I mentioned to Lee in his studio office in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, that, having read a selection of three decades’ worth of reviews and profiles before our interview, the description of him that surfaced most often was “provocateur”. That word sometimes seemed to be used as a euphemism for “uppity”.“I can just about live with provocateur,” Lee says, weighing me up with his sparky, seen-it-all eyes from behind outsized, orange-framed glasses (in person he is anything but angry – considered, thoughtful, quick to laugh). “The one that gets me is ‘controversial’ – ‘the controversial director.’” He dislikes the tag because it suggests he sets out only to shock. Mostly, Lee believes, over the course of more than 40 films – beginning in bravura style with the liberating She’s Gotta Have It in 1986 and continuing through Do the Right Thing and Malcolm X and Clockers and Miracle at St Anna – he has simply been telling it like it is.Many of those films have been conceived in this building – a pair of brownstone houses converted into a three-storey studio space, only a couple of blocks from where Lee grew up and from where his father, Bill, a jazz musician, now 90, still lives. The office is something like a museum to the director’s obsessions, or a glimpse inside his head – the walls are lined with paintings and artwork relating to Jackie Robinson and Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X and Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson, as well as posters of his own films. You have the sense of him circling around these reference points, feeling for what has changed, and what has not.Lee’s latest expression of the facts of American life – BlacKkKlansman, which was awarded the Grand Prix at the Cannes film festival – is the true story of Ron Stallworth, the first black detective in the Colorado Springs police force who, in 1978, went undercover with the Ku Klux Klan. The story began bizarrely enough, when Stallworth saw a recruitment ad for the KKK in the classifieds of the local newspaper. He called the number, raised the pitch of his voice a couple of notches, and made up a tale about his disgust at his white sister dating a black man. He was immediately invited to join up. Working as a double act with a white Jewish cop – Stallworth on the phone, his partner in the hood and robes – he infiltrated the group, and, in a series of unlikely twists, not only ended up being proposed as leader of the local chapter, but also became the telephone confidant of David Duke, the “grand wizard” of the white supremacists. Duke eventually came to Colorado Springs personally to initiate Stallworth into the Klan.The film, like all of Lee’s films, enjoys some wicked shifts of tone, in this case designed to make his audience smile at some of the historical ironies even as they are asked to confront the vivid extremes of American bigotry. Lee is a master of comic caricature and the Klan members offer scope for a full range of racist imbecility. In Stallworth’s memoir, the undercover cops foil a planned nail-bomb attack on a gay bar. Here, the targets of the Klan’s plotting are black student activists who invite Stokely Carmichael, the former Black Panther, to speak at their campus, which allows Lee to appropriate some of the style of the post-blaxploitation era.In a coincidence not lost on the director, at the same time that Stallworth was infiltrating the Klan, Lee was involved in some anti-fascist action of his own.In the summer of 1980, in his first few weeks at NYU graduate film school, Lee’s class was shown DW Griffith’s 1915 epic The Birth of a Nation (for more than a century the film, which depicts the rise of ritual white nationalism, has been a defining cultural symbol and recruitment tool for the Klan). Lee’s class were taught not about that violent social history, however, but rather asked to use the film to examine the technical innovations that made Griffith the “godfather of American cinema”. “That disturbed me,” Lee says.His response was a student film – his first – called The Answer, in which a young black director is hired by a Hollywood studio to remake The Birth of a Nation from his own viewpoint. Inevitably, that vision becomes compromised by the studio and the young director pulls out of the film. Along the way he becomes a target for the Klan himself. The final scene of Lee’s student movie involved a cross-burning on the lawn outside the director’s window, prompting him to head out, with a knife in his hand, to confront the Klansmen. When The Answer was shown at a faculty screening, some staff members were reportedly shocked by the “aggressive” tone of the film two recommended, unsuccessfully, that Lee should not be invited back for the final two years of the doctoral programme.If that sounded far-fetched in 1978, it sounds tragically less so now. “This guy in the White House,” Lee says, “has given the green light for the Klan, for the alt-right, for the neo-Nazis to come out in the open. There is no need for the so-called dogwhistle any more, they are in full daylight.”BlacKkKlansman ends, in a typical Spike Lee payoff, with graphic news footage from the violent Unite the Right march in Charlottesville last August, which ended with the death of Heather Heyer, who had been protesting against the torch-lit rally. He also uses footage of the president’s shaming assertion that “both sides” were to blame for that violence, and of Duke himself, the racist undead, endorsing Trump’s rise (while suggesting that a few of Trump’s ideas – building the wall, America First – had been stolen direct from his own manifestos).Lee didn’t start shooting his film until last autumn. When he watched those scenes in August, it was obvious, he says, that the news had written his film’s ending. He contacted Heyer’s mother for her blessing to use footage of the fatal moment when the neo-Nazi James Alex Fields drove his car into the crowd of anti-fascist protesters, killing her daughter.That must have been a tough phone call to make, I say.“It was a harder call for her. She lost her daughter in an act of terrorism. One hundred per cent American, apple pie, fourth of July, homegrown terrorism.”The film is due to be released in the US on 10 August, to coincide with the first anniversary of the Charlottesville march. There are plans for another Unite the Right rally, this time opposite the White House.For a long time, Americans have wanted to see white supremacism as ancient history, Lee suggests, but it has never been that.“The whole foundation of this country is wack,” he says at one point, on the subject. “It’s bullshit. If you go to the constitution it is written that slaves were counted as three-fifths of a human being, chattel, like cows or chickens. Unless we can come to grips with how this nation was formed and be honest about it we will never go forward.”Because Lee has been associated so closely with Brooklyn as a film-maker, it is easy to forget that he was born in the south, in Atlanta, Georgia. His father’s family was from near Selma, and the terrorism of slavery and lynchings and Jim Crow were close to home.Watching Lee’s films again, I find myself drawn to the two documentaries he has made about the south – both exceptional films – Four Little Girls, about the 1963 Birmingham church bombings, and the four hours of When the Levee Broke, his intensely human appraisal of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. It seems to me that his film-making always wants to have journalism somewhere near its heart. He agrees that those films were pivotal in some ways to how his methods have developed.In some ways, Lee – irrepressible, steeped in history – was born to that role of inquisitor of white power. His father, like his grandfather before him, went to Morehouse College in Atlanta, a celebrated African American arts institution, and was a contemporary of Martin Luther King Jr. Lee studied alongside Martin Luther King III at Morehouse in the class of 1979.Though civil rights politics were never far from the dinner table, his parents had other, equally formative impacts on him. Lee’s love for music comes from his father, who played standup jazz in Greenwich Village, and was a good enough session musician to record with Bob Dylan, Aretha Franklin and Duke Ellington among others. His mother, Jacquelyn, who died when Lee was 20, was a high-school teacher of art and African American literature, and gave him his love for cinema. “My father did not like movies – there were no films about black people and he didn’t want to see the Hollywood stuff,” he says, “so as the eldest son I was my mother’s date.”What did she take him to see?“One of the first was Bye Bye Birdie at Radio City Music Hall,” he says. “It’s funny, that opening scene of Do the Right Thing, in which Rosie Perez dances to Fight the Power, that came, I realised later on, from the opening of Bye Bye Birdie and Ann Margret singing about Birdie being drafted.”That attitude – that he could rewrite the history of American cinema in his own way – seemed fully formed from the beginning in Lee’s film-making. In the past year or two he has reconnected directly with those early films by remaking She’s Gotta Have It as a Netflix series.It was the idea of his wife, Tonya Lewis Lee, a film producer. “She watches a lot of series, Amazon, Netflix,” he says. “And she could see a way to do it. We shopped it around and Netflix said OK.” After a successful first run, he has just finished working on a second 10-part season following Nola Darling’s love life.The space between the series and the original film documents not only subtle changes in sexual and racial politics, but also the dramatic gentrification of his Brooklyn neighbourhood. The original film was as much a collective expression of the group of artists and actors he lived among here in the mid-80s as anything else. Does he still feel that community is possible?“It is,” he says, “but it depends on there being a place where artists find it affordable to live. A young Andy Warhol in Pittsburgh, or even a young Madonna in Michigan, could not make it to New York and exist here now.”He doesn’t believe online hubs can replace those communities.“It’s gotta be face to face. We were all bumping into each other on the block here.” He fetches a picture from the studio’s bathroom wall of the coolest-looking Bloomsbury set of all time and runs through the names: “Chris Rock. Joseph Simmons from Run DMC. Bill Stephney from Public Enemy. A few of them are still around.”It is an irony not lost on Lee that the look and success of his own film first made Fort Greene attractive to property developers. If you walk up from his studio across the park to his old house now, it is full of children’s nannies pushing state-of-the-art buggies, and financiers and lawyers jogging with focus, or pulling along exotic dogs. The brownstone houses have mostly been tricked up in heritage paints and sell for many millions of dollars. Lee has been a fierce critic of this process, which he inadvertently set in motion, and has been given to public rants about it, such as this infamous one to a local gathering a few years back: “There were brothers playing motherfuckin’ African drums in Mount Morris Park for 40 years and now they can’t do it any more because the new inhabitants said the drums are loud. My father’s a great jazz musician. He bought a house in 19-motherfuckin’-68, and the motherfuckin’ people moved in last year and called the cops on my father. He’s not – he doesn’t even play electric bass! It’s acoustic! Here’s another thing: when Michael Jackson died they wanted to have a party for him in motherfuckin’ Fort Greene Park and all of a sudden the white people in Fort Greene said: ‘Wait a minute! We can’t have black people having a party for Michael Jackson to celebrate his life. They’re gonna leave lots of garbage.’ Garbage? Have you seen Fort Greene Park in the morning? It’s like the motherfuckin’ Westminster dog show.”He is less animated about the fact when we meet. How does he feel walking around here these days? “It’s like all over,” he says. “It’s like Brixton, where I used to hang out in London. I guess it’s safer now, but it’s not the same.”Though he maintained his studio here, Lee and his wife and two children, then toddlers, moved out 20 years ago when they bought a 8,292 sq ft town house on the Upper East Side on Manhattan that used to belong to the painter Jasper Johns and, before that, to Gypsy Rose Lee. He has never been shy of accumulating or displaying his wealth, though in the past he has tried to claim, somewhat ridiculously, that he is not “rich rich”. “Rich is Spielberg. Lucas. Gates. Jay-Z! Oprah Winfrey,” he once observed, “that’s a ton of money. Compared with them, I’m on welfare.”Still, he can just about remember what it was like to have nothing. She’s Gotta Have It was shot in summer 1985 in two six-day weeks for a begged and borrowed $175,000 – and made $7mI wonder if, looking back, he knew when he took that gamble he would end up where he is at 61?In all that time, more than two dozen movies, he never seems to have been undone by doubt?“There is no way I could be in the position I am now, if I had doubt,” he says. “That came from my parents and grandparents – even if they had thought it, they never once said: ‘You can’t do that.’ They said: ‘We support you, but you gotta work hard.’ You had to bust your ass.”He shows no signs of stopping. The spur is never a fear of failure, he says, but simply storytelling. There are always more stories crowding in to be told.We talk a little about the horror show of American politics. On the day we meet, Trump is in the UK Lee is amused by the fact that the English have been able to take out their World Cup sorrows on the presidential visit: “Perfect timing.” He wants to make the point, too, that his film is not exclusively or “quintessentially”, as Cate Blanchett said in handing over the award at Cannes, “about an American crisis”.“This stuff is happing in France, Germany, Italy, Britain. The rise of the right. You have Brexit. We just do it bigger and better than anyone else! But you start to rally your nation around the scapegoat, the villain, the immigrant, we know how that ends, right? What was the first thing Trump said? All Mexicans are rapists. That’s where it began.”His own antidote to that is the two-word phrase that has been a feature of almost every film he has made, beginning with the last words of his second feature, School Daze, which ended with Laurence Fishburne’s character exhorting his audience to “Wake Up!” Does the contemporary urgency to be “woke” make him feel vindicated?“I get no joy from being right,” he says. “I want to be wrong. I wanted there to have been some progress. ‘Wake up’ has been like a refrain for me. And I’m still saying it.”I suggest to him that if we’d had this conversation a decade ago, he might have begun to believe that things were changing. Barack and Michelle Obama had grown up with Lee’s philosophy – they had gone to see Do the Right Thing on their first date in 1989 – and they were on their way to the White House. In a New Yorker profile of Lee in 2008, at the time of Obama’s nomination to the Democrat ticket, he declared that their progress was “ordained – it’s providence. I think this is going to be such a pivotal moment in history,” he said, “that you can measure time by BB, Before Barack, and AB, After Barack.” When I quote that to him now, he rocks back in his seat, and lets out a roar.“I was wrong about that! Though in one way it’s true in that Agent Orange – his only agenda is to dismantle everything Obama did. I think it goes back to that correspondents’ dinner when he sat there in the audience and President Obama tore him another anus. After that, as soon as he put his right hand on that lying Bible, he was getting rid of everything that Obama had done.”How does he see the next year – or the next week – going?“My friends call me Negrodamus!” he says, laughing broadly. “Negrodamus! But I can’t help thinking it’s going to be ugly. What is really amazing is these house Republicans. How do they sleep at night? They are up there co-signing this hatred. You have to think these guys just kneel and pray at the altar of the almighty dollar. They would put their mother on the corner. That is what we are up against.”What about hope?BlacKkKlansman is out in the UK on 24 August.

Or just a change of underwear and a scarf that doubles as a hat? As the holiday season begins, five intrepid travellers reveal their packing secretsMy grandmother, Ludmilla, once disembarked in New York accompanied by two children and 32 suitcases. Taxi drivers on the quay cursed with wild amazement, but what looked to them like reckless extravagance turned out to be natural and understandable. In how we pack is who we are.Ludmilla had been a child refugee, a White Russian whose mother took her by circuitous routes to Shanghai, where they were poor and stateless. Marriage brought more wealth than happiness. Internment during the war reduced her to the corner of a hut and few possessions. Her packing regime in subsequent years of plenty suggests Ludmilla’s things were her security suitcases were defences against uncertainty that began in a childhood on the road.“Our things can become imbued with our essence,” says the psychologist Dr Christian Jarrett, “and associated with strong personal memories. We use them to convey our identity. With packing there is the mundane aspect of not wanting to forget anything practical, but there is also sometimes a deeper anxiety around more meaningful possessions.”Ludmilla idolised America. No wonder apprehension about her status and her reception there drove her to pack pretty much everything.Jarrett goes further: “For particularly cherished items there may even be the anxiety over whether it is better to take it with you (and risk losing or damaging it) or to reluctantly leave it behind, thereby temporarily letting go of a part of ourselves in the process.”To my grandmother, it seems, the idea of having things, or not having them, was more important than their use. As suitcases come out all over the country, there is something of Ludmilla in many of us. The anxiety of packing, for those who find it stressful, would seem to come partly from a pressure to ide a self which is represented by possessions. At some level we are selecting those aspects of ourselves that will not only serve us in Scarborough or the Seychelles, but which will also define us there.“Huh!” I hear you snort. “Check the weather, take something comfy, something smart and a costume for the beach.” But then there are toiletries, outfits, chargers, electronics, shoes for different activities, coat or not, books, hat, the luggage allowance to consider, and you haven’t even thought about the children’s stuff yet. Or, more likely, you have sorted them out and left your packing until last. How many hold bags are you checking in? Are you going to trust they all get there, or ide essentials between them? As allowances have shrunk, security increased, travel exploded and possessions multiplied, to pack a bag in 2018 is now a fine art. We need an expert.“Packing is one of those many things that I feel I know more about than any other person living,” says the narrator of Jerome K Jerome’s Three Men in a Boat, who was spared those mean little measuring cages and airlines devoted to wringing cash out of every kilo. After much mishap he concludes: “It is lumber, man – all lumber! Throw it overboard.” This is the philosophy of the accomplished packer who resides within, squabbling with our inner Ludmilla.For men: “One good shirt with a collar, and a really good toothbrush” is your baseline, according to a man I met who once rowed a boat around Spitsbergen. For women: the novelist Louisa Young recommends one silk dress: “Rolls up tiny, in case an ambassador invites you to tea.” She took the tip from her sister, who went around the world on a motorbike.Frequent travellers and female flight attendants recommend a shawl or pashmina, for the same reason Buddha got by on a sarong – what garment is more versatile? During years of travel writing, a cotton scarf has been my hat, sunshade, eye-mask, pillow and towel. In common with the millions of fans of Lee Child’s Reacher novels, part of me yearns to roam the world toting only a toothbrush, free of clutter, master of my own fate, or of my possessions, at least.The luggage industry understands this yearning for control and has helped us to overcomplicate things in the name of simplification. Enter the packing cube, plastic wallets that fit inside a suitcase – bags to go inside bags, extra packing for the neurotic packer, and environmental lunacy, but they have their fans.Experienced travellers treat shoes as packing cubes for underwear, socks, spectacles and breakables. Few recommend vacuum packing. If you find yourself kneeling on (another) plastic bag, sucking the air out of your smalls with a hoover, you may be taking too much.For, in packing, there is also the chance of psychological liberation, an echo of leaving home or moving house. “At a key juncture, old belongings are shed like a carapace, fostering the emergence of a new identity,” as Christian Jarrett puts it. You are not just going on holiday. You are becoming another you.So how do you do it? No doubt you are accomplished in your own method, but packing practice is a whirl of eccentricity and insight. Thom Jones, an international educationalist, travels much: “I pack a harmonica for work and pleasure. I judge a country by whether their customs staff demand that I play it,” he says.Gina Balta, a maritime historian who finds packing stressful, starts with a suitcase, then packs “clockwise from where I’m standing, and I continue to the rest of the house, always clockwise!”Simon Worrall, traveller and writer, provides a sensible rule: “If you hesitate, leave it at home.” Wide-travelling women counsel sticking to one colour palette. Deirdre O’Donnell, international consultant paediatrician, advises on having one set of clothes in your hand luggage, allowing your case to go on its travels without marring yours. “All my clothes go with each other (weird navy wardrobe) and only ever two pairs of footwear. Rolling definitely works. And never pack a towel.”A sarong fan, she is one of many who insist that rolling clothes beats folding. The more often you travel the less you tend to take.“I keep a bag ready to go,” intones the priest and presenter Richard Coles, a man constantly on the move. “Contents: change of knickers and shirt, toiletries (including hand cream), sharp knife, sleeping pills, bathplug, wet wipes.” Note the bathplug – standard kit for travellers enjoying adventurous retirements who relish transforming an imperfect hotel into a bathing spot.My wanderings yield tips from erse places. A Berber camel driver in the Moroccan Sahara watched me faffing and then gently intimated that packing is the art of putting like with like: plastic, paper and fabrics with their own kind. On this principle my luggage is a sports bag with toiletries collected from hotels in one end, notebook, guidebook, novel in the other, clothes in the middle, and it all goes hand luggage, weight being the enemy of pleasure.Travelling overland from South Africa to Wales in pursuit of migrating swallows, I found the most useful item to be a paper clip. It sounds silly, but it replaced buttons, hung mosquito nets, repaired zips and excavated splinters. I met my partner on the journey. Rebecca always takes packs of cards, transforming delays into Canasta or Go Fish tournaments.If packing for travel is essentially a reflection of a state of mind, then the best advice yet was given to me in the Kaokoveld desert, by a Namibian guide. I was about to undertake the swallow journey, following the migration route of the bird, at the end of which I would have almost nothing more than the clothes I wore. (Pilgrims and overland travellers arrive with a fraction of their initial burdens. Travel teaches the substitution of experience for possessions.)“What should I take?” I asked.“Go with a level head and a humble heart,” he said. “You’ll be fine.”I took my son abroad last month. Midway through cramming my suitcase with every conceivable solution to every conceivable problem that could possibly arise during the course of a single 96-hour trip, I was struck by a sudden epiphany. ‘You know,’ I thought, bashed between the eyes by a rare thunderbolt of common sense, ‘I bet they sell nappies in Portugal.’They do. And medicine. And sun cream. And most of the other stuff I was trying to crush into luggage for the benefit of an uninterested toddler. I’d been going mad with anticipatory panic, deluded into thinking that the UK was the only developed country on Earth, but it was all for nothing.This, I think, is a remnant of how we used to travel when every journey was a blind leap into the unknown. That uncertainty has gone. Google Maps exists now. You can locate every supermarket in a 10-mile radius before you leave home. You can trace the route there on Streetview. You can find their website to see if they stock the things you want to take. There are very few surprises with modern travel.Going anywhere with young children is stressful. They tire easily. When they want something, they want it now. Buy most of what you need when you arrive. You travel lighter. In the end we just took four changes of clothing, a day’s worth of nappies and an iPad for the entertainment on the flight. This only works to a degree, however. My brother is getting married in Bali soon. Bali is 18 hours away. I have two children under the age of four. Please forgive me for ignoring my own advice and packing a giant suitcase rammed with Ambien and gin. Something tells me I’ll need it.Stuart Heritage writes about film, music and TVI’m a night-before packer, and chaotic. I throw everything in. I’m pretty relaxed about it, and I have a separate wardrobe in a different room for my holiday clothes.I’ve been caught out by technology in the past. I now leave all my global adaptors, a couple of chargers, a hairbrush and spare hair tongs in my suitcase. I have a separate beauty bag – moisturiser, night cream, foundation, and I sometimes take a travel iron with me.I overpack on accessories. Jewellery can be a game-changer, especially for work. If you need to take a look from day to night, a statement earring or cuff can transform a look. For the shows, I take 15 pairs of shoes for about six days, but probably only wear five pairs. My styling represents two sides of myself: there’s the riot of colour, and a real-life wardrobe of white, black and gold.Packing for children is a joy. My daughter is six and we share a suitcase. She will end up with 10 unworn summer dresses and I’ll always be a few items short.I’m pretty low maintenance when it comes to a beach holiday. I’ll take five bikinis (I’ll usually pick up another, and get a new bikini before I go), two pairs of sunglasses and two hats (put underwear inside to keep their shape) – one straw Panama style, and one wide-brimmed – and a gorgeous old kaftan I’ve had forever. Something evening-appropriate, too. I get a spray tan. I don’t want to go in the sun and I don’t want to look white. I have a routine: spray tan, mani, pedi, then you are beach-ready and all those clothes instantly look better and you are in the zone. It’s a ritual, like adding the bikini and the kaftan.I get pleasure from fitting everything in. Packing for a holiday is all about the dream of what’s to come, though the reality might be different. It’s like dress-up.Wherever you go in the world, you can buy what you need. As long as you’ve got your passport and credit card and enough clothing to get through your first day, you’ll be all right.Lucy Yeomans is editor- in-chief of Net-a-PorterI have a super-romantic relationship with travel. I love to explore the planet and it’s an intrinsic part of who I am. So far this year I’ve been to Nicaragua on a backpacking holiday with two friends to Ghana, Lebanon and Colombia, working on my Radio 4 documentary series The Sound Odyssey, which is about musical collaboration on a beach holiday to the Dominican Republic and to the Hay Festival. When I went to Nicaragua I was travelling around with this filthy backpack, that was really heavy and difficult to pack and unpack. My friends saw me lugging it around and for my birthday they staged an intervention and bought me a fancy suitcase. It’s changed my life. There are all these rules about what you are supposed to pack, but when I go on holiday I want to look like me. I have lots of vintage stuff, sequins, big knitted jumpers – and I definitely keep that in mind when packing. If anything, I try to experiment even more on holiday. Bright colours and prints seem to make more sense when you’re abroad. The key is to take loads of gly, exciting accessories and make-up. I’ll take some giant feather earrings or an iridescent eyeshadow, and several scarves you can turn into a sarong or a head wrap.My other essential items are a notepad and a disposable camera or a Polaroid. If I’m on holiday I like the idea of disconnecting. If you don’t take your phone out, you feel much calmer and you capture memories in a different way. I really like to take books on holiday that are about sheer escapism and I’ll always take headphones so I can listen to albums if I’m feeling anxious.I’ve got better at packing. It used to be tears at midnight, not knowing where anything is, feeling panicked and out of sorts. It’s still madness, but there’s some method in it now. My mum’s got this thing called TPM, as long as you’ve got your tickets, passport and money you can go anywhere. So I have this mantra that everything will be OK, regardless of what I’ve got or haven’t got.Gemma Cairney is a writer and broadcasterI am a hoarder by nature, but years of being separated from suitcases by airport (mis)handling, and occasionally by nosy or malign authorities, have forced discipline on me. Two days in Dublin, or three weeks in Latin America, it makes no difference. If I don’t need a first aid kit and a flak jacket, everything has to fit into my battered carry-on.There is usually one smart outfit, a couple of changes of clothes and trainers in the hope I can get out on the streets for a run, which I’ve managed in some unlikely places, including Iran, Iraq and North Korea (I’m just waiting to be commissioned for a piece on ‘jogging the axis of evil’). I also pack a sweater even for hot countries, as air conditioning can be fierce.Because I go to such a variety of places, often in fast succession, I inevitably leave something important behind, but the many missing suitcases taught me that as long as I have my passport, credit card, glasses and phone, I can probably salvage the trip. I usually tell myself this on the way to the airport, as I try to work out what I’ve forgotten.For wars and natural disasters, my packing calculation is different: it’s mostly about protection. I have to think about what the risks are and what might help manage them, from guns and bombs (helmet and body armour) to tear gas (masks), contaminated water (purification tablets), power failures (battery packs and solar or car chargers) or ordinary crime (an alarmed door wedge).The limit is what I can carry myself, usually in a backpack, so I start with a large first aid kit and work back from there. And always lots of snacks.Emma Graham-Harrison is an international affairs correspondent for the Observer and the When I saw the price of flights to Greece this summer, on an airline formerly known as budget, I realised I’d have to learn to travel light. Having already paid extra for that great luxury known as a reserved seat, I refused to cough up for suitcases – so it’s hand luggage only. I spoke to the packing expert Hitha Palepu of hithaonthego about how to pack less stuff, and to pack smarter.1. Toiletries: “I know we’re all trying to use less plastic,” says Palepu, “but I succumb to those travel-sized toiletries and then make environmental decisions elsewhere.” She keeps a permanent set of small toiletries, under 100ml each, in a clear washbag that can go through security in hand luggage, and takes it on every trip, no fuss. I’m in awe. “I have one each for my husband and son, too. In summer I put in sun cream, in winter it’s coconut oil. If I’m going to need a lot of sun cream I buy more at the destination. Don’t travel with it.”2. Packing cubes: Palepu recommends packing cubes for compression – her favourites are by Gonex – so everything inside your luggage is compartmentalised. Pack like with like. Put all your chargers and wires in a pouch. Pick and choose between rolling and folding items: Palepu rolls most trousers, jeans, skirts inidually – and then secures each item with a hair band – but tends to folds shirts, because they have a collar. “But there is absolutely no wrinkle-free method for packing. It’s fabric! So I prioritise space in my luggage for a hand-held steamer, which works with an adapter. I have one that can adapt to every country’s sockets and also includes three USB ports. I bought it in some random airport years ago and haven’t blown anything up yet.”4. Get kids involved: “The sooner you get them helping you pack, the better. I never want to set an expectation that their mother does all of it,” says Palepu. I protest that involving my daughter means she will insist on bringing a full mermaid costume. “Say that you know she has to have the mermaid costume, but her swimming costume is more important, so we’ll pack all the things we need first, and then if we have room, we can add that one thing. Kids have fantasy pieces, too, and it’s good to honour that wish. It’s going to give them a little confidence about the holiday.” She recommends a CabinZero backpack that my child might be able to wear on her back.5. Underwear: Hitha’s formula is 1.5 x the number of days spent there for pants – so that’s 12 pairs for an eight-day trip. I’m confused – isn’t that too many? “If you’re going somewhere hot,” she says, “you might want to shower twice a day and put on a clean pair afterwards.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8b4b2ffa4736944ff3cb39c8e627591f7249ba3/0_186_4422_2653/master/4422.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=96c948481afc9aba152e230a5f3a29f0 1440w","title":"brexit tory ministers face constituency backlash chequers deal","story":"While the PM is on holiday, Jeremy Hunt and Philip Hammond are due in FranceA series of ministers are to head across Europe this week as the government embarks on a summer spent trying to sell Theresa May’s Brexit strategy to inidual EU leaders, while simultaneously keeping sceptical Tory activists on side.While the prime minister is on holiday in Italy, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, are due separately in France in the coming days for meetings. Other ministers are also scheduled to go on trips.Downing Street will also make renewed overtures to local Conservative associations, after it emerged that seven party chairs in areas represented by cabinet ministers have expressed scepticism at May’s painstakingly drafted Chequers plans and associated white paper.Before May headed to northern Italy – where official photographs released on Sunday showed her strolling with her husband, Philip, by Lake Garda – she stopped off in Salzburg on Friday, as a guest of the Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz.She also held talks in Austria with the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, the Estonian prime minister, Jüri Ratas, and the president of Portugal, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa.No 10 has talked up the discussions as a success, notably the agreement by Kurz that an informal European Council meeting in September, mainly focused on immigration, will also talk about Brexit ahead of a key summit next month.The intention is to target politicians and voters in the inidual EU27 nations in the hope of persuading them to take an easier line than the bloc’ chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who last week who seemed to dismiss the basis of May’s customs plan, a key plank of the Chequers proposal.“Those four meetings were all felt very positive,” a Downing Street source said. “They listened to the prime minister as she talked though the headlines of the white paper and engaged positively. And getting it to the informal European Council is going to be an important point for all European leaders to discuss that future relationship.”May also faces challenges closer to home after a series of local party chairs, among them the head of her own Maidenhead Conservative association, told the Sunday  they either opposed the Chequers proposals outright or would not back them if the prime minister had to make concessions to the EU.Richard Kellaway said a briefing on the proposals at Downing Street went down well among those present. But he told the : “I think we have reached the stage that if we don’t get a deal around these terms, then we’ll have to break away. If it were to be diluted it would ultimately not be acceptable.”Others were more outspoken. Patricia Soby, who chairs the Tory association in Torridge and west Devon, represented by the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, told the paper: “This constituency conducted our own survey and practically everybody was against the Chequers deal.”Don Hammond, chair of the Conservative association in Tatton, represented by the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, said: “This is right at the limit of what I would consider to be a Brexit and I am distinctly unenthusiastic.”A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.There is acceptance within Downing Street that local party activists tend to be more heavily pro-leave, meaning some pushback is inevitable. More briefings are planned, however, in an attempt to reassure them.The biggest setback in recent days came on Thursday when Barnier said it was not possible for the UK to collect EU tariffs as a non-member.The EU “cannot and will not delegate the application of its customs policy and rules, VAT and duty collection to a non-member who would not be subject to the EU governance structures”, Barnier told a press conference alongside the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab.Downing Street has sought to play down the apparent hostility, saying Barnier had been more positive in other areas, such as the planned backstop.“There is a chink in the Barnier armour. He’s the chief negotiator, you don’t expect him to come out with anything other than a tough line to start with,” the No 10 source said.With the Commons in recess until 4 September, May has some respite, but lingering disquiet is likely to peak at the Conservative party’s annual conference at the end of the month. Grassroots members and refusenik MPs are likely to make their feelings plain as speculation continues that she could face a leadership challenge."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea8c44745a75966a55df549bacb7448ec52a82e7/0_143_5159_3095/master/5159.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d348de913a56570d0b0354d8b7daca1f","title":"jeremy hunt visits china seeking revive golden era relations","story":"Foreign secretary also under pressure to criticise erosion of human rights in Hong KongJeremy Hunt will arrive in China for his first major overseas trip as foreign secretary, seeking to revitalise the golden era in Anglo-Chinese relations started by David Cameron, but under pressure to warn Chinese leaders to end the erosion of human rights in Hong Kong. Hunt, who inherited the trip from his predecessor, Boris Johnson, will want a surefooted start as European countries try to reassure Chinese leaders they are right to engage with multilateral institutions despite the erratic and often unilateral behaviour of the US president, notably his withdrawal of the US from the UN climate change treaty. Hunt has a Chinese wife and speaks Japanese. He has long taken an interest in Asia, and the shift in international power away from the west.He will arrive in Beijing on Monday and meet the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, the Politburo member Yang Jiechi and the foreign minister, Wang Yi. Wang and Hunt will jointly chair the ninth strategic dialogue between the two countries. They are expected to discuss multilateralism, climate change and the need to maintain sanctions to keep pressure on Pyongyang to meet its commitment towards nuclear disarmament in North Korea. Some US politicians fear China is turning a blind eye to North Korea sanctions-busting due to China’s anger at Trump’s trade war.Theresa May visited China in November, but the era of close relations – including major strategic inward investments by China – that was hailed by Cameron has appeared to be on the wane. That is partly due to the lack of an unalloyed enthusiast for China in the mould of George Osborne in the Treasury.The Commons foreign affairs select committee, which is inquiring into China’s commitment to multilateralism, has been told that Brexit will reduce Chinese interest in the UK as it seeks to make common cause with the EU to resist US trade aggression. Ahead of the visit a clutch of British foreign policy experts, including Lord Ashdown and Sir Malcolm Rifkind, urged Hunt to discuss Hong Kong with the country’s state leaders, citing concerns that pressure on human rights and freedoms in the city have “increased and intensified”.In a letter, they raised objections to the Hong Kong police force’s recommendation to ban the Hong Kong National party for posing a threat to national security through publicly promoting the city’s independence.Last week, Hong Kong’s security minister said he was considering the recommendation to ban the party, and gave the organisation and its leader, Andy Chan Ho-tin, until 7 August to convince him otherwise.The letter also raised concerns about the disqualification of pro-democracy and pro-independence lawmakers – a result of China’s top legislative body interpreting oath-taking rules in the Basic Law, the city’s mini-constitution.“Freedom of expression is facing threats from multiple fronts,” they wrote, pointing to the abduction of booksellers and the removal of academics from their posts. They added that the city’s judiciary was under pressure as Beijing’s interpretation could compromise the city’s rule of law.Britain and China signed the Sino-British joint declaration to enable the handover of Hong Kong in July 1997. The agreement set out the core principles of the “one country, two systems” concept, under which China guarantees Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy.In the letter, the five signatories said: “The United Kingdom has a unique relationship with Hong Kong due to the Sino-British joint declaration. This agreement underpins the special trading relationship that the United Kingdom has with Hong Kong because ‘one-country, two-systems’ ensures that it has the robust rule of law, freedom of information, labour rights, intellectual property rights, and transparency which our businesses need. It is also an important example in the region of a city where basic human rights are upheld to the benefit of all.”The Foreign Office insisted Anglo-Chinese relations were burgeoning, pointing to £9bn worth of major commercial deals.Speaking ahead of the visit, Hunt said: “The UK and China are both major powers with a global perspective. As the UK leaves the EU and becomes ever more outward looking, we are committed to deepening this vital partnership for the 21st century.”The trip was an “important opportunity to intensify our cooperation on shared challenges ranging from global free trade to non-proliferation”, he said. After his visit to China, Hunt will travel to France and Austria to discuss Brexit. Hunt, who is close to May, is being given a bigger role in Brexit talks than Johnson, who was distrusted inside Downing Street and not greatly admired in major European capitals."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b43f31446a802d35ea6286c527b32b8cedac40b/0_40_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=def9985b0161c424b6012f39d0a89296","title":"cardiff city praises local boy after tour de france win","story":"Members of champion’s former cycling club, friends and fans gathered to cheer his victoryThe sky was grey and streams of water ran down the Maindy Flyers cycle track, where Geraint Thomas first learned to ride competitively 23 years ago. But the sodden children and parents from Thomas’s old club in Cardiff were, for the most part, buzzing with excitement as they gathered in their yellow and blue jerseys to celebrate the first Welshman and only the third British rider ever to win the Tour de France.“It’s amazing, particularly because he came from the club,” said Sarah Tregear, whose children both cycle with the club. “We did look at flights to Paris last night, but for the children there’s no better place to be than here.” “It’s just goes show what you can achieve at Maindy Flyers. I want to be like him one day and hopefully there will be a women’s Tour de France,” said Jess Rich, who had been whizzing around the velodrome.In the city centre cycle cafe I Want to Ride My Bike there was cheering and clapping as Thomas glided towards the finish line draped in the Welsh flag. The cafe was tightly packed with damp bodies – not least because four camera crews had decided, rightly, that this was the place to catch the city’s cycling fans. “This is one of those moments when you are unbelievably proud to be Welsh,” said Jake Flynn, wearing a jersey emblazoned with a red dragon. “I think they should paint the town yellow to mark the occasion. It’s a lot a yellow paint, but his dedication should be celebrated.”The fans were not the only ones getting excited about this historic moment for Welsh sport. The Welsh assembly and Cardiff city hall were bathed in bright yellow over the weekend, in a nod to the yellow jersey that Thomas stubbornly refused to relinquish for the second half of the tour.The city council even announced on Twitter a tongue-in-cheek consultation on adding a yellow jersey to its red dragon logo. However, many of the people who know Thomas are finding it hard to come to terms with the scale of what he has achieved. Debbie Wharton, who coached him at the Maindy Flyers track, said his victory didn’t quite seem real yet. “I grew up watching the Tour de France. I was always glued to it as a kid. But to think the winner is somebody we know, who grew up down the road and went to my cycling club, is still unbelievable.” Wharton had shed tears with him when Thomas broke down in a TV interview after retaining his overall lead in the testing time trial in the Basque country on Saturday. But she found herself smiling when he immediately reached for Welsh cakes.“They are his favourite. A few years back we delivered him some homemade Welsh cakes when he was racing for Team Sky in Belgium,” she said. “The other riders didn’t know what they were.”One of Thomas’s close-knit group of Cardiff friends, Ian Jeremiah, who runs the Cyclopaedia bike shop where Thomas has his bikes fixed, was also finding Thomas’s victory hard to comprehend. “It is truly amazing. You never quite think that someone you know can win a race of that importance,” he said. But Thomas had trained hard from early on, he added. “He did this massive block of training and said to one of our mates at the start of the tour ‘it’s on’,” said Jeremiah.He may be a household name now, but his friends will help keep him grounded. “Whenever he comes back he goes out with the same group of guys he has always known. That keeps him down to earth. His group of friends hasn’t changed because he’s got more money. He’s stayed with them and they’ve stayed with him,” said Jeremiah.Steve Williams, Thomas’s former PE teacher at Whitchurch high school, which has produced a long line of sporting talent including the footballer Gareth Bale and retired rugby international Sam Warburton, was full of pride. “It is a tribute to his commitment, determination and character,” he said. “In 2007, he was 140th – and then 11 years of hard work later, he’s first.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54fe317b241bc42213b0a1cd4e911b7e0a5510d1/1013_39_1651_991/master/1651.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=464d33944fb50c2bd62d7e75e40792a7","title":"england ireland hockey world cup match report","story":"England’s World Cup is, at last, alive and they may well need the confidence boost this late victory gave them. Danny Kerry’s side required only a draw to finish second in Group B they went one better, Giselle Ansley’s 53rd-minute shot from a penalty corner earning a deserved first win of the tournament. But bigger tests than this will follow.On Tuesday night they face an unwelcome playoff for the quarter-finals against a South Korea side who, barring disaster, should be beaten the sting in the tail is that this would bring a last-eight tie against the favourites, the Netherlands, who scored 26 times to England’s three in the group stage. It will require a far more clinical performance than anything they have produced so far if they are to oust the world’s No 1-ranked team.Kerry said there had never been a chance he would try to manipulate the group’s labyrinthine permutations so that England finished third and avoided that pathway to the Netherlands. Had they pulled off a high-wire act and done so, a rematch with Ireland – by far the softer option on this evidence – would have been in their sights.But with a two-goal defeat potentially eliminating England the only option was to go out and make sure. The question had come up, he said, as they mulled over potential scenarios before the tournament, and it was eye-opening to hear that not everyone in the camp shared his view at the time.“Some athletes discussed: ‘Oh, well surely we could contrive ...’,” he said. “They’re young players, inexperienced players, and perhaps get carried away with some of the stuff that happened in the football World Cup. If you put yourself in my shoes, you’re the coach of the national team playing in a home World Cup in front of 10,000 people.“Am I really going to tell the team to stop shooting at the goal? Am I really going to tell us to let the opposition in?” It was clear enough from the start that Kerry had ordered nothing of the sort. Against an Ireland side who had already, to some surprise, won the group they controlled possession and came close twice through the captain, Alex Danson. The second time, Danson’s shot beat Grace O’Flanagan but was blocked on the line by the defender Elena Tice. That denied her a goal that would have made her the country’s all-time record scorer and meant England, their first-half threat subsiding as the wind and rain died down in east London, went in at half-time looking nervous.Sitting at the back of the stand, Kerry had barked instructions to his players with increased urgency as the minutes ticked by. Whatever he said at the interval brought a change in tempo. England flew out of the traps and might have scored when Sarah Haycroft, breaking up an ill-advised attempt from Ireland to build from the back, was denied by the impressive O’Flanagan.Moments of genuine menace from Ireland had been few but they served notice of their threat when Megan Frazer, hitherto quiet, made space on the right of the area before blazing a cross-shot wide. Three penalty corners quickly followed, the last in the series drawing a sharp save from Maddie Hinch. At the other end Hannah Martin’s deflected shot gave rise to a prolonged, often ragged spell of Ireland defending and offered hope of a grandstand finale.The pressure during the final quarter was incessant but England, wasting a near-endless stream of penalty corners, were frustrated time and again. When, from their 14th, Ansley finally fired home via a deflection off Hannah Matthews the relief was widespread.“Because everyone’s making a big deal about it the girls are getting edgy but, if we were sitting here saying, ‘You’re not getting any corners and you’re not dominating the game,’ then I would be concerned,” Kerry said. “I have to keep the bigger picture in mind. Were we the better team in the matches we’ve played? Yep. Do we need to get better at corners? Yep.. I’m pretty happy with the way we’re playing. We just need to commit to the corners.”It has been a much slower-burning week than Kerry and England had expected but the really hard work is only just beginning."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e058d61d4d5ff4367af9d9ccf583e47f16adef3b/0_118_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e62cb2ae0067d0b82d55a0571ab6f2ea","title":"kare adenegan world record wheelchair paralympian t34","story":"The custom-built £4,000 racing wheelchair that transported Kare\u0026nbspAdenegan to a world record in London earlier this month has been accorded a name of its own.“They used to be quite silly ones but now they mean a little bit more,” the 17-year-old giggles. Hence the latest model is called Karen, after her mum.“She’s been very supportive in everything I do,” her daughter attests. Years of ferrying her to training and track meetings are paying idends, with the promise of much more to come.Already a three-times Paralympic medallist before her 16th birthday, the bespectacled behemoth-in-the-making shattered the T34 100m best during the Anniversary Games, with her time of 16.80sec laying down a marker two years from Tokyo 2020.Another day, another athletic ambition fulfilled. Not bad for a girl who was banished to the sporting sidelines during the early part of her schooling in Coventry for fear that her cerebral palsy made her too great a risk to health and safety.“I’d have to do reading with other students or do slightly different activities,” Adenegan says. Frustrating and difficult at an age where the priority of most is to fit in rather than sit apart. “I don’t blame anyone,” she adds. “I think it was just down to a lack of understanding. Teachers don’t always know how to accommodate people with disabilities. It’s an education thing. Not anyone’s fault. Over time I think they will understand, especially with para sport being on television. They will understand more about what people with disabilities can actually do.”With knowledge comes power. For so many the London 2012 Paralympics pulled back the curtains on a troupe of superhumans, chair-bound figures such as Hannah Cockroft and David Weir who became overnight sensations with transformative effect.Adenegan was captivated by their speed and power. “I thought ‘wow, I want to be a part of this’.” She spun down to her local club, wheelchair at the ready, game for a go. “It was definitely a lot harder than I thought,” she admits. “It’s a very technical sport with a lot of elements to it, like the push technique. Initially, when I watched the Paralympics, I thought it looked easy, like pushing a day chair. But there’s so much to it.”She became the world No\u0026nbsp1 inside six years and the challenges keep coming thick and fast. Next month in Berlin she will chase a maiden European title but the next 12 months will bring the challenge of maintaining the upward trajectory while polishing off A-Levels in history, religious studies and\u0026nbspbiology.Twin ambitions demand sacrifices. It is school, homework, training, sleep and repeat. “It’s hard but it’s worthwhile,” she says. An ecosystem has been put in place to allow her to breathe and to offer every chance of avoiding the burnout that afflicts many who achieve so much so soon.“Debbie Flood, who is a rower, has been very supportive. I’ve been a member of an organisation called Christians in Sport and been mentored by them. I’ve also been mentored by a lot of athletes on the wheelchair side. Having people who have had those experiences, it’s been so beneficial to have that support from previous Paralympians, especially as a young athlete getting that encouragement.”Bright and eloquent, Adenegan is clearly heeding their counsel. Should she obtain a university spot, history will be her preferred subject and its totems her idols of choice. Recently she completed a school history project on Marcus Garvey, a leading figure in the development of pan‑African nationalism in the US who championed civil rights by promoting black‑owned\u0026nbspbusiness.“I was extremely inspired by him and the way that he managed to encourage people through the civil rights movement in the States,” she says. “A lot of people looked down on him – 1920s America is obviously very different to now, but the way he encouraged people to come together for a good cause was amazing.”Although Garvey died in exile in London, he remains lauded in his native Jamaica for constructive efforts against the odds and a refusal to accept restrictions and rejections. It is easy to see why his tale resonates with Adenegan.Despite capturing one of the records held by Cockroft – who has gone from being Adenegan’s heroine to competitive contemporary – Karen can expect to be pushed quicker still. “Obviously Tokyo is a huge goal so everything is really focused on that,” she says. “Whatever happens, I’ll be happy as long as I’ve done my best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd2b8a90dbfec06be4c510c3eea53e52fac1a1a2/27_14_1462_877/master/1462.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c4b3f5f43e18a4f7d55bcd7cb12657d","title":"lewis hamilton formula one grand prix","story":"• Championship leader takes second successive victory • Hamilton heads into summer break with 24-point leadLewis Hamilton has said how pleased he was to come away with a win at the Hungarian Grand Prix, having entered the weekend expecting to drop points to Sebastian Vettel and Ferrari.The British driver warned that his Mercedes team could not afford to let up in their fight with the Scuderia but he was optimistic that they would be strong in the second half of the season.Hamilton won from pole at the Hungaroring having enjoyed a dominant race on a circuit where Mercedes did not have the pace of the Ferrari. Hamilton had track position, however, and his team used it to ensure he took victory, with Vettel in second.As they go into Formula One’s summer break and coming after his win at the last round in Germany, Hamilton was beaming.“I really could only have dreamed that we would be in the position that we are in right now,” the British driver said. “Considering all factors and based on our pure performance, where we stand compared to the Ferraris. I am really happy, going into the break, particularly with back-to-back wins. I think that boost will last a long time for our team and it’s encouraging for everyone.”Hamilton now has a 24-point lead over Vettel with nine races remaining but has said he is taking nothing for granted in his attempt to win a fifth world championship. “I don’t believe there’s ever a moment that you’ve got your hands on the title or the trophy,” Hamilton said.“We’ve got a long way still to go. A lot can happen but what’s important is that we continue to keep up the pressure and keep working as we have done.“I think our work ethic has been very strong and the team morale is better than ever, the spirit is better than ever.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43ddbac0b798c0aece44a190a8084b8695f30c8d/0_36_1792_1075/master/1792.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=501828f3afbca305235bf94141b15b1a","title":"widnes castleford super league match report","story":"• Widnes 24-52 Castleford• Castleford coach says: ‘We want a home semi-final’Daryl Powell has challenged his Castleford side to secure a home semi-final after the Tigers completed their Super League regular season with an emphatic 52-24 victory at Widnes.This time last year Castleford already had one hand on the League Leader’s Shield – yet while they have gone about their business in a less explosive manner this summer they are handily placed for what lies ahead, finishing the regular season in third.“To finish third with everything that’s happened to us injury-wise is an outstanding effort from us,” the Castleford coach said. “I’m really pleased, we get a breather now due to being out of the cup, but then it’s into the Super 8s. The target is clear: we want a home semi-final.”The bigger games are still to come for both sides after the Challenge Cup break – and with one competing for a Grand Final place and the other battling relegation in the Qualifiers, the camps displayed contrasting moods by full time.Castleford were magnificent in patches, including the seven-minute period in which they scored four tries to turn a six-point deficit into a 16-point advantage which, given how brittle Widnes are at present, was always likely to be enough.For Widnes, their record 16th consecutive league defeat raises serious concern that they may not navigate safe passage through the Qualifiers.This is widely regarded as the most competitive Qualifiers in history given the strength of the four Championship sides – Toronto, Toulouse, London and Halifax – aiming for promotion. Halifax secured their place with 38-6 victory against Rochdale in the final round of the Championship regular season, while the Broncos dispatched Barrow 72-6 at Craven Park to finish second and earn an extra home game in the Qualifiers.The top three following seven rounds are automatically in Super League fourth and fifth will square off in the Million Pound Game – and results elsewhere mean Widnes face lengthy trips to Toronto and Toulouse.Their coach, Francis Cummins, was defiant post-match here. “We were always going to get things dictated to us because of our league position,” he said. “What we have to do is go to those places and win. Other teams have gone there and won, so why can’t we?”In patches, Widnes do look like a side who could compete in those games, but too often they are masters of their own downfall. Here they led early on thanks to tries from Patrick Ah Van and Rhys Hanbury, but their afternoon quickly unravelled.Tries for Greg Eden – who finished the match with a hat-trick – Jake Trueman and two for Quentin Laulu‑Togaga’e turned the game on its head before half-time. “There was some outstanding rugby played there,” Powell said of that spell.Any lingering doubts over the result were ended when Oliver Holmes and Mitch Clark crossed in the first 10 minutes after half-time, and thereafter the final half-hour was somewhat of a stroll.With the result secure Castleford could afford to take their foot off the gas, a luxury they will not be afforded in the Super 8s. Cummins was right in pointing out that Widnes will not face a side of Castleford’s quality in the Qualifiers – but even so it is clear that the Vikings face a testing two months ahead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2127a80dcbf7161d016fa97e939fd74d1197f2af/197_586_3203_1922/master/3203.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8fb9b4c3adc69a2dea134d96cfc45eb3","title":"digitalising democratic party jessica alter tech for campaigns","story":"After hi-tech won Trump the presidency, Jessica Alter wanted to put the Democrats on a stronger footing. She shares what she has learnedJessica Alter is the co-founder of Tech for Campaigns, a 7,000-strong volunteer organisation that enables Silicon Valley employees to use their digital skills to help Democratic election candidates. “The aim is to become a permanent digital arm for progressive and centrist campaigns, and give access to campaigns at any level to the people, technology and resources they need,” she says.What led you to start Tech for Campaigns. Was it the aftermath of the 2016 election? It was the aftermath of the Muslim travel ban. I had been travelling during the election and returned around the time of the inauguration and, within a week, the ban was announced. I had already been very bothered but that really pushed me over the edge and I wanted a way to feel as if I was doing something that made a real impact. When you think about that, you think: what do I have to offer? I understand tech and digital, and I know a lot of other people who do, too. I reached out to my co-founder Pete Kazanjy and we decided to find out if our friends would be interested in something like this. And they were, and that’s how it started.Did you feel Hillary Clinton’s campaign wasn’t firing on all cylinders, digitally? I just felt that, in general, the mindset of the Trump campaign was very different. Much more iterative, tech-driven – it was inspired by a digital mindset. They didn’t go in with a ton of preconceived notions, they seemed open to the idea that you can learn a lot quickly from the data and test a lot of things quickly.So the Trump campaign was working like a startup? I don’t know if the whole campaign was, but, from what I had heard, I felt that digital was being run with that mindset. I’m not saying that we should all have content farms, but that is a lot of what they did. So are you trying to fill that void? We’re trying to start not from the top, but start from campaigns that are ignored and meet their needs first. And we’re trying to be a sustainable digital arm. What happens in politics is that most of the tech is thrown away after a campaign. We are trying to build tools that are longer lasting and shared.How do you help candidates? It really ranges from basics, such as websites and digital identity, to marketing and analytics, to running paid digital for them, to more complex data science. We try to build software that can be applied to many campaigns.Do you have any sense of how many points you can add to a candidate’s vote? Nobody really knows. We can certainly look at campaign data en masse once the midterms happen. Everyone is looking for a panacea, but there’s not one thing that is a secret weapon for every campaign. We don’t go in saying that digital will be the thing that makes you win. We go in saying that people spend six and a half hours a day on a digital screen and you have to be there. Was campaign money previously spent on TV and leafleting? Not previously still. We’re helping them to change the mix. We can help educate them, explain what’s possible, help them test it and give them the talent to do it. Can you tell whether a particular inidual has voted? How granular can you go? We can tell if people have voted, but it takes a couple of months after the election. To prove causation is very difficult at best you can prove correlation.How is encouraging somebody to vote in a particular way different to persuading them to buy a holiday or take a loan? Voting is often a bit more emotional, but not necessarily that different. You have to get them on an interaction curve knowing what the product is before asking them to buy. In that way it’s very similar. You don’t just message them saying: “Hey, do you want to buy this?” You explain to them why it’s good first.What about politicians themselves? Since 2016, people who never thought they would run are raising their hand. I am really encouraged – there are people who really want to make a difference. The silver lining of what happened is a lot of new people want to be involved. Are there particular sectors or demographics that are difficult to reach digitally or are hard to convert into votes? It’s well known that it is harder to get young people to vote. If voting was digital, probably not, but you have to get them to go to a polling place or do a mail-in ballot, which they’ve never heard of. They are certainly online and it’s a great place to reach them, but they are a much more discerning audience, as they’ve grown up there – they want it to feel authentic they know how to spot an ad.Do you have any advice for the president about his Twitter account? That’s not an area I want to wade into. And I’m pretty sure he wouldn’t listen to my advice anyway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2fb12da694aec02302bd8dedb1ddace194fedbf/401_490_4060_2436/master/4060.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=05dee8af32fa26a54fd7b38d19f5bce0","title":"maya jama interview true love or true lies stormzy","story":"At 23, Maya Jama is a Radio 1 DJ, TV host and, with Stormzy, half of a UK celebrity power couple. Here, she talks hard work, family troubles, and hosting MTV’s answer to Love IslandMaya Jama has wanted to be famous before she even knew what she might be famous for. The 23-year-old TV and radio presenter admits that she couldn’t sing – “as much as I wish I could, being a popstar was completely out of it” – and after a string of auditions as a teenager, realised that acting wasn’t her bag because despite “almost making it on to Skins”, she was only ever playing “Extreme Maya or Angry Maya or whatever”.But Jama had energy and “life goals” – and one by one, she has been ticking them off at such rapid speed that it makes her physically squeal, the human equivalent of the “omg skjhskjhlslhjk” text from a best friend with good news.“It’s amazing!” she says as she whirls into the offices of MTV in a bright orange dress, bright green jacket and new, bright blond hair, carrying a double delivery of fish and chips. She has stopped to take a picture of the promotional cardboard cutouts for her new MTV show True Love or True Lies?, excited to be presenting her “first proper reality show” solo. Despite claims that it’s a completely different concept, the station has Jama hosting a reconfiguration of the format set by Love Island: hot couples, some real and some fake, living in a luxury Tuscan villa, competing to win a prize for the most “real” relationship. Danny Dyer is providing the voiceover, the gritty\u0026nbspgeezer offset to Jama’s boundless enthusiasm.“The whole point is to come after\u0026nbspLove Island – which is incredible,” she explains, “but we’re aiming to fill that gap, fill that void after it ends.” Unlike ITV2’s summer hit, there are “gay people in there, lesbians, trans, an everyday crowd mix of people. And it’s a complete headfuck,” she says through delicate\u0026nbspmouthfuls of fish and chips.\u0026nbsp“It’s like, everyone’s relationship is so different and not everyone’s lovey-dovey and kissing every five minutes. Sometimes, when you’re really in love, you’re not that touchy-feely because you’ve lived together for a few years and you don’t need to kiss every two seconds.”Technically, Jama is talking about the show, but equally, it’s a pointed two fingers to the tabloids that have been snidely speculating about the demise of her own relationship for months now. Jama is also girlfriend to Stormzy, Britain’s biggest-selling grime artist, major league popstar and Croydon’s most famous Corbyn supporter. “I was presenting before I met him,” she says with emphasis. “We have a relationship that people care about, but we both have our jobs and it is what it is. I try\u0026nbspto ignore what everyone has to say or write about it and move on.”Jama’s career has been up and coming for several years now, but her arrival has been swift. She left home in Bristol at 16 to make it in London and after years of doing bits and pieces – a show on Rinse FM, a presenting gig on an unknown sports channel – “one of the ones that pop up when you go really far down the list” – work on MTV – the last year has been about mass exposure.She has ticked off presenting an ITV gameshow (Cannonball), serious Channel 5 documentaries, stints on daytime TV (Good Morning Britain Loose Women), hosting the Mobos and landing her very own Radio 1 gig (in February, she started hosting the Saturday morning Greatest Hits show, and co-hosting Friday afternoons with Scott Mills). She has been plastered on billboards, first with modelling campaigns for Maybelline and Adidas, then with her own fast-fashion line with Pretty Little Thing. She has a podcast – “in the iTunes top 10!” – hosted by lingerie company Freya, neatly titled When Life Gives You Melons, and has an eye on developing her own chat show by “speaking it into existence”. She’s not un-busy.Jama is also unquestionably stunning. The kind that compels the camera and had Stormzy interrupt his usually music-heavy Instagram feed to post a photo of her on a knickers shoot with a caption that simply read: “Sorry, but”.Does she worry about saying no to work, in case her moment\u0026nbsppasses?“No, not at all”. She pauses. “Well, last year felt a bit like that, maybe more the year before. I know a lot of people didn’t take me that seriously and I really wanted to prove myself and show that I have worked really hard to be here – I’m not some girl they just found on Instagram.”She began her career uploading videos of herself on YouTube and has always been big across “the socials” – Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter. She ran into trouble with the latter a few months ago, when tweets she posted at 18 about “dark skin bitches” resurfaced. She does not want to talk about it – she was\u0026nbspmortified and apologised twice\u0026nbspover – and would rather talk about anything else, including her violent father, who she decided to break contact with when she was 12.“With him, I feel like it’s too little, too late in the saddest way,” she says. “I would have loved a relationship with him but it doesn’t come naturally right now. I don’t feel like reaching out to him really, and I suppose it would be different if I saw him get a proper job and sort himself out.”Jama, who is of Swedish-Somali heritage, has been watching her dad go in and out of prison her whole life. Her father has a record for violent crime, which partly prompted her to make When Dads Kill, a bleak documentary for Channel 5 in which she interviewed survivors of terrible trauma. Even her publicist admits to me earlier that the programme “wasn’t as profound” as they might have hoped – Jama’s journey didn’t end with her meeting her own father, nor was there any neat resolution. “I don’t want to get close to someone who will just fall back in the same pattern,” she says warily. “It’s such an effort – it’s like, ‘you’re an adult, come on, sort yourself out’.”She’s not sure how much the situation has affected her. “If you’d asked me at school, I would have been, like, ‘Eurgh! I don’t notice it at all, I’m fine, I don’t feel any absence.’ But as an adult you think: ‘Mmm, maybe there are little signs of my behaviour that\u0026nbspcame from his actions?’ Like, the kind of man I look for\u0026nbspis something so different to what my dad is. And maybe\u0026nbspmy independence and\u0026nbspdo-it-yourself vibe could\u0026nbspcome from him not being around.”Still, Jama says she gets\u0026nbspanxious, and Stormzy has spoken\u0026nbsppublicly about dealing with depression. “My anxiety comes from people watching me more and knowing more about me,” she\u0026nbsplaughs. “But the feeling of entering a room where you don’t know anyone but you feel like everyone’s talking about you, that alone is…” Jama mugs a pained ‘aargh’. “It’s like\u0026nbspgetting on a train and not knowing if someone’s trying to take a sneaky picture.”Stormzy, she says, is “really good\u0026nbspwith it, because you can just do\u0026nbspyour music and disappear, you don’t have to go to events and do lots of public speaking, you let the music speak for itself”. And although, she says, “he’s on a way bigger scale on a fame level, I’m more exposed to everyday interactions and just putting myself out there. I’m always talking – my voice is constantly out there.” She exhales a cartoon sigh.So what makes her angry? “Yeah, I’m not really political, I’m not gonna lie,” she says, holding up a hand. “I don’t get too involved in it, I don’t really watch the news.” Being downbeat isn’t part of Jama’s brand, I suggest. “Well, I think the world’s a bit fucked up and there is so much going on, but I try not to go too much into it because it’s just going to get me in a bad mood.”True Love or True Lies premieres at 9pm, Monday 6 August, on MTV"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41c9f05cd0d65207319d36d8e0ef58422beb913a/0_130_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=184ef5ad4d576e19fcec8c507525bbf7","title":"unforgotten series 3 episode 3 recap dci stuart spots the weakest link","story":"As the four amigos get their alibis straight, Cassie and Sunny press on with their questioning and some interesting patterns begin to emerge  Carefully plotting his own redemption arc, former DCI John Bentley is a big help talking Cassie’s crew through the when-and-where of the initial investigation. On the night of Hayley’s disappearance we have a burglary at the local church, a black car driving erratically in terrible weather and a final sighting of Hayley just after midnight. Cassie is terribly grateful and looks as if she’d quite like to take down a few of Bentley’s particulars herself. Eyes front, DCI Stuart. None of this affects the self-styled four amigos though, if you believe their accounts. The Spinney millennium do was a decidedly tepid affair, with the kids in bed by nine and the adults following them right after Big Ben rang in the new century. Praise the Lord then for Mel Hollis, who remembers a very different night – a coke-fuelled booze-up with a public meltdown by Chris, the men disappearing to the pub and the women lamenting the woeful state of their marriages into the wee hours. The problem is that even Mel has everyone back indoors by about midnight, leaving the investigation back at square one. But sterling digging from Fran places the last confirmed sighting of Hayley over an hour earlier at 11pm and Cassie knows exactly what that means. “We now have four men, variously pissed, drugged up, possibly mentally unstable and somewhere in Middenham at exactly the same time as Hayley.” You said it, guv. It looks as if the four amigos will now have to conquer their personal El Guapo. Common sense prevails at the General Medical Council and Alison Pinion’s complaint is dismissed. Tim’s relief is shortlived, though, as, upon his return, he has to field Cassie and Sunny’s questions. Hayley’s photo prompts a flashback to some kind of car trouble but, forewarned by Jamie’s phone call, he denies any memory of her from the millennium. He gets a little twitchy when the breakdown of his first marriage is mentioned, but generally gives the impression of someone who won’t crack easily. Jamila’s curiosity about her new fiance gives us some much-needed backstory on Chris. The successful CEO of his own ad agency, he was undone by a combination of poor money management and undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Debt, orce and homelessness swiftly followed. Jamila is nothing but understanding – all that’s in the past now. Cassie begs to differ. She’s more of a “the past is right now” girl and even her most gentle questioning sends him into a tailspin. She offers the sympathetic smile of a seasoned plod who knows the weakest link when she sees it. Pete’s boss Mark pays a home visit to chase up the £3,000 he stole from Mr Salthouse. Pete pays him back in cash (seemingly provided by James), apologising for the simple oversight. Mark explains to Maria how chancers such as Pete were known in the industry as FILTH (“Failed In London, Tried Hong Kong”). The encounter is fraught and it seems to be the final straw for Maria. She wants to bail on the marriage, telling him “this just isn’t what I thought I was buying”, as if she was mis-sold PPI or something. The hits keep coming for Pete when Sunny shows up to interview him. Hayley’s photo brings him back to a boozy night with a crying girl of east-Asian appearance. Surprisingly, he admits to recognising Hayley from the Spinney. He flew back to Hong Kong immediately after New Year and claims to have read nothing of the case at the time. For a practised liar, he’s really not very good at it. James has the biggest reputation and the most to lose, so it’s not surprising that he’s the one coordinating the alibis among the four suspects. His flashback is to blood on someone’s hands – his? Whatever his involvement was in Middenham, it is clear James has a conscience. He agonises loudly over which particular choice he made that ruined his child’s life, leading us to wonder what exactly Eliot saw at that millennium gathering. Who killed Hayley? How does the church robbery fit into things? Exactly how thick are the police?

The kind of state that revels in all-American, conservative politicians. On the face, it doesn’t seem the sort of place where a liberal British politician could win office.But Andrew Morris, a 32-year-old originally from Yorkshire, is bidding to do just that.Morris, who moved to Texas 10 years ago, is running for a seat in the state’s House of Representatives. He’s retained his northern English accent – if it has developed a slight transatlantic lilt – and he says that makes him a curiosity when he turns up on doorsteps making his progressive pitch for more school funding, more investment in healthcare, and higher public sector wages.“I think it captures people’s attention a little more because they want to hear what this strange-sounding guy has to say,” Morris says.“I make it part of my pitch – I just make a joke about it. I go off on a segue about how I’m possibly more patriotic than a lot of my audience because I chose to move here, and who else in the audience can say that kind of thing?”Morris was born in Rotherham before moving to Warrington and later Brighton, following his father’s career. When he was 17, the family moved to Australia, and it was there that he struck up a pen-pal correspondence with his now wife, a native Texan. In 2008, Morris moved to Texas on a student visa, and he became a passport-holding citizen two years ago.As an immigrant himself, he is not afraid to talk about a more inclusive approach to immigration and undocumented immigrants – which is anathema to many in the south.His background, however, sometimes means people are more receptive to his ideas.“Hearing from someone who has gone through the immigration process, they are really open and really curious about what I think of the whole situation,” Morris says.“I have some insight into how expensive it is, how long it is and how opaque of a process it can be. I have a sense about the challenges that immigration reform entails.”Morris co-founded a group backing Bernie Sanders during the Vermont senator’s run for president, and he is running as a progressive in Texas House district 64. One of the things he will be able to focus on as a state representative is education: specifically classroom size and teachers’ pay. Another area Morris says he is particularly able to speak to is healthcare. He is a proponent of Medicare-for-all – which would provide free healthcare to everyone in the US – and says his first-hand experience of living in countries with universal healthcare helps him allay people’s suspicions.“There’s no reason why the US, with all of their riches and all of the opportunities that it has, should trail everyone else among the most economically developed countries in the world. Nowhere else do you become bankrupt because of a medical condition,” Morris says.“I use my experiences in the UK and Australia to show that the level of rhetoric, especially from the conservative side of the political spectrum, isn’t based in any sort of reality.”“There are more Democrats than Republicans. But what I saw in previous cycles was that the Democratic candidate didn’t really run a campaign or organize effectively,” Morris said.“That’s what going to be different about this cycle – the energy and enthusiasm that a lot of people have, especially because of the current White House occupant. There’s something different about this cycle that will encourage more Democrats to come out.”If Morris does win, he’ll serve a two-year term in the Texas state house in Austin alongside 149 other representatives. At a time where there is tension between the US and the UK, perhaps a Brit in Texas could help to repair relations a little."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a52bf9899c234ec34bc5dcf882a4f48cfd5ceb0/507_453_1029_617/master/1029.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f8bb6313adb9ea72e8a82a7a107d702b","title":"french skier lost 64 years ago in alps identified with help of social media","story":"Italian police Facebook post helps solve mystery of Henri Le Masne who disappeared near the Swiss-Italian borderA French skier who went missing more than 60 years ago has finally been identified after details of a probe into his disappearance were posted on social media, Italian police said Sunday.Human remains and ski equipment were found in 2005 more than 3,000 metres (10,000 feet) up the Cime Bianche in the Valtournenche valley of the Aosta region near the Swiss border in northern Italy.The man appeared to be well off given his top-line wooden skis, said Marinella Laporta of the forensic police unit in Turin.Investigators estimated the man to have been about 1.75 metres (five foot nine inches) tall and aged about 30, with his death likely occurring in the spring.They also found glasses, a watch and pieces of his shirt with embroidered initials.Having made no progress with identification, the Aosta valley prosecutor decided in late June to post the investigation’s findings on his Facebook page, asking readers to spread the information, especially in France and Switzerland.Frenchwoman Emma Nassem heard the story on the radio and said the missing man could be her uncle, Henri Le Masne, born in 1919, who went missing after skiing in a storm near the Matterhorn in 1954.Roger Le Masne, Henri’s younger brother and now 94, also came forward.“I am the brother of Henri Le Masne ... who is likely the skier who disappeared 64 years ago. He was a bachelor and quite independent. He worked in the finance ministry in Paris,” Roger said in an email made available by the police.Roger said he had gone to the hotel where his brother had taken a room for two weeks and where he found some personal effects, including money, after he went missing on 26 March, 1954.The police said a photograph provided by the family showed glasses matching those found by the investigators.A subsequent DNA test confirmed the identification, they said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3580219.1532891820!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"large lusk housing development rejected over cycle path","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLusk Community Council  said the development would have a negative impact on traffic, and school capacity was “not adequate” to deal with increased demandA development of more than 200 houses in Lusk, north Co Dublin has been denied planning permission because the plans did not take into account a cycling route set to run by the estate. Dublin firm Dwyer Nolan Developments applied to build 228 homes on a site along Ministers Road, in Lusk. Some 193 homes were to be three-bed houses, and the developers intended to build a crèche in the housing estate. Several local residents and community groups opposed the housing development. Labour Party TD Brendan Ryan objected to the proposal on the basis a council plan for the future development of Ministers Road was not completed. Approving the development prior to the local authority’s masterplan for the area would be “premature”, his objection said. Lusk Community Council had objected to the housing plans, and took the successful appeal with An Bord Pleanála. The local group said the development would have a negative impact on traffic, and school capacity was “not adequate” to deal with increased demand.Initially approving the development, Fingal County Council said the plans must be amended to accommodate a cycle path planned to run along Ministers Road. Planning permission was granted on the basis that 27 conditions were met. However, the decision was overturned on appeal by An Bord Pleanála. A planning report from a board inspector said in principle building homes on the site was “acceptable”. But the report, completed in June, raised several concerns with Dwyer Nolan’s plans. The report said the application did not comply with Department of Housing guidelines on the appropriate housing density for the area. Greenfield sites should have at least 35 houses per hectare, where the proposed Lusk estate had 27.6 homes per hectare. Department guidelines state developments under 30 units per hectare should “generally be discouraged in the interests of land efficiency”.The report said the application “fails to make adequate provision” for the planned Lusk to Rush cycle route that would run along the edge of the site. “The proposed development would, therefore, be contrary to the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ireland s first trans pride parade takes place in dublin","story":"  July 28, 2018Participants call for improved healthcare and criticise Dublin Pride as \u0026lsquomarketing tool\u0026rsquo "},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"An Bord Plean\u0026aacutela overturns council\u0026rsquos approval for 228-house north Dublin estatePatrick Menton ready to go home since February, but cannot until hours securedSpan would realise celebrated architect Edwin Lutyens\u0026rsquo original vision for the gardensSignificant progress made on water levels, obstacles and \u0026lsquopinch points\u0026rsquo, says MinisterJournalism undergraduates at NUI Galway lodge complaints about placementsDiscussions will include the forthcoming budget and the future of the CoalitionCourts\u0026rsquo only public restaurant, running for more than 40 years, expected to become officesCase studies: Working conditions and training opportunities draw young graduates abroadA number of initiatives and projects by a range of agencies are lined-up for 2018Four career experts offer advice on what to consider when deciding on your courseCouncil declines to outline steps it has taken to tackle the aggressive and invasive weedGrassroots developments can have stronger impact that criminal legislation, says MinisterCall from OSCE reverses Government position that it did not observe polls in US and EUMore than a third of parents taking out loans to pay for uniforms and booksIrish Medical Organisation estimates there are 1,400 fewer consultants employed than are neededBruised but defiant: After 38 years, Mulholland wonders if he still has a line on societyIrish Blood Transfusion Service warns of drop in donations during summer monthsLargest hospital in the south, Cork University Hospital, has 33 vacant positionsFords - Memories of the Line paints story of working on assembly line at Marina in CorkMore than 40 modern and vintage aircraft perform as part of Bray celebration"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3580261.1532895266!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nurses and doctors await commission report on staff pay","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tNursing representatives also argue that pay rises are required both to encourage new graduates to join the public health system and to incentivise those already in post to stay there. In the coming days the Public Service Pay Commission is expected to finalise the first element of its new report: an examination on whether the country’s health service is experiencing difficulties recruiting and retaining key medical and nursing staff. The commission’s findings may not be published for a few weeks but unions and representative bodies are set to use any conclusion that recruitment and retention problems exist to press for improved pay.In essence both nurses’ and doctors’ representatives argue that Ireland is competing largely in the English-speaking world for medical and nursing graduates and that the public health service in Ireland is losing out to other countries where remuneration packages are better. Last month the Government agreed a €200 million settlement with medical consultants over its failure to pay increases under a contract negotiated in 2008.However, this did not address the two-tier pay structure that opened up after the government of the day in autumn 2012 introduced a unilateral 30 per cent reduction in salary for all consultants appointed after that time. The pay cuts were partially reversed in late 2014, but medical organisations have argued that a significant gap remains . They contend that the situation has actually been exacerbated by the recent settlement in that those appointed prior to the 2012 cut may, on foot of the new deal, be receiving up to 57 per cent more in some cases. Nursing representatives also argue that pay rises are required both to encourage new graduates to join the public health system and to incentivise those already in post to stay there. The Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation (INMO) has pointed to the failure of special Government drives to attract Irish nurses working abroad to return home.INMO general secretary Phil Ní Sheaghdha told an Oireachtas committee in July that if low pay for nurses was not corrected, “we will be unable to recruit and retain the nurses required to care for our citizens inside and outside the hospital system. That is a simple matter of fact”. Minister for Health Simon Harris, speaking at the INMO conference in May, said the Government recognised that there was a recruitment and retention challenge in nursing and health sector, although he cautioned that Ministers would await the outcome of the Pay Commission’s deliberations.However, the narrative of increased pay being needed to tackle recruitment and retention problems has been challenged in recent weeks.Separately, the Department of Public Expenditure argued in a spending review this month that there had been no mass exodus of nurses from the Irish health system. It maintained that outflows of nurses and midwives from the Irish public health system were “modest in both an Irish labour market context, and compared internationally”. It also maintained international evidence suggested that nursing and midwifery remuneration in the Irish public health system was “high comparatively”.Nurses dismissed this review as wildly inaccurate. The release by the HSE of details of hospitals being affected by up 350 vacant consultant posts will undoubtedly be seized on by the medical organisations to press the Government to address the two-tier pay system. While the difficulties of smaller hospitals in attracting senior medical staff has been acknowledged for some time, the new HSE figures show that one of the country’s largest centres, Cork University Hospital has 33 vacant consultant posts. The figures show that outside of the southsouth west- which has 67 vacancies many of the other hospital groups across the country have about 40 vacant consultant positions. The HSE report shows that there are, across the country, more than 40 vacant posts for consultants in general medicine.There are about 30 vacant posts for consultant psychiatrists and 28 for ear, nose and throat surgeons.The figures also suggest there are 18 consultant posts in emergency medicine vacant and 19 in anaesthesia.

For students, they are killers of motivation. “A student given an unconditional offer can hardly be expected to work as hard as they would have for the second part of their a-level course. Even the best school may struggle to motivate that young person, or even get them to come to school.”The number of unconditional offers given to BBB students has soaredFigures from Ucas, the university admissions service, have revealed that almost one in four students - some 24 per cent - who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer in 2017.This figure is far higher than that for top students, which stood at 4.6 per cent for those predicted to get three A*s. In 2010, just 0.9 per cent of students who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer, but this has soared by 23.1 percentage points in seven years. Dr Stephen continued: “Unconditional offers can sometimes put a student at a disadvantage: if a young person has not mastered the demands of a-level, they may not be able to cope with what is expected at university. “They can be seriously damaging to a student who is unsuited either to the course or university itself, as the dropout rate suggests.”This was the fate of one student, Eden Scott. Miss Scott was predicted AAB but dropped one grade to ABB in her final examinations, a result she feels was down to her unconditional offer.The 20-year-old from London said: “I got an unconditional offer to study American and Canadian studies at Birmingham University but that 100 per cent made me stop trying as hard as I should have. “I didn’t even want to study there that much but I just went with the unconditional offer and ended up settling when I really wasn’t that bothered. “I think unconditional offers aren’t a good idea -

It claimed that bid team used a PR agency and former CIA operatives to disseminate fake propaganda about its main competitors, the United States and Australia, in a flagrant breach of the rules set down for bidding countries by football’s world governing body.Qatar beat rival bids from the the United States, Australia, South Korea and Japan to win the right to host the competition eight years ago, and has faced questions over its shock win in the race to stage the even ever since.The alleged smears against rival bidders reportedly involved recruiting prominent figures to criticise the bids in their own countries, thus giving the impression they lacked support at home.The  contacted several members of Fifa’s ruling council for comment on the Sunday Times story. Several said Fifa’s governing body or its ethics committee should ask to see evidence of the newspaper’s claims, amid calls in Westminster for an “independent investigation” into the claims.Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani, Emir of Qatar, with the World Cup trophy after Qatar was announced to host the FIFA soccer World Cup 2022 during the FIFA 2018 and 2022 World Cup Bid Announcement in ZurichThe officials, none of whom wished to be identified, predicted that the latest allegations would not lead to Qatar being stripped of the World Cup, but it has placed renewed focus on the lengths the wealthy Gulf state went to in its efforts to secure the competition.According to The Sunday Times, the smear campaign included paying a professor £6,900 to write a damning report on the economic cost of a US World Cup.Journalists, bloggers and high-profile figures were recruited in each country to build-up concerns over their respective bids, the paper reported.It also reported that grassroots protests were organised at rugby games in Australia opposing the country’s bid, while intelligence reports were compiled in key iniduals involved in rival bids.Fifa rules say that bidders must refrain from making any written or oral statements of any kind, whether adverse or otherwise, about the bids or candidatures of any other member association which has expressed an interest in hosting and staging the competitions.Qatar said it rejected all the claims made by the paper.The alleged smear campaign appears to have been aimed exploiting a key Fifa criteria that bids to host the World Cup should have strong backing from the bidding team’s public back home.The strategy was reportedly carried out by New York communications firm Brown Lloyd Jones (BLJ), which is now BLJ Worldwide, in addition to a team of former CIA agents used to help disseminate propaganda against Qatar’s rivals.One of the leaked emails, seen by the Sunday Times, and sent to Qatar’s deputy bid leader Ali al-Thawadi, shows that the Gulf state was aware of a plot to spread “poison” against its chief rivals.  The leaked documents also revealed that a group of American PE teachers had been recruited to ask Congressmen to oppose a US World Cup on the grounds the money would be better spent on high school sports, the paper claimed.Lord Triesman, former chairman of the Football Association and England bid chairman, urged Fifa to look at the evidence thoroughly, and said Qatar should not be allowed to hold on to the World Cup if they were shown to have broken Fifa rules.He told the paper: I think it would not be wrong for Fifa to reconsider England in those circumstances ... We have the capabilities.Last month the whistleblower behind the leaked documents gave testimony to Damian Collins MP, chairman of the culture, media and sport select committee. Mr Collins told BBC Radio 5 Live that the allegations require a “proper independent investigation and Fifa should make sure that happens”.He added: “If the Qataris have broken the rules, they should face some sanctions”.Qatar was previously investigated by Fifa over allegations of corruption surrounding the World Cup bid, but was cleared in 2014 following a two year inquiry led by American lawyer Michael Garcia. He said that “for the most part the bidding process was fair and thorough,” despite certain “questionable conduct”It appears that the documents seen by the Sunday Times were unavailable during Fifa’s inquiry.The Qatar bid team has previously been accused of corruption, but was cleared following a two-year inquiry by the Fifa ethics committee.Fifa’s council lacks formal powers to launch an inquiry into the claims, but the claims are likely to be seized upon in the Gulf where relations have worsened between Qatar and Saudi Arabia since the winning bid.In a statement, Qatar\u0027s Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy said: The Supreme Committee rejects each and every allegation put forward by the Sunday Times.We have been thoroughly investigated and have been forthcoming with all information related to our bid, including the official investigation led by US attorney Michael Garcia.We have strictly adhered to all Fifa\u0027s rules and regulations for the 20182022 World Cup bidding process.BLJ Worldwide has been contacted for comment.Frank Bruno reveals he has not taken medication for three years after turning to fitness to improve mental health The Beano relaunches prank-filled fan club for 80th birthdayCountryside dwellers  feel \u0026#39left behind\u0026#39 due to poor roads, no public transport and poor broadbandGeraint Thomas: From arguing over dishes with Mark Cavendish to world cycling dominationChildren as young as five \u0026#39perpetrating sexual abuse\u0026#39 because of what they are seeing on social mediaUnforgotten series two, episode three -

At first, I wasn\u0027t sure if the email was real. I had to double check it. It had come in at midday but I didn\u0027t see it until I went to bed.I came downstairs and showed it to my parents. They couldn\u0027t quite believe it.We did not have any words.I am absolutely delighted. Dancing is what I want to do every single day. I have a real passion for it and so it\u0027s not something I find difficult or a chore. It is just what I love to do.Rachel Armstrong, 17, front, will begin her four-year training at the school in SeptemberHoning her skills Ms Armstrong trained under the watchful eye of Hilda Affleck who runs a dance academy in the North-East of England having taught at the Royal Ballet School. The elated dancer added: \u0027I am a bit nervous, but most of all I am just incredibly excited. It is such a fantastic opportunity and I am looking forward to it all. I can\u0027t wait to meet people from all over the world, and be taught different styles of dance at such a prestigious school.Rachel, who has studied at the Affleck Academy of Ballet in Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, for around six years, submitted a 15 minute video to the Bolshoi, where fees cost £17,000 a year, in March and was offered a place four days later without being interviewed.She added: We were told exactly what the Bolshoi wanted to see in the video, we recorded it in a studio and sent it off. I really hoped that I would be successful but I didn\u0027t really know quite what to expect.I was so shocked when I received the email. It is getting close now and I am know I am going to get more nervous, but I am still very excited.I am most anxious about living away from home for the first time, but I am looking forward to it as well.Her father, Peter, 54, who converted the family garage into a studio for Rachel, said: We are all incredibly proud of Rachel.It is such an amazing opportunity for her. When she got the email the course of all our lives changed in that one instance.Rachel is quiet but also very determined. She might not have wanted to get her hopes up, but deep down she really wanted to be accepted.The Bolshoi has such a fantastic reputation all over the world and Rachel has been building up to this for the past seven years.The 17-year-old will move to Moscow for four years and will need to learn the language as well as dance. However, Ms Armstrong remains undaunted saying: I\u0027m quite excited for that, like, just doing it all day, every day.Frank Bruno reveals he has not taken medication for three years after turning to fitness to improve mental health The Beano relaunches prank-filled fan club for 80th birthdayCountryside dwellers  feel \u0026#39left behind\u0026#39 due to poor roads, no public transport and poor broadbandGeraint Thomas: From arguing over dishes with Mark Cavendish to world cycling dominationUnforgotten series two, episode three - who is Adrian Mullery and what exactly is Chris Lowe’s mysterious past?Travels in Trumpland with Ed Balls, episode 1 review: entertainment trumps searing political insights in this enjoyable watchPoldark, series 4 episode 8 review - there’s still nothing like this consummate costume drama for heart-stopping, breathtaking endingsChildren as young as five \u0026#39perpetrating sexual abuse\u0026#39 because of what they are seeing on social mediaVeterans will be offered extra help from the NHS under a national scheme to help them adjust to civilian lifeBordeaux wines ravaged by fungal diseaseFifa council members call for evidence of Qatar 2022 World Cup corruption claimsCoffin for Novichok victim Dawn Sturgess will be in place before funeral to protect mournersNew York Times publisher says he told Donald Trump his attacks on media could cause violenceGrammar school superhead left students feeling suicidal with policy of exclusion for getting B grades  Zimbabwe\u0026#39s gold rush: boom in illegal mining draws hundreds of thousands to Africa\u0026#39s KlondikeEurope \u0026#39not doing its homework\u0026#39 on basic wildfire prevention, experts warnHeston Blumenthal\u0026#39s £25 Waitrose gin beaten by Aldi\u0026#39s £10 own brand bottleJohn Lewis recycled plastic towels will \u0026#39still pollute oceans\u0026#39, campaigners claimDeadly California wildfire kills great-grandmother and two childrenWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/29/14/Camp-Bestival-3.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6434111  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/29/14/Camp-Bestival-3.jpg","title":"camp bestival weather cancel close lulworth castle shut latest","story":"Created with Sketch.Organisers said they were \u0027devastated\u0027 but added it had been the \u0027best three days in the festival\u0027s history\u0027Click to followThe Independent CultureCamp Bestival cancelled: Music festival forced to close due to bad weather“Devastated” Camp Bestival organisers have shut down its main arenas due to poor weather conditions.\u0026nbspAfter weeks of high temperatures in the UK, thunderstorms, high winds and rain caused many tents to flood, while all stages have been shut down due to health and safety concerns.\u0026nbspThe festival, held at Lulworth Castle in Dorset,\u0026nbspwas supposed to close tonight (29 July) by the Scottish band Simple Minds, who posted a statement addressing the issue on their Twitter account and linked to the festival’s own official update.Organisers said they have been advised by the safety team that arenas cannot be re-opened.

They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2014/04/11/16/world-in-pic-5.jpg","title":"theme parks children office slides rollercoaster pub adrenaline fun","story":"Created with Sketch.When most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health,\u0026nbspthere is nothing more precious than a place intended simply for funClick to followThe Independent OnlineRollercoasters invoke \u0027eustress\u0027, a kind of stress that is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it outThat moment at the top of a rollercoaster – after the slow upwards build, when you’re high above the treeline, dangling, stomach clenched, looking down – is hard to compare to anything else.

Then you hit the track again and your whole body is pumping along with your heart and you breathe and laugh – and want to go again. Or not. I can’t understand how some people hate rollercoasters\u0026nbsp– they are one of my favourite things in the entire world.Theme parks around the worldMeet famous characters and get your autograph book signedLego statues of all sizes - from miniland to life size modelsFerrari Land in Port Aventura, Spain, is famous for its fast rollercoastersOakwood is the only theme park in Wales and is home to Megafobia, voted the best ride in the UK and third best ride in the world by the Roller Coaster Club of Great Britain.

You can bet that any resort you visit will be filled with varied and never ending things to discover.Whether it’s the thrill-inducing rides, the milder water rides, the inventive “worlds” or the over-priced but delicious doughnut and ice-cream combos that draw you in, it’s hard to deny that theme parks offer something for everyone. They are often marketed as family attractions, something for the kids, but they are places that can captivate and entertain at any age.I don’t feel like I enjoy theme parks any less now that I’m an (admittedly childish) adult – if anything, I enjoy them more. My mood is not as volatile (kids have the tendency to be excited one moment and in a strop the next), I don’t tire at the end of the day and I can appreciate things I didn’t as a kid – the engineering that’s gone into creating a place (not that I know anything about engineering), the small details, the truly fine art and craftsmanship.And as far as I’m concerned theme parks are a work of art. As Bill Watterson, creator of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbes, believed, I couldn’t agree more that there is no such thing as high art and low art – rather creations that either speak to people or don’t. And what could speak to people more than a place created for the sole purpose of having fun?Kingda\u0026nbspKa, New Jersey, is the world’s tallest rollercoaster at 456ft – higher than Big BenAfter all, when most of us spend the majority of our weeks working, worrying about finances, trying to stay on top of life admin and suffering from increasingly poor mental health, there is nothing more precious than escapism. Our cities, towns and villages revolve around practicality – offices for working in, shops for buying things, gyms for exercising. Most of what surrounds us is mundane – it’s pretty wonderful in this context that we have places created for the sole purpose of having fun.But while some of the elements of enjoyment are\u0026nbspeasy to recognise as such – good food, fun family rides and the opportunity to take a picture with a lifesize Donald Duck – what is it that is so enticing about rollercoasters? By definition they should evoke sheer terror, yet we absolutely adore them\u0026nbspand queue for hours on end for the two-minute scare they provide.Richard Stephens, a senior lecturer in psychology at Keele University, argues that rollercoasters invoke a good kind of stress, called “eustress” – a word that has the same route as “euphoria”. This kind of stress is not bad for you – rather it is pleasurable and many of us actively seek it out.Eustress can also explain why we like being scared in other contexts, such as on ghost trains or in live action horror mazes. It makes sense that we must all have different ways of seeking this kind of good stress – which is why some people love rollercoasters and some people can’t stand them. I’m a big fan of rollercoasters but the thought of scuba ing absolutely terrifies me. But for others I imagine this is a “eustressful” experience.For the ultimate thrillseeker, the fastest rollercoaster in the world is currently the Formula Rossa at Ferrari World in Abu Dhabi, which reaches an eye-watering 150mph. The second fastest, Kingda Ka at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey, is also the world’s tallest,\u0026nbspat 456ft. To put that into some perspective, Big Ben in London stands shorter at 320ft.But Kingda Ka will not hold its title for long, as a new coaster, Skyscraper, is set to open in Florida in 2020 and will reach 500ft, plus have the steepest drop of any rollercoaster in the world.And lastly the longest rollercoaster, the Steel Dragon 2000, at Nagashima Spa Land in Japan is a whopping 8,133ft. It is the only existing rollercoaster to break the 8,000ft threshold, and it lasts for a whole four minutes.With rides becoming increasingly complex and impressive, it’s fascinating to see where things all started. The first commercial rollercoaster in the world, Switchback Railway, opened in 1884 in Coney Island, New York. It kickstarted the growth of attractions in the US, and before long Coney Island housed a few similar rides. The oldest acknowledged theme park was also located in the US:\u0026nbspSanta Claus Land opened in Indiana in 1935, and included many rides themed around the big\u0026nbspman in red.If you’d like a taste of an ancient theme park,\u0026nbspthe oldest\u0026nbspstill in operation can be found in Klampenborg, Denmark. Bakken opened in 1583 and has more than 150 attractions, including a wooden rollercoaster built in 1932. Denmark is also the home of Lego, and the original Legoland Park – so a heaven for theme park fans.In the UK we’ve also been breathing life into old theme parks, such as\u0026nbspDreamland\u0026nbspin Margate. First opened in 1880 and popular all the way through to the\u0026nbsp1990s, it was closed in 2003 and set to become a residential area. But after local residents campaigned to restore and open Dreamland instead, it was brought back and soon had a £25m\u0026nbsprevamp.It now has a concert venue, seaside pub and rooftop rum shack, and new rides are being introduced to sit alongside the restored vintage ones. According to its Wikipedia page, it’s intended to be a “working museum of vintage funfair rides”. And it’s changing the fortunes of the surrounding small seaside town in Kent.Another intriguing destination is an unexpected one. Nestled deep in the Italian woods, Ai Pioppi boasts a colourful range of rides – none of which are powered by electricity. Instead, riders push, pedal and swing – but we’re not talking playground-style attractions here\u0026nbspwe’re talking full-on Ferris wheels and rollercoasters. But perhaps even more impressive than the park’s eco-credentials is its founder, Bruno Ferrin, who has been building the park himself since the late 1960s. He started by adding a few slides to accompany his restaurant – and it grew from there.Around the world there are a whole host of niche theme parks – those interested can visit Hello Kitty’s castle in Japan, unearth mud at Diggerland\u0026nbspin various locations across the UK and US and view a host of farting and vomiting statues\u0026nbspat BonBon-Land in Zealand, Denmark.Of course, obscurities aside, you’re still guaranteed to have fun at your local attraction. And increasingly we’re seeing theme park culture enter\u0026nbspour day-to-day – less traditional workplaces are starting to install slides and ball pits and Penn State station in New York is considering adding a rollercoaster alongside it’s shops and subway platforms.It would do us all some good to get out the office and have some fun for the sake of fun –\u0026nbspor even better\u0026nbspwe could incorporate theme park rides and attractions into our daily lives.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It had seemed so obvious that the\u0026nbsptwo Alexs would\u0026nbspgo, and, despite Alex\u0026nbspscrabbling around to make-up - with £50,000 gleaming in his eyes - they were indeed dumped from the villa, leaving four couples - Josh and Kaz, Megan and Wes, Jack and Dani, and Paul and Laura, left ahead of the\u0026nbspLove Island\u0026nbspfinal.So who will go home with the £50,000 prize on Monday? Catch you tomorrow for what is sure to be an emotional final episode.This liveblog is now closedGood afternoon! Welcome to the Independent\u0027s Love Island liveblogIt\u0027s kind of nuts to think this is our penultimate blog documenting all the drama (because there has been SO MUCH)* that has taken place over the past two months.\u0026nbsp*SarcasmTonight is where we get to see the parents invade the villa and give their offspring some last-minute advice ahead of the live final on Monday night, where one couple will triumph and take home the £50,000 prizeBtw did everyone see the moment it KICKED OFF in the last episode when Josh put his foot in it?Anyway, that\u0027s about it from me until the penultimate episode kicks off tonight at 9pm. I have a feeling it\u0027s going to be an emotional one. See you then!Who do you think will be dumped from the villa tonight?Good evening! Are you ready to find out which couple will leave the island tonight?Here\u0027s a recap of what happened in last Friday\u0027s episode:With only two episodes of Love Island 2018 left, one can only image how gruelling the ITV2 producers will make them for our islanders.\u0026nbspSo it seems they decided to give them a break, sending the remaining couples on incredibly lavish dates.Megan and Wes got to go on a luxury boat ride, where the L-Bomb was dropped, again.\u0026nbspMeanwhile Kaz and Josh had a fairylight-lit dinner (I suppose candles were too dangerous with so much hairspray in the air), accompanied by a woman playing a white grand piano while a man danced in a hoop. Even Dr Alex and Alexandra made up after their acrimonious breakup.\u0026nbspBut, as only Love Island knows how, the happiness soon gave way for suspense. The sunny Spanish skies fast turned grey as the islanders found out their fate...\u0026nbspThe contestants had to vote for the couple that they wanted to put forward for eviction on Sunday (29 July) night. Tensions ran high, intense discussions about friendship and unconditional love were had, but choose they must.Fans seem convinced that it will be Alex and Alex who will leave the villa tonight, after presenter Caroline Flack\u0027s cryptic Instagram post... don\u0027t those silhouettes look familiar?\u0026nbspI\u0027m actually getting quite emotional thinking about the end of Love IslandI can\u0027t actually remember what my life was like before this liveblogWhile this series has been somewhat lacking in actual drama (the Australian version had real-life fights), it\u0027s not been without debate. Much of the conversation has centred around how the show promotes a very narrow view of what is attractive in our society.Some argue that it\u0027s actually a very accurate portrayal of how superficial modern dating has become - comprised of swiping left or right based on an immediate judgement of a profile picture.But then it\u0027s also been quite depressing to hear some of the islanders reveal their painful lack of knowledge on certain subjects, like basic human anatomy. Hey, remember that time Georgia didn\u0027t know what an earlobe was?Anyway, I digress. Back to tonight\u0027s episode. As fans will already know, we\u0027re going to see the parents arrive at the villa to bestow some much-needed wisdom to their offspring ahead of the live final on Monday.After texting in their choices, we are\u0026nbspleft with three couples up for eviction. Josh and Kaz, Dr Alex and Alexandra, Laura and Paul.\u0026nbspIt had seemed so obvious that the\u0026nbsptwo Alexs would\u0026nbspgo, but after scrabbling around to make-up - with £50,000 gleaming in their eyes - they may have clinched it.\u0026nbspThe Love Island final takes place on Monday 30 July at 9pmJack and DaniWes and MeganEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/06/24/11/remain-1_0.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/06/24/11/remain-1_0.jpg","title":"totnes brexit independent city state uk eu remain second referendum final say peoples vote","story":"Created with Sketch.Citizens of Devon town declare independence from UK in hope of staying in EUClick to followThe Independent OnlineHow the \u0027Independent City State of Totnes\u0027 will start the reformation of Brexit BritainThe declaration of independence is affixed to the Guildhall building with all the moral force of Martin Luther nailing his 95 Theses to the church door at Wittenberg.But not the physical force.\u0026nbspThe Guildhall is Grade I listed, the door in question dates to the 17th\u0026nbspcentury, and modern magistrates take a dim view of criminal damage.“It’s more Blu Tacking than nailing,” explains the man doing the affixing, Jonathan Cooper, lawyer, thinker, visionary leader of the movement for an Independent City State of Totnes.​Blu Tack does the job just as well as nails.To the bemusement of a pair of passing American tourists, the declaration remains stuck to the Guildhall door, in the form of the “Totnes Oath”: “We affirm our allegiance to the European Union and promise to abide by and promote the universal values upon which it is based…”Thus is revealed the document that will inspire not just an independent city state in what is currently a Devon town, but a veritable\u0026nbspreformation of Brexit Britain.Totnes will become as a city upon a hill (above the River Dart) a shining example to all.Other city states, says Mr Cooper, will start popping up all over Britain, all declaring independence from the UK, all insisting on their continued membership of the EU – and a second referendum.What Totnes has started, Plymouth will surely join and London will definitely imitate.\u0026nbspUlverston in Cumbria, says Mr Cooper, has already been in touch suggesting a similar venture and an alliance.Although Mr Cooper does also hint that he might not be entirely serious about his bright idea.He may even be seeking to inject such long-forgotten virtues as “levity” and “wit” into “all this Brexit chaos and misery”.This reformation, it seems, will be inspired less by the austere seriousness of Martin Luther and more by… um… Brutus of Troy, the last Duke of Burgundy and Passport to Pimlico.All of which can and will be explained.But first, let us pause to acknowledge, as everyone does, that this is a movement that could only be started in Totnes, a town of picturesque streets lined with independent shops, offering plenty of healing crystals but no Costa Coffee. (Local protest kept the brand out of the town in 2012.)It’s been called “the capital of New-Age chic”, “the most eccentric town in Britain”, a source of inspiration for artists, writers and therapists, and a cause of rage for at least one visiting rationalist who fulminated against a hotbed of “drop-in Tarot and meditation classes, art healing workshops and psycho-spiritual dance sessions”.And let us continue to pause, because the Totnes passports, which shall be issued to all who are willing to swear the Totnes Oath, are still at the printers.\u0026nbspSomeone spotted an error when they came off the press.This is a pity because Marian and Barry Skeffington have turned up in the hope of becoming the first senior citizens to have their own Totnes passports.Alerted by an early morning news item on Radio Devon, they hot-footed it to the Guildhall determined to be the first in the queue at the Totnes “passport office”\u0026nbsp(which in its current form is more bench than office).“I want mine to have the number one on it,” says Barry, a retired hotel general manager.\u0026nbsp“I have such pride in Totnes.”He and Marian are happy to wait.\u0026nbspWe have time to explain the roles of Brutus of Troy and Passport to Pimlico.Mr Cooper, 55, invites us to consider the Brutus Stone\u0026nbspin nearby Fore Street, and the writings of the monk Geoffrey of Monmouth in the far away 12th\u0026nbspcentury.People\u0027s Vote march - demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina

was, of course, the city state of Troy,” he begins.\u0026nbspAccording to Geoffrey of Monmouth, the wanderings of Brutus of Troy took him, after many adventures, to the River Dart, to a land inhabited only by abundant game and a small band of giants.Here Brutus stepped ashore and declared (while standing on the aforementioned stone): “Here I stand and here I rest, and this good town shall be called Totnes.”Brutus and his followers slew the giants, including their leader Gogmagog.\u0026nbspAnd on this now happy shore they created the second Troy that in due course became the nation named Britain, after Brutus.“We are the inheritors of Troy,” insists Mr Cooper, “and the marvellous thing about the EU is that it adopted our Trojan values\u0026nbsp(defined in the Totnes Oath as “compassion, endeavour, ingenuity, altruism, diligence, daring and a peace-loving commitment to the dignity of all sentient beings”).”But now, says Mr Cooper, Britain wishes to depart from Europe and its Trojan values, so to stay true to its roots, Totnes must remain in the EU by declaring its independence from the UK.And should Theresa May’s government refuse them their independence, the Totnesians will cite the precedent set by the 1949 film Passport to Pimlico, in which a plucky band of Londoners claimed to be in part of Burgundy, as granted by English King Edward IV to Duke Charles “The Rash”.There will be issues to resolve, none more vexing than question asked by Conservative district council leader John Tucker: “Will there be a soft border with Newton Abbot?”But Totnes is the town that slew the giants Gogmagog and Costa Coffee.With right, legal precedent and the spirit of British film comedy on their side, declares Mr Cooper, “Totnes will become a leading entity within the EU.\u0026nbspThe City State of Totnes will very quickly become a very prosperous world leader.”“How are we doing on the passports?” asks Barry hopefully.\u0026nbsp“Any word on the passports?”They’re still at the printers.In the Independent City State of Totnes, explains Mr Cooper, everyone will be listened to, not just the 37 per cent of the electorate\u0026nbspwho voted Leave (as opposed to backing Remain or abstaining).The town’s castle, adds his partner Kevin Childs, an art history lecturer, has the perfect circular shape for a people’s assembly.\u0026nbspThe Guildhall would become the headquarters of the executive.\u0026nbspThe town’s Conservative MP – and GP – Dr Sarah Wollaston, who has already called for a second EU referendum, will, they hope, accept their invitation to become the provisional government’s interim first minister,\u0026nbsp“so Totnes will also have the best healthcare system in the EU”.(When The Independent phoned, the woman in Dr Wollaston’s constituency office laughed.\u0026nbspThen she said the MP was in meetings.)The Totnes national anthem has yet to be composed, but will have “forward-looking” words.\u0026nbspThe city state’s flag has yet to be designed.\u0026nbspThey are also uncertain on whether to adopt the euro or keep the Totnes\u0026nbsppound\u0026nbsp(a local currency started by an eco-charity in 2007).But we know what the passports will look like because, hot off the adjusted presses, they have now arrived.\u0026nbspThey are, of course, in EU red and incorporate the image of Brutus of Troy, plus watermarks depicting a carrot\u0026nbsp(for organic farming), a computer – conceived of\u0026nbspby Totnesian Charles Babbage\u0026nbspin 1837 – and three healing crystals (obviously).\u0026nbspThe Totnes Oath is printed on the back cover.Clutching the first ever passports issued by the Independent City State of Totnes, Marian and Barry are delighted.“This is fun,” says Barry.\u0026nbsp“But I’m not particularly hot either way on Brexit.”Organic innkeeper Geetie Singh-Watson, next in the passport queue, is slightly more on message.“I want to stay in the EU,” says Ms Singh-Watson, of the Bull Inn, who is accompanied by her springer iel Artichoke.\u0026nbsp“This does seem an opportunity to question how we got to this point after a referendum full of false statements.“I swear allegiance to Europe.\u0026nbspAnd so does Artichoke!”There is similar enthusiasm on the high street, at Rhythm and Light (purveyor of “crystals, fossils, world music, instruments”).“I like the idea,” says Rhythm and Light owner Sandi Whale, “because of what it shows up – the lies and skulduggery that got us to Brexit.“It does rather highlight that the government is letting a right-wing cabal dictate to the rest of the country.“Totnes is so different,” she adds.\u0026nbsp“You feel you can do anything here.”But at Earth Food Love, Britain’s first zero-waste supermarket, a note of caution is sounded between the jars of organic puffed quinoa and the grind-your-own almond butter.“It’s amusing,” says Edward Judge, 21, the man behind the counter.\u0026nbsp“But there are not as many radicals here as you might think.”And if you really want to be over-serious, you could try quite a few objections to Mr Cooper’s City State of Totnes plan.For a start, Mr Cooper isn’t just any old lawyer.\u0026nbspHe is a human rights specialist with particular expertise in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.In Brexiteer demonology, that probably places Mr Cooper in first class on “the Brussels gravy train”, clutching a CV slightly worse than Satan’s.Although Mr Cooper doesn’t see it that way.“It is a fiction that lawyers get rich by exploiting EU human rights law,” he says.\u0026nbsp“In fact, if Britain left the EU, I would be richer, because there would be so many complications flowing from Brexit that I would get much more work.“The overwhelming majority of human rights barristers do large amounts of pro bono work,” he adds, “because we represent people who are not wealthy, but who genuinely need legal protection.”The so-called Thatcherite\u0026nbspeconomic miracle, he suggests, was more of an EU miracle resulting from Britain joining a single market now populated by 500 million people: “It only became controversial when they realised they couldn’t have the business model without the social justice model and protections for workers.”But enough about Mr Cooper.\u0026nbspWhat about Geoffrey of Monmouth?\u0026nbspHe didn’t just invent Brutus of Troy.\u0026nbspHe promoted the myth of King Arthur.\u0026nbspGeoffrey of Monmouth could plausibly be described as more fake news than Boris of Battlebus.Mr Cooper bristles, albeit not altogether seriously.“Where do we get the name Britain, if not from Brutus?\u0026nbspIf they are going to stoop to the level of challenging Geoffrey of Monmouth … We have got the Brutus Stone.\u0026nbspWhat more evidence do you need?”It is with some hesitation that The Independent reminds Mr Cooper that the town’s reputation for “crystal waving” – as one jaded local put it – has spawned the oft-repeated joke that Totnes is twinned with Narnia.“The only fantasy land is Brexit,” insists Mr Cooper.Totnes is twinned with Vire, France.\u0026nbspNot Narnia.\u0026nbspIt is accessed via the A38, not a wardrobe.Yet it has to be said that the key problem in establishing the Independent City State of Totnes may prove to be the independent minds of the citizens of Totnes.Visit for example, the fully immersive art installation that is Totnes’s internationally acclaimed Timehouse.\u0026nbspLie on the “flying carpet”\u0026nbspin the Cloud Nine room while watching a projection of Plan 9 from Outer Space.Then listen to Timehouse owner and creator Julie Lafferty.\u0026nbsp“It is fun to have an independent city state,” she says. “When we first created the Timehouse, I wanted to declare this slice of land the Territory of Aeons.“But when it comes to Brexit, I’m neutral.\u0026nbspI think of myself as Switzerland.”There is even more iniduality back on the high street, in the heavily bearded form of Sky, a 41-year-old “gravedigger and one-to-one enabler in mental health”.Women to lose ‘fundamental rights’ because of Brexit, warns reportGovernment admits plan to stockpile medicines if no-deal BrexitThe British people must be given a final say on the Brexit dealLeave, Remain, EU, UK, Independent City State of Totnes: whichever political form you choose, to Sky you are just “deciding what shape you want your chocolate teapot”.The whole debate, he suggests, is a ersion: “It’s all couched in capital, and anything couched in capital is slave to the banks.”But the faith of Mr Cooper remains unshakeable.“And Totnes will be leading the way.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to

attracted more than 300,000 signatures in support in the first 48 hours.Writing in The Sunday Times, Ms Rudd, a former energy secretary,\u0026nbspsaid: “Yes, we will leave the EU’s political institutions in March next year – we will no longer have MEPs or be members of the European Council.\u0026nbspBut disentangling regulatory and legal systems that have been entwined for more than 40 years will require delicate diplomacy.“Such an endeavour will not be straightforward. Anyone who claims it will is being as cavalier with people’s future as those who deny that the belching of fossil fuels into the atmosphere is warming the planet.“Just as we must listen to scientific warnings about the risks of manmade climate change, so we must listen to the businesses and economists warning that a chaotic Brexit will threaten our economy.”Theresa May has said voters should be “take reassurance and comfort” from\u0026nbspthe government’s no-deal planning, as details emerged over proposals to stockpile food, medicines and fuel in case supply chains are disrupted.More than 1.4m extra young people could vote in new Brexit referendumMP hits out at Labour members after losing no-confidence voteCan’t we, just for once, hear from some sensible Brexiteers?Students up and down the country support a second referendumHow the ‘Independent City State of Totnes’ hopes to stay in the EUUnder the plans, ministers are\u0026nbspconsidering drafting the army in to help deliver supplies to hard-to-reach areas\u0026nbspoutside of the southeast of England,\u0026nbspaccording to The Sunday Times.Supermarkets have already\u0026nbspdismissed suggestions that they stock up on\u0026nbspadequate food supplies\u0026nbspas “impractical”.The British Retail Consortium, the trade association,\u0026nbspsaid: “Retailers do not have the facilities to house stockpiled goods and, in the case of fresh produce, it is simply not possible to do so.“Our food supply chains are extremely fragile and this is yet further demonstration of the need for an agreement on the backstop to ensure frictionless trade is maintained after 29 March 2019.”Doctors have also warned that cancer patients could face potentially dangerous delays to their treatment if critical supplies of medical isotopes are held up at the border.Dr Jeanette Dickson, vice president of clinical oncology at the Royal College of Radiologists, said: “These medicines are like a burning fuse.\u0026nbsp“They start off with a certain amount of radioactivity and you have a set time to get them to hospital when they are still effective. If you delay them for a few hours, you begin to lose activity.”Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Health secretary Matt Hancock has said that ministers are looking at plans\u0026nbspto stockpile medical supplies, vaccinations and blood products.A Department of Health spokesman said: “The UK’s ability to import medical isotopes from Europe and the rest of the world will not be affected.”Earlier,\u0026nbspSir Michael Rawlins, the chair of the UK medicines regulator, said millions of diabetes patients could be “seriously disadvantaged” if supplies of insulin were disrupted.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/16/13/Scot-Mann-MP-1.jpg?width=1000\u0026amp;height=614\u0026amp;fit=bounds\u0026amp;format=pjpg\u0026amp;auto=webp\u0026amp;quality=70\u0026amp;crop=16:9,offset-y0.5  on= tap:gallery-lightbox-6406121  role= photo  tabindex= 0  layout= fill  alt=   srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/16/13/Scot-Mann-MP-1.jpg","title":"brexit referendum final say petition vote eu remain leave theresa may","story":"Created with Sketch.Politicians backing campaign say British people deserve right to have say on final terms of dealClick to followIndy PoliticsFinal Say: More than 350,000 people back The Independent\u0027s campaign for a vote on government\u0027s Brexit dealHave you backed our campaign?

This vote must include an option for an exit from Brexit.Vote Leave chief leaks \u0027fake news\u0027 report on misuse of dataOdds on second referendum and no-deal Brexit tumbleThis is what day one of a no-deal Brexit could look like“I congratulate The Independent for joining this campaign. It’s both a brave and correct move.”Labour MP David Lammy, who has called for a second referendum since 2016, said: “The Independent’s new push for a referendum on the final Brexit deal sits, with other similar campaigns, on the right side of history.“Allowing the public to choose whether we remain in the EU – or indeed choose, in full knowledge, to become poorer, less sovereign and diplomatically neutered – is the only democratic solution to this political nightmare.”Former Conservative attorney general Dominic Grieve, Labour’s Chuka Umunna, Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, campaigner Gina Miller and ex-Labour spin doctor Alastair Campbell have also backed the campaign.Theresa May has urged voters not to worry about Brexit, despite her government setting out plans to stockpile food, blood and medicine in case it goes badly.She said people should take “reassurance and comfort” from news of the plans, to be implemented if the UK crashes out of the EU without an agreement in March.But as a no-deal Brexit began to look more likely, Mr Blair took to Twitter to give his support to the campaign.He said: “33m+ people voted in the EU referendum wanting a better country, not to be poorer, not to put further pressure on our already stretched health service, not for job losses or to stockpile food and medicines. It should be your #Finalsay.”Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Have you backed our campaign? Click here to sign our petition.Regardless of how you voted in the Brexit referendum, you deserve a say on the final deal.That’s why we’re launching the Final Say campaign, to win for the British people the right to make that all-important decision on the Brexit deal. Come what may in the months ahead, we maintain our commitment to our readers to retain balance and present many different points of view. But on this subject we believe a referendum on the final deal is right.We believe there are three reasons:1. The people, on both sides of the debate, are losing faith with the current process. From Theresa May to parliament as a whole, a chaotic approach has delivered infighting, resignations and party politics, but little progress on the key issues that people care about.2. The people on both sides should have the chance to finish what they started. With reality coming into focus, it’s only natural to check this future is what people really want. After years of negotiations behind closed doors, the people must not be shut out of the final decision.3. The people – on both sides – know so much more now than we did in 2016. The campaigns – again, on both sides – were flawed and clouded by misinformation. Many myths have been exposed. Now we must check there is support for the facts of Brexit.A full account of The Independent’s view is available here.In 2016, the people were given their say on the principle of whether to stay in the EU or leave. Now the facts are becoming clearer, it’s time for the people to have the final say on the real deal – before it’s too late.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/08/10/rtr3s0i0-1.jpg","title":"first time buyers loan deposit bank government young people hfi","story":"Created with Sketch.Housing and Finance Institute puts forward initiatives to increase number of homeowners\u0026nbspClick to followIndy PoliticsFirst-time buyers often struggle to get onto the housing ladderYoung people who are struggling to buy their first home should be given loans by the government for the deposit, a report said.\u0026nbspThe Housing and Finance Institute (HFI) put forward initiatives to increase the number of homeowners by one million by 2035.\u0026nbspThe organisation has suggested that the government cover the cost of a deposit and much like the student loan system, the money should be repaid as a proportion of the recipient’s salary.\u0026nbspFirst time buyers paying double to get on property ladder in LondonThe best UK cities for first-time buyers revealedHope for first-time buyers with a low depositGovernment accused of failing to act on housing crisisAgain, like the student loan system, the deposit loan would have a low interest rate, the repayment would only start above a certain salary threshold and it would be written off after 40 years.\u0026nbspNatalie Elphicke, chief executive of the HFI and a former adviser to the government on housing, told : “The 15-year experiment of expanding the private rented sector on a huge scale has failed.“It has left too many people facing exorbitant rents for poor-quality homes, with severe detrimental effects on their living standards and future opportunities.

It argues that Brexit marks a natural point at which to reform the UK’s immigration system.ID cards cost £2m to decommissionID cards go up in flames in first step to tackle ‘database state’ID cards are a controversial topic, however, with opponents arguing that they infringe civil liberties.Tony Blair’s government brought in a £5bn ID card scheme in 2006 but\u0026nbspit was\u0026nbspscrapped by the Conservative-Liberal Democrat\u0026nbspcoalition just four years later.David Goodhart, Policy Exchange’s head of demography, immigration and integration, said he believed\u0026nbspID cards were necessary – but acknowledged\u0026nbspthat people would be wary and said\u0026nbspID cards should be phased in voluntarily.\u0026nbsp“We strongly recommend reopening the debate about ID management to reassure people that we know who is in the country, for how long, and what their entitlements are,” said Mr Goodhart.Windrush scandal will happen again if government persists with immigration plans“A proper national ID system would have prevented the harassment of the Windrush victims,” he added.Other ideas put forward by Policy Exchange include reducing the cost of citizenship application fees and an amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in the UK for 10 years or more.Such policies would de-incentivise illegal immigration, said\u0026nbspMr Goodhart.Your guide to immigration rhetoric The media have been impartial in their coverage of the \u0027immigration crisis\u0027Welcome to England: The Eastern European migrants were so determined to take advantage of the relaxed border controls that nothing, yes absolutely nothing, would act as a deterrent The Mail rightly points out the \u0027mass movement\u0027.

He added: “Illegal immigration is not only unfair on legal immigrants who wait their turn in the queue and the employers and businesses who play (and pay) by the rules\u0026nbspit also fosters a twilight world of criminality, dependence and exploitation in which modern slavery flourishes.“Combating illegal immigration should be overtly linked to minimum wage enforcement, private landlord licensing and action against modern slavery.“While a general amnesty for the estimated 500,000 illegal residents here would send the wrong signal, some form of regularisation should also be considered for those who have been here for more than 10 years, who are now part\u0026nbspof their communities with ties to the UK and often become the focus of grassroots campaigns.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/23/17/steve-bannon.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/23/17/steve-bannon.jpg","title":"steve bannon movement ukip brexit","story":"Created with Sketch.Party pledges\u0026nbspto share experience with the new groupClick to followIndy PoliticsUkip to team up in \u0027unholy alliance\u0027 with Steve Bannon\u0027s new far right European movementUkip has pledged to work with\u0026nbspSteve Bannon’s new European alt-right movement, forging what critics have branded an “unholy alliance” to bring down the EU and fuel populism across the continent.Mr Bannon, a former investment banker who founded the website Breitbart, has pledged to bolster the continent’s far right with a new foundation called The Movement that would dole out resources to eurosceptics and anti-EU populists.The former chief strategist of Donald Trump has rattled Brussels after stating his intention to\u0026nbspcreate a “supergroup” in the European parliament after next’s year’s EU elections, with extreme right-wingers taking as many as a third of the legislature’s seats.Though Ukip MEPs will not be able to participate directly in the parliament because of Brexit, a spokesperson pledged that the party would share experience with Mr Bannon’s project to give it a leg up, stating they expected the group to have a “large impact” on European politics and hoped for “a new army of eurosceptic MEPs”.Mr Bannon’s move into Europe also appears set to have an impact on the dynamics of Brexit talks, with one source close to Brexit negotiations telling The Independent that Brussels has been spooked by the alt-right project.As a result, EU officials are increasingly resistant to calls for the Article 50 negotiating period to be extended, so as to avoid eurosceptic Britain participating in the European parliament elections scheduled for next May.The EU is said to fear that such an outcome would see Ukip, which won the 2014 European elections in the UK, return to the parliament and bolster the numbers of Mr Bannon’s new anti-EU group.Ukip teaming up with fascist-in-chief Steve Bannon is an unholy alliance of racist charlatans across the Channel“They really don’t want to see Farage back with Bannon for the sake of a few extra weeks,” one source close to talks said.Layla Moran, a Liberal Democrat MP and supporter of the pro-EU Best for Britain campaign told The Independent the British eurosceptic party were “desperately trying to make themselves relevant again” by joining forces with Mr Bannon.“Ukip teaming up with fascist-in-chief Steve Bannon is an unholy alliance of racist charlatans across the Channel,” she said.“Having been forgotten over the last two years, Ukip are desperately trying to make themselves relevant again. But they’ve got their work cut out for them: nobody wants to hear the verbal sewage coming out of a group whose only claim to fame is their rent-a-gob ex-leader.“Now they want dark elements of the far right in America to help plot their nasty agenda. The dangers stirred up by this kind of right-wing populism are obvious, but terrifying for the many people who fear history might be repeating itself.”A spokesperson for Ukip’s EFDD group told The Independent: “Steve Bannon certainly seems to offer a different perspective, and with his experience of American politics he could exert a large impact on the European scene which is currently going through quite a change.“Ukip MEPs wish to leave the EU in March 2019 and have no desire to return to its facade of democracy in Brussels. The MEPs will however be happy to share their experience with a new army of eurosceptic MEPs from a liberated UK.”Far-right, eurosceptic\u0026nbspand right-wing populist parties are currently scattered across a wide range of groups in the European parliament, including the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR), Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy (EFDD), and Europe of Nations and Freedom (ENF) – as well as parties with no group.\u0026nbspSuch parties are expected to make gains at EU level next year, as they have done in national elections since the last European parliament contest. Finding agreement between them to join a single group could be difficult, however, with many parties extremely cautious of their domestic image and loathe to ally with foreign parties that are seen as more extreme at home.\u0026nbspSome of the parties might turn their noses up at uniting under the leadership of an American organisation, too, as many have an anti-American political outlook.Brexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

None of this is easy to doClick to followThe Independent OnlineFrom cricketing legend to prime minister of Pakistan, the rise of Imran KhanAfter more than two decades of political campaigning, much of it spent in the political wilderness, Imran Khan will finally become Prime Minister of Pakistan. Along the way, as his ex-wife Jemima Khan\u0026nbspnoted on Twitter, he endured “humiliations, hurdles and sacrifices”. Now, the former cricket legend and philanthropist could become one of the most powerful civilian leaders the country has known.Older readers will of course be familiar with him. After playing cricket for Oxford while he studied politics, philosophy and economics at Keble College, Khan became one of the best known Pakistanis in Britain. He figured prominently in tabloids for his social life, was often spotted at exclusive private members clubs like Annabel’s and Tramp.\u0026nbspHe\u0026nbspbefriended Mick Jagger, Sting and Goldie Hawn while being on nodding terms with Prince Charles and other royals. He married Jemima Goldsmith, the journalist and filmmaker sister of Zac, and invited Princess Diana to Pakistan.For Pakistanis, Khan was one of the few people who did them proud. Winning the Cricket World Cup in 1992 was a rare moment when Pakistan distinguished itself internationally. Pakistanis had grown weary of being principally depicted as a Third World basket case beset by social problems where women, minorities and the poor were treated appallingly. At times when boorish and condescending English cricketers like Ian Botham described Pakistan as “a place to send your mother-in-law”, Khan confronted that racism publicly.Pakistanis craved a confident, good-looking spokesman and the former cricketer could play the part. It’s one of the reasons why many voted for him.“I believe Oxford educated Imran Khan can stand toe to toe with world leaders and make a strong case for Pakistan,” wrote Haroon, a Pakistani singer and one of many celebrities, including cricketers, singers and actors who backed him.\u0026nbspBut he was also supported by a bewildering array of people from religious conservative backgrounds, wealthy businessmen, grafters from the middle classes, taxi drivers and factory workers.Khan is many things to many people. Central to his appeal is that he has not been in power before. It was common to hear his supporters say: “We’ve tried the others”,\u0026nbspreferring to the parties of former prime ministers Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, “let’s try him this time”.\u0026nbspFor people alarmed at endemic levels of corruption, Khan represents a rare, honest and financially “clean” leader valiantly battling against an entrenched venal order. For religious conservatives and nationalists, he soothes feelings of injured pride and rouses their spirits.There are people whose support he should be embarrassed by. Sara Taseer, a Singapore-based entrepreneur, declared herself appalled by the sight of poor Baluch women lining up to vote. “Love seeing this turnout of women,” she tweeted, “but then I think would I allow these ladies to make a decision even about what be cooking in my kitchen today? And these ladies will decide on the future of the nation. Scary thought.”And there are supporters he should stay clear of. Asad Umar, Khan’s finance minister to be, posted photos of himself courting the support of Fazlur Rehman Khalil, someone whose name is on a US\u0026nbspterror watchlist.Khan’s rhetoric is often studded with references to the plight of the poor and the ravages of the elite. “A country shouldn’t be measured by how its wealthiest live,” he said in his first speech after the election, “but by how its poorest people are treated.” Critics say that message is at odds with the composition of his party, which is dominated by some of the wealthiest people in Pakistani politics. Many of Khan’s candidates this time around were also drawn from conventional old parties or military regimes, undermining the claim that their election will herald a “new Pakistan”.There are contradictions people notice in Khan\u0027s own pronouncements. When I interviewed him for The Independent, he came across as thoughtful, polite, serious and even good-humoured. On the campaign trail, however, he was seen as boastful and arrogant – making crude jibes against his opponents, taunting voters who support his rivals as “donkeys”, and denouncing liberals as “bloodthirsty”. He has forcefully denounced terrorism, and yet has been accused of being soft on the Taliban. Khan was a critic of Pakistan’s blasphemy laws and has defended religious minorities, but more recently vowed to protect the laws and accused his opponents of being part of a foreign plot to undermine it.When I first came to Pakistan to report for The Independent, Khan was a fierce critic of General Pervez Musharraf’s military rule. I saw him on the streets supporting an independent judiciary, interviewed him the night before he was arrested for defying emergency rule, heard him speak out against attacks on the press, enforced disappearances, civilian casualties in military offensives, and covered his protests against CIA drone strikes. Those experiences do not easily reconcile with the image of him as a mere shill for the Pakistan army.As prime minister, Khan will want to be the most powerful leader in the country. That distinction has usually belonged to the head of the army, which has ruled the country directly for three decades and wielded its clout backstage for the rest. It will be interesting to see how he negotiates these structural tensions. Some of the areas of dispute between Khan and the army have faded: drone strikes are rare, military operations he opposed are a thing of the past, and the US-led, Pakistan-backed “war on terror” is all but over.So, how will Khan rule? As a crusader against corruption and champion of the poor, or as an angry demagogue? Will he strengthen Pakistan’s feeble civilian institutions or disappear into the shadows of the military? Can he unite all the different Pakistanis he appealed to this afternoon, or will he seek to deepen the dangerous political isions that this election has revealed? Will Pakistan pursue peace with its neighbours, or will old modes of chest-beating belligerence endure?Only time will tell. The speech he made this afternoon pleasantly surprised many: he vowed to lift the country out of poverty to combat corruption – starting by hold himself and his own cabinet accountable he said he would educate the more than 25 million children out of school and he said he would protect the rights of minorities and women. None of this is easy to do. There are strong reasons to believe Khan won’t be able to. But it would be good to see him try.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Why has there been an upsurge in violence?At the heart of the latest escalation is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests that have taken place at the border fence between Gaza and Israel. \u0026nbspSince 30 March, hundreds of thousands of Gazans have marched each week on the heavily fortified border\u0026nbspdemanding the right to return to lands they fled and were forced from after the 1948 war, which resulted in the formation of Israel.Palestinians, who have suffered for over a decade under a crippling blockade, have said they are\u0026nbsppeacefully demonstrating during the Great March of Return marches, which is their right. But Israel has accused Hamas, the proscribed militant group that runs the enclave, of encouraging protesters to be violent towards their soldiers, to cut the border fence and to launch raids inside Israel.\u0026nbspThe Israeli military has responded with live fire, leaving more than 140 Palestinians dead, and many more with life changing injuries, in moves described by the UN General Assembly as excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate”.\u0026nbspAt the same time, protesters say, in frustration, they have taken to launching burning kites and balloons laden with incendiary devices across the border, setting alight to over 2,600 hectares of Israeli farmland and causing hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage.\u0026nbspThe Israeli army, that said its citizens near to Gaza are in danger, subsequently tightened an 11-year-old blockade on the strip, closing Kerem Shalom, the sole goods crossing between Israel and Gaza, and strangling Gaza’s fishing zones to just three nautical miles, a third of what it was before the protests. Israel said earlier this week that it would allow fuel and gas to be transferred via Kerem Shalom, and widen the fishing lanes, partially lifting the restrictions, should a shaky ceasefire hold.\u0026nbspNeither side to date will back down, saying their respective responses are fair and legitimate. This has created a cycle of violence that has reached boiling in the last week, with warnings from the UN that a war could break out.Q. Why is the UN fearful there could be another war? \u0026nbspOn Friday, 20 July, Israeli Staff Sergeant Aviv Levi, 21, was killed by what the Israeli army called a “violent raid” during the protests.\u0026nbspIt marked the first time an Israeli soldier was killed by Palestinian gunfire near Gaza since the last war in 2014 and so crossed a definitive red line. Israel said that gunmen had shot at and lobbed grenades at its soldiers. It responded by bombarding Gaza with tank and air fire, and said its forces struck 60 “military sites” run by Hamas.Four Palestinians were killed that day. Palestinian health officials said that at least one was a civilian. Earlier in the month, there was the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza militants and Israel since the 2014 war - largely due to the border protests.\u0026nbspEgypt has intervened several times enforcing ceasefires which keep being broken.\u0026nbspGazans protest as US embassy moves to Jerusalem – in picturesPalestinian mourners carry the dead body of Mukhtar Ebu Hamas, 25, killed by Israeli forces in Gaza on 14 MayA Palestinian woman flashes a victory sign during a protest near the border fence Israeli soldiers guard on top of a watch tower along the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinian demonstrators react to fired tear gasPalestinian demonstrators run for coverUS President\u0027s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner arrive for the controversial inauguration of the US embassy in Jerusalem.

He said it was “imperative” both Israelis and Palestinians abide by the ceasefire.On Monday,\u0026nbspZeid Ra\u0027ad Al Hussein, the UN’s human rights chief, called for an investigation into Israel’s actions at the border calling the most recent killings “shocking”. He said it was also vital to address the root causes of the Gaza demonstrations which would continue, as living conditions under Israel’s blockade are “grossly inadequate”.\u0026nbspPalestinians in Gaza, including the armed factions, say the Israeli security forces have used live ammunition against peaceful protesters, and launched devastating airstrikes on the strip, killing dozens of people. They said that Israel has also exacerbated a humanitarian and economic crisis within the enclave by adding the new restrictions.\u0026nbspIsrael maintains Hamas, that it regards as a terrorist group, has incited violence and endangered the lives of Israelis near the border. It says the fires caused by the burning kites have caused significant damage to farm land.Q. Who are the protagonists?The main protagonists are Israel and its army, and the myriad armed factions within Gaza, that answer to a central operations room that is ostensibly led by the militant arm of Hamas – called the Qassem Brigades. Within that are vastly different factions, with anything ranging from small far-left Marxist armed groups like the National Resistance Brigades to Islamic jihad’s al-Quds Brigade.\u0026nbspQ. What is at stake?For this region, everything. In the last war more than 2,200 Palestinians, and 73 Israelis, were killed. Gaza took several years to recover and still has not been fully rebuilt. More fundamentally is the moribund Middle East peace process, which is arguably dragging into its eighth decade. A new devastating war would only put another nail in its coffin.\u0026nbspEgypt, that has long held a position as mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict, has reportedly intervened multiple times in the past few weeks to broker a ceasefire. Last week\u0026nbspHamas said it once again stepped in and brokered a truce but it keeps being broken.\u0026nbspMost recently on Wednesday, Israel fired a barrage of tank and artillery shells at what it identified as military targets within Gaza, after one of its soldiers was injured during an earlier cross-border exchange of fire. Three Palestinians were killed during the tank fire,\u0026nbspHamas\u0026nbspconfirmed the dead were members of its group.\u0026nbspQ. What is going to happen now?Both sides of the conflict, as well as civilians, have repeatedly expressed an interest in stopping the current escalation from tumbling into a full-blown war. Further deaths will only worsen the situation.Q. But if neither side wants war why does the violence continue?\u0026nbspHamas is in a tricky position. Gaza is experiencing one of the most severe economic crises in its recent history. There are many reasons, including the Israeli blockade, new sanctions from the Palestinian Authority which is dominated by Hamas’ secular political rival Fatah and a massive shortfall in International aid funding.\u0026nbspIn a bid to force Hamas to relinquish power over Gaza, last April the PA ordered early retirement for nearly a third of its 60,000 Gaza employees as well as restrictions on electricity access to Gaza. In May it slashed salaries to its civil servants in the enclave by at least 20 percent, piling on more pressure.\u0026nbspCash-strapped Hamas, that once relied on taxing goods smuggled through tunnels to Egypt, has also been unable to pay its own 40,000 employees in full.Meanwhile the United Nation’s refugee agency UNRWA said it is suffering from an “unprecedented” £164 million funding shortfall, after the US said it was slashing more than 80 percent of its \u0026nbspfunding to the agency. This has only exacerbated\u0026nbspthe problems. This week UNRWA\u0026nbspannounced it was getting rid of\u0026nbsp250 jobs in the Palestinian Territories, including more than 100 in Gaza.\u0026nbspThe 1.8 million residents\u0026nbspof Gaza, who are\u0026nbspalready suffering from one of the highest jobless rates in the world, cannot sustain further devastation and many are increasingly frustrated with their own leaders.\u0026nbspMembers of Hamas’s Palestinian political rivals in Gaza have told The Independent that Hamas wants the focus of Gazans\u0027 anger to be directed towards Israel, which it regards as an occupier, rather than at local government and themselves.\u0026nbspAnd therefore, the protests at the border cannot stop.\u0026nbspIsrael, meanwhile, is facing a potential war at its northern border as well as its frontier with Gaza. \u0026nbspOver the last months, Israel has been increasingly concerned by Iran’s attempts to build permanent military infrastructure near Israel in Syria, where Tehran is backing Syrian President Assad and the rebels. Iran and its allied forces have fired into Israel.\u0026nbspMembers of the Israeli army and government have told The Independent they have no interest in fighting a war on two fronts. But at the same time Israel is facing pressure from its own people to stop the burning kites and violence at the border.\u0026nbspIt all depends on whether the Egyptian-brokered truces can hold.\u0026nbspGreat March of ReturnEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

(Image: )David Goodhart, Policy Exchange\u0027s head of demography, immigration and integrationThe scheme will operate online and via a smartphone app and registration will cost no more than about \u0026pound75.The EU identity scheme should be seen as a trial run for a scheme that could include UK citizens too, said the Policy Exchange report.This could be the subject of a separate report, but it is worth noting how relatively simple and unobtrusive such a system could be.The system should not require a physical ID card, let alone the obligation to carry one as was the case in the second world war.The authors suggest it could initially be rolled out to UK citizens on a voluntary basis, with more people persuaded to take them up as they observed the benefits of easy access to services.It would also make it much harder for illegal immigrants to remain in limbo, said the report.That would in turn remove the need for the kind of hostile environment policy that caused the scandal of legal Caribbean immigrants known as the Windrush Generation facing deportation and losing their rights to jobs, housing and services after decades living in Britain, because they could not prove they were entitled to be here.Co-author David Goodhart, Policy Exchange\u0027s head of demography, immigration and integration, commented: We strongly recommend reopening the debate about ID management to reassure people that we know who is in the country, for how long, and what their entitlements are.A proper national ID system would have prevented the harassment of the Windrush victims.The report also calls for a more decisive process to remove failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants, though there should be an amnesty to let those who have been in the UK illegally for more than 10 years and who are now part of their communities to regularise their status.The authors recommend more investment in border control including lorry scanners and staff.They want rail and ferry operators to be required to provide more advance information about passengers, as airlines already do.A single authority should be in charge of coastline border security, and Britain should work more closely with Irish authorities to stop the UK-Ireland Common Travel Area being exploited for illegal entry.Meanwhile, to reduce passport queues, they suggest Britain introduces a US-style of pre-travel Electronic System for Travel Authorisation, to enable non-UK citizens to use electronic e-gates at borders, and make it quicker for low risk groups to enter the country.The authors recommend more investment in border control including lorry scanners and staff. (Image: Policy Exchange)Mr Goodhart said: If people believe that their national borders are well-managed they are likely to worry less about the numbers crossing them.The coming end of free movement is an ideal time to invest more in a smoother, mainly digital border system.The UK is slipping behind the most innovative countries such as the US, Australia and Singapore.A Home Office spokesman said: We are pursuing an ambitious programme of reform at the border as well as investing in new capability to improve passenger experience.The scheme will operate online and via a smartphone app. (Image: )Examples of this include e-Passport gates and motion detection technology which benefit passengers and improve security.Border Force invested \u0026pound63.5million in new technology and capability in 2017-18 and \u0026pound90.4million in the two previous years combined.Decisions on the future immigration system will be based on evidence.This is why we have asked the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to advise on the economic and social impacts of the UK\u0027s exit from the EU and also on how the UK\u0027s immigration system should be aligned with a modern industrial strategy."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/139/590x/Theresa-May-995974.jpg","title":"brexits news theresa may brexit plan richard kellawa philip davies","story":"Senior activists fear wipe-out at the next election if there is not a good deal.

Things are said.” While one Cabinet minister remarks: “It is not a great surprise. He’s been saying no all along.”This minister’s view is that it is now “up to the member states” what happens next.But they aren’t likely to come to the rescue of May’s customs plan. I understand just a handful of them are interested in it.Most of them don’t want to let the UK collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf or to have to collect tariffs for the UK ­themselves. The sheer bureaucratic complexity of the scheme doesn’t make it appealing.So, what happens next? Well, as May has told the Brexit Inner Cabinet, Barnier’s real aim is to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.His calculation is that faced with a choice between a customs union and no deal, Britain will buckle.The attraction to the EU of keeping the UK in a customs union is that it will keep the pattern of trade much the same as it is now.There won’t be any free trade deals that cut the cost of, say, Australian wine and reduce European producers’ share of the UK market.But Barnier is making a dangerous assumption in thinking Britain will accept a customs union in the end.May has repeatedly said that she doesn’t want one. In the unlikely event of her changing her mind on this, more ­ministers would resign from her Cabinet (two are already on the verge of quitting, according to their colleagues) and more letters would go in demanding a vote of no confidence in her.It is hard to imagine her surviving this. Brexiteers would argue that if the EU won’t accept May’s proposal, the UK should turn to the “max fac” customs plan.This doesn’t eliminate all checks at the border, but uses technology to hugely reduce them and speed things up.The EU, though, will say that this doesn’t solve the Irish ­border problem and match what May committed herself to in December. It was this worry which led to her rejecting “max fac” in the first place.Some ministers are now beginning to whisper about whether, in these circumstances, some separate arrangements for Northern Ireland would be so terrible. But May herself would never go for this.One Cabinet minister warns a separate deal for Northern Ireland would bring down the Government, “I can’t see how the DUP would accept that and we can’t govern without them”.This minister says that May has made a “bold and fair offer to the EU” and if they won’t work from that “we’re not going to end up with a deal with them”.There is a strong sense among ministers that the UK can’t carry on with Barnier saying no and the Government offering up concession after concession. In the words of one, “we shouldn’t sell the soul of the nation to have a deal with the EU”.Is no-deal the most likely outcome, then? Well, not yet.Some in Government believe they can reverse the EU’s threat — pointing out that if there is no deal there will be a hard border in Ireland. They hope this message might make the EU more amenable either to May’s customs plan or to a “max fac”-style solution.What’s for certain is that May’s meeting with other EU leaders in September is ­shaping up to be crucial. But May must make sure she goes to that meeting with a plan B.If Merkel, Macron and Co want more and more ­concessions on Chequers, May must simply change course and ­propose a Canada-style free trade deal.She should tell EU leaders — and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar in particular — that the choice is between that and no deal, with all it would mean for the Irish border.But MPs who are back in their ­constituencies  are telling me that they are getting  even more stick  than they  expected about her proposals.One  Tory predicts that time spent  in the constituency will “put a fire underneath MPs before they  come back, rather than calming them down”.THERESA MAY’S fundamental flaw as a politician is on display again. She is simply not very good at selling things.This was her problem in the General Election campaign and it is her problem now as she tries to persuade a sceptical public of the merits of her Brexit plan.Her trip to the North East this week was a case in point. Here was a chance to try to sell the deal directly to voters. But May failed to take it.She didn’t come with anything new to say, she didn’t ask voters to put themselves in her shoes or make a charismatic case for it. As one Cabinet minister laments: “She’s uncomfortable with ­people, including her own ­colleagues.”But May needs to sell this plan. If she cannot turn public opinion on it around – at the moment only 12 per cent of voters think it would be good for Britain – then she won’t be able to get it through Parliament.As May goes on her summer hols, she should be thinking about a big address to the nation in September where she makes the case for her plan. It could be her last best chance to save it.THE most alarming thing about Labour’s anti-Semitism scandal is that the extent of concern across the Jewish community about how Labour is dealing with the issue hasn’t been enough to make the party change course.It is now hard not to conclude that Labour’s refusal to simply accept the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism is worryingly sinister.It is tempting to put this all down to the Brexit effect, and that is – obviously – part of it.But what is striking is how volatile politics is right across the Western world. In the EU, the new populist Italian government will announce its budget in September, which could cause major problems in the eurozone.In Germany, a regional election could further destabilise the coalition there.While Spanish politics is about to be riled by it becoming the new centre of the migrant crisis.Meanwhile in America, August promises to be the most dramatic month yet in the presidency of Donald Trump  as his own lawyer appears to have turned on him.None of these situations is exactly the same.But there is a common root to this volatility: The aftermath of the financial crisis and the challenges posed by the fact it has never been easier to try to move from the poor world to the rich world.Until Western governments come up with answers to these questions, politics will be extremely volatile.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She is the same age as me. But that’s where the similarities stop. In fact physically, the only thing that is similar about our ­bodies are our toenails.But when I see pictures of her I don’t feel bad about myself or envious (on the contrary, I feel only admiration) because I know I have not put in any effort to look like that.I like cake too much, and I like going out with friends, having a drink, cooking and eating. And I am more than happy with my lot.The problem is, though, that a lot of women DO feel bad about themselves when they look at photos of beautiful women.They compare themselves and feel they don’t measure up that they are lacking or worthless. This is especially an issue for young girls.Talking about body image this week, Loose Women presenter Nadia Sawalha said she blames herself for her teenage daughter’s body issues.She thinks 15-year-old Maddie has developed insecurities by growing up with Nadia talking about her own.“She grew up around me being negative about my body and she picked that up by osmosis,” she said.Unfortunately, it’s true that girls are influenced by the way their mothers feel about their bodies.But the reality is it’s not just our mum’s body image that is informing ours.It’s the airbrushed adverts and the photos that have been photoshopped into flawlessness on social media, offering impossible standards for us to try to live up to.It’s the enhanced physiques of the Kardashians and the women on Love Island setting impossible standards of “femininity”.The bottom line is that women are constantly sexualised and judged on their appearance, so it’s all too easy for women to fall prey to the pursuit of a “perfection” that doesn’t exist.When “perfect” can only be attained with surgery and extreme dieting, or starvation, you are setting yourself up to feel inadequate and bad about yourself.Even when some women look like they’ve achieved “perfection”, they still feel bad about themselves.Megan on Love Island is a good example.She is absolutely stunning but still lacks confidence — the one key thing surgery and dieting can’t necessarily give you.The most important thing you can give to any young girl — or boy — is that belief in yourself and who you are, and the certainty that your personality is just as important as the way you look.The question is, how do you achieve this?One thing I always tried to emphasise to my daughter when she was young was that it’s not just your skin that people are going to judge you on.I never worried about my weight and never said I felt fat — even if I had put on a few pounds.I also emphasised that happiness is not about looks.It is about how you feel, and about the friendship, fun and laughter you have in life.Laughter and personality are infectious.People don’t want to spend time with people obsessed about their looks and their weight.They want to be around people who are interesting, fun and dynamic.Have you seen that film, I Feel Pretty? It stars Amy Schumer, whose character is fuller figured, wears big pants and is always on a diet.Then she bangs her head and wakes up thinking — and acting as if — she is drop-dead gorgeous.As a result, doors start opening for her and she can have any man she wants.It’s just a film, but it rings true: Confidence comes from within.So much about confidence comes down to attitude.If you are constantly thinking about your flaws you forget your positives.So next time you find yourself pointing out your flabby bits, force yourself to find a positive.Forget “perfect”, accept your flaws and focus instead on dressing for your body shape.If you don’t know how to, then ask a sales assistant — that is the beauty of going into a shop rather than shopping online.And there’s nothing wrong with a few props. I’m not a fan of cosmetic surgery but if a padded bra and fake tan make you feel better about yourself, then go for it.That way you’ll have more time to get on and enjoy life, rather than fretting that you don’t look like J-Lo.THE saga of Tini Owens, 68, who has been trying for several years to end her 40-year marriage to 80-year-old mushroom farmer Hugh, took a depressing turn when she lost her long-running legal battle to divorce her husband.In short, she insists their relationship has broken down but Mr Owens refuses to agree to the split.Despite her certainty that it’s over, and the fact they are now living in separate houses, five Supreme Court judges waved away Mrs Owens’ pleas to let her end the union.They ruled she must stay married – because Mrs Owens has failed to establish that her marriage had irretrievably broken down, as required by law.How farcical.We do not live in the Middle East, or the middle ages, and we are not owned by our husbands.So why is she being forced to stay married to him?And what kind of man wants to force his wife to stay married to him?They didn’t deny the conclusions drawn by people at the time that they would rectify the shocking pay-gap between the actors and give Claire a £100k cheque as back-pay.But now that the dust has settled, guess what? It turns out the back-pay bit was just a rumour and no such thing has happened.Given that they pledged at the time that there will be no gender pay parity for the new cast, that sounds like flawed logic.I ADMIRE Louise Redknapp for saying she “lost her identity” during her 19-year marriage to ex-husband Jamie.The former Eternal singer, 43, talked about the fallout of putting her successful career on hold to raise sons Charley, 14 and Beau, nine.I guess what partly happened is that Louise found her identity again after being in the 2016 series of Strictly, followed by the show Cabaret.Having put her life on hold, which would build resentment in even the most giving individual, Louise had a chance to rediscover herself.Either Jamie didn’t like that, or he felt he couldn’t be part of her new life.It’s such a good reminder of the importance of hanging on to your own identity in a marriage.Even if you are the stay-at-home parent, it’s important to find a way not to be the “Wife of” or “Husband of” someone else.And not just to prevent your spouse from losing sight of the person they fell in love with.The real issue is that you can forget who you are yourself.A lot of this comes back to shared parental responsibility.The more equality there is with parenting, the more space there is for both parents to retain their individuality.Here’s some unsolicited advice for any new parents out there.Even if all you think you want to do now is look after your kids, try to find a little bit of space that’s just for you.Hang on to the things that made you you before you had kids and you’ll be doing your marriage a huge favour.But what’s as important as having separate interests and experiences in a relationship is that you grow together.It’s good to take separate paths but make sure you’ve got a shared one too.You’re welcome!\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBRITAIN’S first “legal” red light district, in Holbeck, Leeds, was a great idea – on paper.It was created four years ago with the aim of stopping sex trafficking and violence, and combatting sexually transmitted infections by regulating the sex trade.The problem is, it hasn’t worked.In fact it’s caused a surge in sex and drug-taking in parks and woods – sometimes in view of children.Not only that but the number of reported rapes and sex assaults in the red light district doubled since it launched.There is no perfect solution for the world’s oldest profession.But perhaps we need to start considering a way to create safe and regulated brothels since street-walking is never going to be safe.I WAS sickened to read about the man who “rescued” an 18-year-old British au pair in Naples who had just been raped by two men.Allegedly, he offered to help her but then said, “It’s my turn now”, before raping her again.What kind of despicable human being “rescues” someone only to attack them?In my view, if he is found guilty, whatever sentence he gets should be doubled.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

There was a private event in his constituency which had nothing to do with his role as Minister for Housing.“I put it on his diary card to be helpful though it really wasn’t my res­p­onsibility to sort things like that. Next day he was raging. He had called my line manager in a fit at 10pm. He was furious — he couldn’t find the address.“The door number was wrong, everything was a mess and he had hit the roof about his diary management. My line manager, his private secretary, knew the error had been made by another PA and it wasn’t my fault.“We tried to explain but he had no time to listen. He said, ‘I don’t care. There is an issue with diary management in this office’. I was made to feel small and undervalued. He seemed to be avoiding talking to me which created an awkward dynamic.“He had some kind of personal issue with me. In the end the other PA admitted it was her error. Even then, there was not a single apology or acceptance he made me doubt my capabilities and my place in that office. I felt bullied. I was distraught. I felt wrecked by the way he made me feel.“His inability to accept when he is wrong is a nasty characteristic. It’s typical Dominic Raab behaviour.”Rebecca said she was not the only one in the office treated cruelly by Mr Raab, who replaced David Davis as Brexit Secretary on the same day she was given her P45.She said: “There were days he would call other staff and scream at them down the phone. It reduced one of my colleagues to tears. He called her later to say, ‘Sorry, I was overworked and over-stressed’.“If he didn’t like the format of a briefing, he would just say, ‘I’m not going to read it’. I felt it was impossible to work with him. The way he spoke to others was short and sharp. He’d cut people off.”Rebecca’s claims are not the first time the Esher and Walton MP has faced a storm over his attitude.In 2011, he branded some feminists “obnoxious bigots”, claiming men were getting such a “raw deal” that it was time they “started burning their briefs”. His remarks put him at loggerheads with Prime Minister Theresa May.Rebecca went on: “He was notorious for going to the gym every day for one hour and 15 minutes. I had to fit that in no matter what. There were times when it was just not workable and I’d say, ‘I’m really sorry, I’ve had to cut five minutes off the gym because you have a really important meeting.“His reaction would be, ‘No, you don’t have authority over the diary. You ask me first and then I make that change’. I found it patronising. His responses were just rude.“His tone was aggressive. You’d be mid-sentence and he’d say, ‘Stop. I don’t want to hear from you’. Whatever your status, there is no need to be like that with anyone.”Dad-of-two Mr Raab also sometimes refused to walk to the Commons from his office.Rebecca said: “It was just a seven-minute walk, but he requested the daily use of the ministerial car.”She claims there were ­simmering tensions with the staff of other ministers in the department. She said: “If I asked Dominic to take on a commitment that others couldn’t, he’d say, ‘They all seem to think this is one big happy family. It’s not. It’s me and it’s them’. He was referring to the other junior ministers. That remark stands out.”Rebecca was suspended in April after a newspaper sting revealed she had met men via the sugar daddy website SeekingArrangement. At the time Mr Raab went on radio to dismiss the scandal as a “storm in a teacup”.Then Rebecca was dismissed for breaches of conduct — a humiliating end to a career which began when she joined the civil service at 16.Rebecca is now setting off on a round-the-world voyage. She said: “I’m excited for a new beginning. This chapter in my life has closed, and I’m ready for the next.”A source close to Mr Raab said last night: “Rebecca was dismissed according to an independent process. This is an attempt to cash in by smearing with false and malicious claims.”Rishi Sunak, who worked with Mr Raab as a junior housing minister, said: “Dom was a great colleague, supportive and collegiate. I have tremendous respect for him.”A Housing Ministry spokesman said: “We do not recognise these claims and they do not reflect the department’s experience — including those who worked directly with the minister in his private office.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The changes – which will be announced today following an eight-week consultation — will give “clear and consistent” guidelines and stop a potential boom of bogus claims for badges.Under the new rules, the badge will be extended to people who cannot undertake a journey without there being a risk of serious harm to their health or safety or that of any other person, such as young kids with autism.Others who will become eligible include those who cannot make a journey without suffering considerable psychological distress or have considerable difficulty walking.Minister for disabled people Sarah Newton said: “It is absolutely right that disabled people are able to go about their daily life without worrying how they will get from one place to another.“We’re taking an important step forward in ensuring people with hidden disabilities get the support they need to live independently.”National Autistic Society boss Jane Harris said the move would make a massive difference to the lives of many people.She said: “Just leaving the house is a challenge for many…involving overwhelming anxiety about plans going wrong.“The possibility of not being able to find a parking space near where you’re going can mean you can’t contemplate leaving the house at all. A Blue Badge will be a lifeline and prevent a life of isolation.”Sally Copley, of the Alzheimer’s Society, said: “This will be an absolute game changer for people living with dementia.It will bring great benefit to many of the 850,000 people currently living with dementia in the UK.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think some of the cast are from around the outskirts of Ascot.”Another local, who claimed to have met the cast at Ascot races, described them as “quite rough”.They added: “After meeting them [it seemed like a] very poor representation of Ascot - I hope the house prices dont decline.”On the Ascot People Facebook group, a community forum which has 10,000 members, many commented after spotting the crew filming on the local green and around supermarkets in the town.One person wrote: “One wrote: “I can see house prices dropping….”Another commented: “Dear God, could it get any worse?”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004193191431.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"new mums should turn off the tv and have more cuddles with their babies to bring up healthy kids minister says","story":"Andrea Leadsom, who quit the Tory leadership race by implying Theresa May wasnt the right choice to be PM as she wasnt a mum, is launching proposals to boost care for young babies.The Leader of the Commons claimed that more new mums needed to bond physically with their babies by talking to them more, hugging them, smiling and stroking them.And that parents shouldnt rely on the TV to keep them occupied all the time.She told the Sunday Times as part of plans to set up advice sessions for new mums: Don’t let the television be the constant childminder.She added: Take time to turn the TV off and sit with your baby in the bouncer, look at your baby, count baby’s toes, stroke your baby at bathtime.Those are the things that develop the baby’s brain.Her comments come two years after she dramatically quit the Tory leadership race by comments she made implying Theresa May wasnt the right fit to be PM as she wasnt a mother.The mum-of-three said she had a stake in the future of Britain - but Mrs May has been unable to have kids with her husband Philip.Ms Leadsom previously set up the Parent Infant Partnership Charity to give psychological support to new families.The PM has asked her to help lead a committee to transform Sure Start centres and different types of support - including counselling for couples and help for mums with post-natal depression.“I recall when my baby cried, I would cry, she said.

Exchange claimed extending a documentation programme from 3.6million Europeans living here to all British citizens could help tackle illegal immigration and would avoid another Windrush scandal.David Goodhart, the think tank’s head of demography, immigration and integration, said the scheme could be widened to Britons, at first on a voluntary basis.He said a lack of ID cards, the UK’s open labour market and the English language made Britain a magnet for illegal immigrants.He added: “We strongly recommend reopening the debate about ID management to reassure people that we know who is in the country, for how long, and what their entitlements are.“A proper national ID system would have prevented the harassment of the Windrush victims.”But he also urged ministers not to water down the Government’s so called “hostile environment” policy – branding it simply border control.The Border Audit: A Post-Windrush Review also called for more border patrol boats and a more “decisive” removals process, that gets people out before they can judicially review their cases.An amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in the UK for 10 years or more is also suggested.Home Secretary Sajid Javid has already announced that EU citizens already living in Britain must pay £65 and join a registration scheme if they want to stay in the UK post December 2020.A £5 billion national identity card scheme was introduced by the last Labour government in 2006.A bill to scrap it was the first legislation introduced by Theresa May when she became home secretary in 2010.A Home Office spokesman said:

It is fraught with difficulty because it is not compulsory to work on your day off.“The rail industry is run on a wing and a prayer with an expectation that people will work overtime on their days off. The solution is very simple. We need more drivers.”An Aslef spokesman added: “On any given day train services are being run voluntarily.”Bruce Williamson, of the campaign group RailFuture, said: “There is a shortage of drivers. Whatever the networks say, we know this is the case.“We pay the highest rail fares in Europe and we certainly dont get the best service for that.“If you are cutting human resources to the bone then that will have an impact.”A spokesman for the Rail Delivery Group, which speaks for rail operators, denied there was a driver shortage, adding: “Operators continually recruit for drivers and work with trade unions to discuss employment terms so that they can meet the demands of the timetable.”A spokesman for Northern said: “We have more drivers than we need to run a full timetable in normal circumstances.”A spokesman for Govia Thameslink Railway, which runs Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern, said it was looking at bringing Sundays into the working week.He added:”Drivers working rest days and overtime is standard practice in the industry and is used to cover training requirements, sickness and other, day-to-day issues.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NC-TrevKav-Graphic-e1532909200770.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"were on brink of political anarchy so we need a clean brexit to stop eu vultures","story":"The Tories are tearing themselves apart over an irreversible democratic vote to leave the European Union.

Forget about a second referendum.Leave campaign mastermind Dominic Cummings is right to warn Brexit would win an even bigger majority in the current atmosphere of rank betrayal.Remainers bleat about Brexit dividing the nation for generations to come. In fact, the wounds can ONLY be healed by a successful, clean-cut Brexit.We will NOT sink back into the Dark Ages, cut off from the world, adrift in the North Sea with no friends.More important, a successful Brexit is the ONLY way the Tories will beat off the threat from Labour and Ukip.Under a bolder, more dynamic leader — sooner rather than later — Britain will re-establish itself as a flourishing, tax-competitive trading nation.It is what Brussels, and Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxists, fear above all.Before we know it, we will be into our stride, making our own trade deals and wondering what all this fuss was about.From our new vantage point we will also be looking back at the EU — a bickering, cash-strapped political catastrophe that is already unravelling at huge cost to its member states.Among which, thank goodness, we will no longer be counted.Three Jewish newspapers blasted his refusal to accept the international definition of anti-Semitism.

I thought they were just jealous I had a best friend who made me feel so good.It spiralled out of control so fast that months after my first appointment at child and adolescent mental health services my heart nearly stopped and I was admitted to a mental health hospital where I spent the next year of my life recovering.It was the hardest year of my life: revisiting past experiences, learning to talk about my feelings and learning to accept that I needed help.After that year in hospital, I had developed a handbook of coping mechanisms - including learning to talk about how I felt, challenging myself around food, and getting rid of all emotions.But my biggest frustration was that people still thought your anorexia must be completely gone if you were a healthy weight.That is not the reality. There is so much more to recovery than gaining physical weight.Recovery isn\u0027t always a straight line either. You have to learn what triggers to watch out for, and to be aware if it gets tough again.As we entered in to 2016 I was feeling positive about life. I barely thought about my anorexia and I certainly didn\u0027t let her dictate what I did.But after my grandma passed away, anorexia used it as a reason to seduce me. She pulled me in when I was feeling weak and grieving, sucking me closer and closer. After four months of battling with this relentless voice in my head I reached out for help. I got an appointment at my local mental health trust, but because I wasn\u0027t underweight there was nothing they could do for me.My story isn\u0027t unique. In fact there are countless people who get turned away for not being \"thin\" enough, or not fitting a specific criteria. It isn\u0027t right or fair that this is still happening - and it means people with eating disorders aren\u0027t getting the treatment they need to prevent them getting worse.After I came through my relapse I decided that I needed to help others, so I wrote a book, Stand Tall Little Girl, and I began doing talks about mental health."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-kylie-theresa-imran_4373657.jpg?20180727230734 ","title":"zara tindall reveals she had a second miscarriage","story":"That pregnancy had been announced publicly just a month earlier, as is generally the rule for descendants of the Queen.She said: \"We had to tell everyone and it\u0027s like, everyone knows - that\u0027s the hardest bit.\"That\u0027s why I think a lot of people don\u0027t talk about it because [a miscarriage] can happen early enough or it\u0027s only your group of friends and your family that know.\" She said the first miscarriage had been a case of \"nature not working\", adding: \"In our case, it was something that was really rare it was nature saying, \u0027this one\u0027s not right\u0027, which your body does a lot, I think\".She added: \"Because it\u0027s so personal to each family and every case is different, you can never compare what\u0027s happened or the feelings that people have gone through or the trauma.\"Every case is different so I think it\u0027s something that people don\u0027t think you want to talk about.\"The Tindalls have two daughters, Mia, four, and Lena, who was born in June."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-emmerson-mnangagwa_4373561.jpg?20180727210230 ","title":"zimbabwe election president mnangagwas promises are questioned by opposition leader","story":"Zimbabwe\u0027s president has plenty to gain from a convincing victory in terms of political legitimacy and the prospect of investment - but the leader of the largest opposition party, the MDC Alliance, does not buy this transformation.Speaking to Sky News, 40-year-old Nelson Chamisa told me: \"Now he is saying that Zimbabwe is open for business.

The Prime Minister has been warned by her own constituency chairman that she must not concede any further ground to the EU. Seven chairmen of Cabinet ministers’ Conservative associations today said they either oppose the plans in their current form or would withdraw their support if Mrs May offered any further concessions to Brussels. Richard Kellaway, the chairman of Mrs May’s Maidenhead Conservative association, said: “If it were to be diluted it would ultimately not be acceptable”. Lib Dem MP and Foreign Affairs spokesperson Christine Jardine warned that Brexit could be determined by Tory internal party fighting. She said: “Yet again we are hearing about internal party fighting that could determine the position of the Prime Minister. In the interests of the country, we must demand better.  “As long as the Tories are dominated by these massive internal divisions they simply cannot be trusted to do the right thing.”  It came as former Home Secretary Amber Rudd hit out with a vicious attack comparing Brexiteers in her own party to climate change deniers.  Trade Secretary Liam Fox famously claimed a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU would be one of the easiest in human history. But Ms Rudd wrote Brexit will not be straightforward, adding: Anyone who claims it will is being as cavalier with people\u0027s future as those who deny that the belching of fossil fuels into the atmosphere is warming the planet.  Just as we must listen to scientific warnings about the risks of manmade climate change, so we must listen to the businesses and economists warning a chaotic Brexit will threaten our economy. Meanwhile ex-Chancellor George Osborne warned the Tories are politically screwed if they do not reconnect with modern Britain. In an GQ interview the Hard Remainer claimed the 2016 referendum was a vote for hybrid membership with the EU - risking the fury of Brexiteers. He added Tory Leave-backers are being found out as they try and put off the actual effects of leaving for years to come. The growing Tory row came as Mrs May was also warned by Italy’s deputy Prime Minister to take a hard line with the EU over Brexit negotiations or risk being cheated.  Right-wing populist Matteo Salvini said Mrs May should be prepared to walk away without a deal, adding: “On some principles there is no need to be flexible and you should not go backwards.” Her white paper sparked the resignation of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit Secretary David Davis. Some Tories have backed it but warned it should be a line in the sand - not a starting point for negotiations.

Imre Marton, 33, is so scared he lives like a recluse. He covers the windows of his home with film and thick black \u0026shycurtains so no one can see in. And his ordeal goes on despite his tormentor Charlie Howells being behind bars for a second time because she has \u0026shysuggested she has accomplices ready to help her and his “days are numbered”. Imre said: “I never feel safe. I know she won’t stop and this is never going to end. I am living in fear, always looking over my shoulder. I am sure that one day she will kill me. It’s the end goal for her. Her mission is for us to die together,” Imre’s nightmare began in 2012 when Howells, 24, first boarded his No32 bus in Oxfordshire. She began memorising his schedules. Her bizarre \u0026shybehaviour \u0026shyincluded standing just inches behind him so she could sniff him.  After she declared her love for Imre and he rejected her, Howells began \u0026shybombarding him with thousands of \u0026shymessages – \u0026shysometimes up to 500 a day. They included proposals, suggesting they tie the knot on a bus, and claims she had found his home address. Imre reported her and after four years of \u0026shytorment she got two years in May 2016. He spoke to the Sunday People after the case and in November 2017 took part in BBC documentary My Stalker and Me to help raise awareness of the issue. But his appearance re-ignited Howells’s campaign and she messaged him on Facebook to say: “You are the biggest fool ever, going on TV saying you wear a stab vest.  Well now Charlie knows where not to stab you… You thought your life was in danger then, there are many people out to get you now. I’d watch my back if I was you, you have been warned!!!!” Earlier this month Howells was jailed again for three years at Oxford crown court and given a ten-year restraining order. Imre, who left the city in January but is too scared to say where he is, said: “I take no comfort in her getting three years. “It just gives her more time to plan what she is going to do next – and that terrifies me.” Recalling how the campaign started, he said: “I’d feel her breath on me. She was like a ninja, she would \u0026shyappear from nowhere. She was always there.” After his rejection, Howells began turning up in shops and cafes Imre was visiting. On the bus she played One Direction songs and handed him notes.  Police gave Howells a \u0026shywarning but she found Imre on Facebook. He was forced to delete his account and apply for a transfer out of the city centre. Howells found him again and in August 2014 he won a two-year \u0026shyrestraining order – \u0026shybanning her from the city, his route and any contact. She ignored it. Imre said: “To avoid her, I cut my bus shifts and began working as a bouncer but she found me, getting my number from a driver who didn’t know how dangerous she was. She called every minute of the day.” Imre called 101 or 999 every time but her stalking campaign escalated. In 2015 Howells first said she was going to kill him – running a finger across her throat as she made the threat. Terrifingly, in April that year, Imre was with a colleague when Howells threw water in his face which he feared was acid. He said: “I felt lucky it was only water but it made me realise how easy it was for her to harm me.” In August, with Howells screaming “like an animal” at him, he called police again. She was remanded in custody and Imre secured a two-year restraining order. Howells was then twice convicted of breaching her restraining order and jailed in June 2015 for eight weeks. After persistently ignoring the order, she got two years in May 2016. The order was extended to five years.  But even with Howells behind bars, Imre was not safe. The first message he got was from a “friend” of hers, who Imre believes was a fake account. She continued to declare her love for him when she was released in August last year. Despite Imre blocking Howells, she kept creating new accounts. After he \u0026shyappeared in the documentary, her messages took an even more sinister turn. Chillingly, Howells told Imre: “If I can’t have you, no one else will.” She also told him on the bus and in the street that they were “going to die together”. The stalking escalated and in January Howells, of Shrivenham, Oxon, was held again after turning up at a bus stop and shouting and screaming at him. Police found she had a blade. Imre said: “I felt scared. I was told she was saying she is going to stab me in the neck and she had a knife.” He took a lower-paid job, which he does not wish to reveal, and left Oxford. He did not go to court on July 5 to see her locked up again. Imre said: “Even though she is behind bars again, I am still in constant fear. Everywhere I look, I think of her. She’s ruined my life.” Howells got three years after admitting breaching a restraining order, intimidating a witness and possessing a bladed article. But Imre said the term “is not long enough” and his own life is now more like serving a sentence.

Jenna Langston, 33, spotted the infant in the baking hot car and raced to help him by forcing open the boat and then opening the doors from the inside. The little boy was soaked in sweat and had been left alone in the car for at least half an hour before Jenna arrived on the scene at the Asda store in Barnes Hill. Emergency services rushed to the supermarket and the baby was taken to hospital. Jenna, who works as a care manager, was at the store to buy her favourite egg custards when she saw the baby, believed to be just three months old, in the back of the car.   She told Birmingham Live : I saw a guard standing by a black car and initially thought: \u0027I hope no-one\u0027s left a dog in there.\u0027  I had already heard a tannoy announcement giving a registration plate while I was inside the store and quite a bit of time had passed since then. But a guard said a baby was inside. I dropped my shopping and ran over to the car. I said the baby needed to come out straight away - it was 31C. But the guard said they couldn\u0027t break in because it would be classed as breaking and entering. I said I didn\u0027t care and I was going to get the baby out. The guard said: \u0027We can\u0027t help you do that. I could lose my job.\u0027 All the doors were locked and none of the windows were open. I forced the boot and threw bags and everything else out to get access to the baby. I got myself into the boot and put my top half over the back seat. He was dripping with sweat - his babygrow was like it had been through the washing machine. I opened the doors to let some air in and someone else asked if I wanted to sit in their car with the baby as it had air conditioning. Then the police and paramedics arrived. I handed the baby over to the ambulance crew. They said he seemed fine but they had to take him to hospital. There was still no sign of the car driver - it had been around 50 minutes by now. Then she appeared, walking slowly back to her car.

Golden sands stretching miles into the distance, sunshine glinting off the bright blue sea, the lights and bustle of a thriving coastal city 100ft below. It could easily be a spectacular view of one of Florida’s famous beachfronts. But this is our very own Miami - Bournemouth. With more than \u0026pound100million of investment ploughed into the resort in recent years, it’s a title that’s far from ridiculous. But while new, upmarket hotels have been built, along with a multi-million pound entertainment complex and infrastructure improvements across the seafront, Bournemouth has lost none of the charm and appeal that makes a British seaside holiday so endlessly appealing. Beach huts line the seafront, with locals and tourists alike soaking up the sunshine and atmosphere.  David and Diana Cox are visiting from Kettering, Northants and rent their beach hut, every summer, for \u0026pound170 a week. “I’ve been coming here for more than 20 years,” says David, 79, a retired enginer. “It’s a truly fabulous place. There is sea and sun, a diverse population – the good, gritty stuff that makes Britain great. “We come to swim in the sea and eat grilled fish and watch a pretty world roll by. The shops aren’t too shabby, either.” His 72-year-old wife, Diana, who used to work for Sainsbury’s, agrees. “Bournemouth is a proper little idyll. There’s something here for everybody – it’s just posh enough but it’s also just working class enough.” From Scarborough to Blackpool, and Weymouth to Bournemouth, the UK has a proud tradition of working-class seaside resorts that, frankly, knocks the socks and sandals of our European rivals.  The food is – these days, finally – better, the loos are cleaner and the beer is definitely colder. What’s not to like? Oh, and let’s not forget, at last we also have the weather. This on-off heatwave has, despite the short-lived weekend dip (don’t worry, August 1 puts us right back on the heatwave track), left us matching Miami’s temperatures too. Bournemouth’s long and generous beach – the most photographed in the UK – is only part of the draw. There are two historic piers to explore: Bournemouth Pier has become a playground for adrenaline-fuelled adventures with a zip-wire running from pier to shore and an indoor high wire and climbing centre Boscombe Pier is less white-knuckle affair offering a charming musical trail featuring giant chimes and mini golf with edible golf balls that drop into the sea on the final hole and feed the fish.  Psychiatric nurse Margaret Butler, 56, owns her beach hut and lives locally, and says she’s here “to swim, in Britain’s best weather”. She adds: “All of us are better people, I think, when we’re beside the seaside – the sounds, the views, the smell of it all. And Britain is under-rated as a holiday destination. Why? We are brilliant. We are a kind and generous people with a fabulous coastline and a properly decent spirit.” Something the almost 7 million visitors last year surely agreed with. This summer seaside influx is a British tradition, people flocking to the cooler temperatures and simple pleasures of the seaside. Tourism is booming across the whole of the UK with 40 million foreign visitors expected this year – a record figure. Tourist promotion agency VisitBritain has predicted that overseas trips to the UK will increase 6% to 39.7 million, with spending up by 14% to \u0026pound25billion a year. Britons are also holidaying at home in record numbers. Tourism is now worth \u0026pound127bn annually to the economy.  The UK has become a cheaper place to visit for tourists from overseas, following the fall in the value of the pound since the Brexit vote. However, during the first six months of last year there were a record 23.1 million overseas visits to the UK – up 8% on the same period in 2016 – and the figures for July last year topped four million for the first time, with only a slightly smaller number of visits made during August. Britain’s beaches have also attracted more staycationers and, with temperatures predicted, next month, to beat 2003’s record 38.5C, why even consider the hassle of foreign travel. Back on Bournemouth’s beach, Natalie Walford, 24, Fii (CORR) Smith, 23, and Lauren Sturgiss, also 23, are probably, the youngest people on the beach. Natalie, who is down from Brixton, London, says: “This is the best place in the world. Who would argue?” Certainly not Terry Keenan, 68, a dedicated Mirror reader. There is a copy of today’s paper on the floor of his beach hut. He is here with his family: his daughter Johanna, son-in-law Tim, both 37 and his grandchildren, Sebastian, six, and Zara, four . Tim and co are from Hampshire but Terry lives here. “Bournemouth is free-thinking but wild and, yes, just free.” "},{"url":null,"title":"boy leaves sweet note delivery","story":"NewsGenius boy leaves sweet note and gesture for his delivery driver so he doesn\u0027t miss his packageSultan\u0027s note and gesture shows he is wise beyond his years - and people have even suggested he should be the one in charge of Brexit negotiationsShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByJack Aitchison21:10, 29 JUL 2018Updated21:12, 29 JUL 2018NewsIt\u0027s a lovely gestureGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailGetting a delivery can be stressful.

The three dresses were created by designer Kate Tabor and took her over three weeks to make, using 20 metres of wetsuit material and 12 litres of foam.  Tabor took inspiration from the structural designs of Alexander McQueen and renowned haute-couturier Iris Van Herpen in creating the lip-smacking gowns.  The Couture creations were commissioned to celebrate the launch of Costa Coffee’s new Whipped Milk, which gives iced coffee drinks like the Iced Flat White and Cold Brew a silky mouth-feel while topping them with an elegant meringue-like appearance.  Kate Tabor, designer said: “Each dress is bespoke from a flirty minidress to an edgy asymmetric design and a classic, full-length bridal number all were inspired by the texture of Whipped Milk and the way it is poured. “I’ve created innovative costumes for everyone from David Bowie to The Chemical Brothers, but I’ve never designed anything as challenging or unique as Costa Coffee’s Whipped Milk Couture.” Designer Kate, who has created awe-inspiring costumes for music videos for the likes of Katy Perry and Kylie Minogue, began the process by sketching designs, then experimenting with delicate foams ahead of crafting robust neoprene shells, which supported the overall structure of the dresses. The painstaking application process took three hours per gown. The Whipped Milk creations mark the reinvention of Costa Coffee’s Iced Flat White and Iced Cappuccino drinks this summer.  The addition of Whipped Milk, an aerated skimmed milk foam topping, also forms the finishing flourish on summer menu items such as refreshing Cold Brew and in Costa Coffee’s new range of Milk Whips.

The Malaysian government has repeatedly been accused of holding back information - but hopes the final report into the tragedy will draw a line under it.  But the 150 page document may not provide any tangible answers about what happened to the plane , or the 239 people on board.  MH370 vanished four years ago on March 8, 2014, while on its way to Beijing, and the mysteries remains unsolved. It is one of the most perplexing incidents the aviation world has ever seen, but extensive searches have proved fruitless.  The government has, however, promised not to hold back, delete or edit anything from the report. Minister Anthony Loke said: Every word recorded by the investigation team will be tabled in this report. We are committed to the transparency of this report. It will be tabled fully, without any editing, additions, or redactions. In May, the country called off a privately-funded underwater search for the aircraft, which covered 112,000 square kilometres in the southern Indian Ocean. The only confirmed traces of the Boeing 777 aircraft have been three wing fragments washed up on Indian Ocean coasts. It was the second major search after Australia, China and Malaysia ended a $200million search across an area of 120,000 square kilometres last year.  But although the report due to be released tomorrow is the final one, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamed says he would consider resuming the search if new clues came to light. The plane left Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am local time. The final voice communication from the cockpit came less than an hour after takeoff:Good night Malaysian three seven zero. But the plane stopped communicating with ground control, deviating from its planned route two hours after take off, according to data from military radar. It abruptly left its planned route and turned back towards Malaysia, but dropped off the ground off course somewhere around the Indian Ocean.  Bizarrely, there were no reports of bad weather or distress calls. Aircraft communications had purposely been disabled earlier in the flight and although a signal was received, it did not contain information about where it was. Around 12 hours after contact was lost, teams from Singapore, Vietnam and Malaysia began searching in the waters near Vietnam, but they had no real idea where to start. FBI and Interpol flew in to help and 40 ships worked around the clock, with 34 aircrafts flying during daylight hours. An underwater search began on May 4, 2014 - 79 days after it went missing - but it still gave no answers as to what had happened.  Then, 327 days after the disappearance, Malaysia officially declared it an accident. The first fragment of the plane - a piece of wing - was found in July 2015 on Reunion Island, thousands of miles from Kuala Lumpur. The search resumed in October 2015 but the investigation was constantly hampered by bad weather.  In March 2016, a report still yielded no answers and families spent a total of $145million on conducting a private search. In four years of searching, the only confirmed traces of the Boeing 777 aircraft have been three wing fragments washed up on Indian Ocean coasts: in Madagascar, R\u0026eacuteunion Island , and Tanzania. Theories include the suggestion that the whole plane, including the captain, fell unconscious and the plane ran on auto-pilot before crashing into the sea.

Jenny Clough, 32, and her son Jack, five, were in the Pen Cob restaurant in Pwllheli, Wales, when she claims another customer told her to leave. The mum-of-one arrived at the pub at around 2pm on Monday, July 23, and shortly afterwards Jack became overwhelmed. The pair, who are from Manchester, were enjoying visiting family in Llanaelhaearn during the first week of the summer holidays.  Miss Clough, an administrator for the NHS, told the Daily Post : “Jack was just making a bit of noise and it hadn’t gone on for longer than 30 to 60 seconds when a man walked over and said we should leave.  “I explained that Jack is autistic and I asked him to just give me a minute to calm him down but he responded by saying it wasn’t his f***ing problem and said he was trying to have a nice meal with his wife.  “I couldn’t believe it was happening, nothing like this has ever happened before. “He was looking at Jack and speaking about him like he was nothing, it was very upsetting. “I know my son and I knew by the noise he was making that it wasn’t going to be a full on tantrum, I knew I could calm him down. “If it had been going on for 10 minutes I might understand but it was 60 seconds at most.” Miss Clough said she became even more defensive over her son when the man said that his wife had “one of them at home”.  “I was sobbing by this point,” she said. “I didn’t swear but I told him I thought he was a horrible man. I felt he was bullying me and my son, he was just glaring at us” “Not one member of staff said anything,” she added. Miss Clough says she contacted the Wetherspoons after the incident and spoke to the manager who apologised. “I accept their apology. I have no problem with the staff members at all”, she said.  “I’ve been to this Wetherspoons before and the staff have always been lovely. “My problem is with this individual, who was actually sitting five or six tables away from us anyway. “I understand that he is entitled to have a nice meal with his wife but Wetherspoons is family friendly - there were other children there making just as much noise. “I’ve never sobbed like that or been that emotional in my life. “It took me a long time to get to the point where I didn’t care what people thought and this has set me back.

The car they were travelling in burst a tyre and crashed into a tree on a family trip during Eid last month. Their brother Zuhran, 10, also suffered serious internal injuries in the crash.  Their parents and sister followed in a separate car just two miles behind and arrived at the scene just minutes after the vehicle spun out of control on their journey between Lahore and Kamalia.

Paying tribute to the boys, who both attended Huddersfield Grammar School in Marsh, parents Tariq and Aysha described them as delightful, hard-working and always together. Talented pupil Zamam had dreams of becoming a lawyer like his father and researching medicine for brain diseases, mum Aysha, 38, said. “He loved chemistry and was very into his football. He was a big Arsenal fan and played in the school football team. Zamam was very popular and well-behaved.”  Mohammed Ali, known as Ali, was described by his mother as full of life and interested in a career as a mathematician. Weeks before the tragedy, elder brother Zamam had written a birthday card for his father, who was away on business in Pakistan, to say: “My dad, my inspiration, my life. “You have worked so hard for us - sacrificed so much. “The country you left was the one you loved. That is the definition of the world’s best father.” Zamam also wrote: “I will pray to God that the tough journey ahead will ease for you.” The line takes on a whole new meaning for the family, who now face life without the two boys.

Tim Elcombe, chairman of British Onions, said: “We are entering unprecedented territory. We need rain but the ground is now so hard, the danger is a heavy deluge will just run off the top and hailstones could further damage the crop.” Farming schedules have been thrown into chaos by drought and intense heat. And smaller veg in shops after autumn harvests will likely be accompanied by imported produce at higher prices.  Jack Ward, chief executive of the British Growers Association, said: “It seems as though most of this year has been either too cold or too hot, or too wet or too dry. “In the long term, volumes will be down and costs will be up. It’s the law of economics. When supply is short, prices will rise.” Roger Hobson, of the British Carrot Growers Association, added the “damage is done” if the drought breaks or not.

The Met office has sai  d “ summer is not over by any means” as the country braces for temperatures over 35C.  Showers will stop from Tuesday, with temperatures increasing gradually throughout Wednesday and Thursday before they hit their mid-30s after the weekend. A high of 36C is expected into next week, the Weather Outlook said, because of high pressure and continental heat. It would beat the 35.3C day reached before the weekend, recorded as the hottest in three years.  Met Office forecaster Steven Keates said: “The weekend was not pleasant for people on summer holidays – but it warms up again later in the week. “The low 30s is not out of the question at the end of the week – and it could go higher, with forecast models showing the mid-30s after the weekend. Watch this space.” The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “The weekend was an incredible contrast to the past two months – but it looks like the hottest day of the year is still to come. “With high pressure returning, we could well beat last week and see 36C.” It comes after Britain’s 58-day drought came to an abrupt halt over the weekend when temperature dropped 18C degrees. Atlantic storms of 60mph hit the country from East to West. The sudden change in climate was branded a “shock to the system” as it saw thunderstorms that brought three inches of rain.  Thunders of 130,000 lightning bolts - containing enough energy to boil water for a billion cups of tea - hit in 24 hours to early Saturday. Met Office forecaster Steven Keates also said: “This weekend was shock to the system after hot conditions. “Heavy rain and strong winds are impacting people on holiday, camping, at festivals and travelling. “But the hot air will come back later in the week to the South and Midlands, with very high values well over 30C shown on forecast models from a week’s time.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman stung scorpion travelled 5000","story":"NewsWoman stung by scorpion that travelled 5,000 miles in her suitcase from Costa Rica to the UKThe woman from Waterlooville, Hants, was rushed to hospital after being stung by the scorpionShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByElaine McCahill17:51, 29 JUL 2018NewsA holidaymaker got the fright of her life when she was bitten by a scorpion which travelled back in her suitcase from Costa Rica (Image: WaterloovilleFireStn/Solent)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA holidaymaker got the shock of her life when she was stung by a scorpion which had travelled back in her suitcase all the way from Costa Rica.

But researchers now believe they know what happened to the pioneering aviator and her navigator after they vanished while trying to fly around the world in 1937. Earhart, 39, had already become the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean five year earlier. It was believed she had crashed into the sea after her plane, Electra, developed engine problems. But now experts have analysed Earhart\u0027s final distress calls which reveal clues which may shed light on what really happened.  Ric Gillespie believes he has proof that Earhart crash-landed on a remote South Pacific island about 2,000 miles from Hawaii - and called for help for nearly a week before her plane was swept out to sea. Gillespie, who has researched the case for more than 30 years, says the distress calls were heard around the world - and prompted the Navy to launch a rescue mission.  He told CBS News : It took the battleship a week to get there, by which time the radio signals had stopped, and when the planes flew over the island, they didn\u0027t see an airplane.  Gillespie said the calls were also heard by dozens of people who unexpectedly picked up Earhart\u0027s transmissions on their radios thousands of miles away.  Calls for help were reportedly heard in Florida, Iowa, Texas and even Canada, where a woman said she heard a voice saying we have taken in water. … We can\u0027t hold on much longer. Gillespie\u0027s organisation also re-examined bones first discovered in 1940 after they were washed up on the tiny atoll of Nikumaroro part of the nation of Kiribati. And they think Earhart lived out her final days as a castaway stranded in the middle of the Pacific.  The International Group for Historic Aircraft Discovery based in Philadelphia has been trying to prove the bones uncovered belong to the American pilot since 1998, and how they “appear consistent with a female of Earhart’s height and ethnic origin”. The bones had been previously confirmed to have belonged to a castaway, and not the victim of a plane crash. A comprehensive study of the Nikumaroro area showed bonfires had been lit and fish bones left around by someone living on the atoll. “There is an entire final chapter of Earhart’s life that people don’t know about. She spent days - maybe months - heroically struggling to survive as a castaway,” Gillespie said.  Despite speculation in 1940 that the remains were those of Earhart, British authorities rejected the claim after a doctor concluded that the bones were from a male. The bones were subsequently lost but the doctor’s files were uncovered in 1998 and included the skeletal measurements, which showed that the length of the forearm was larger than average. The aircraft recovery group has now re-examined the doctor’s findings comparing the ratio of the skeleton’s upper and lower arm bones to that from a clear photograph of Earhart standing in a short-sleeved top and concluded that the two ratios were “virtually identical”. Jeff Glickman, a forensic imaging specialist consulted by the group, examined the length of two bones - the radius and humerus - in Earhart’s left arm and found the ratio was 0.76.

The former lighting director said in an \u0026shyinterview: “I don’t do drugs, haven’t for more than 20 years.” A source insisted drugs were “part and parcel” of the TV industry and added: “Tom was no different.” Markle Snr turned to drugs to cope with the pressures of life in Hollywood and to give daughter Meghan a better life, it is claimed. The 74-year-old admitted he got high while the future duchess was young, but insisted he has not touched drugs since. He was asked in an interview about claims he is an alcoholic and replied: “I hardly drink at all, just a little wine with my dinner, nothing much.”  But he added: “I don’t do drugs, haven’t for more than 20 years.” It was also claimed Thomas, who has not spoken to 36-year-old Meghan for more than two months, cannot get hold of his daughter as she has changed her phone number. The retired Hollywood lighting director he is said to be worried he may never be allowed to see any grandchildren she may have with Prince Harry. A family source said of Thomas’ drugs admission: “When Tom worked in \u0026shytelevision, drugs were part and parcel of the industry. They were rife. “Tom was no different. He worked every hour God sent so he could give Meghan the life he wanted for her. “Sixteen-hour days were normal. Tom used to work well into the night. “The spare time he had off he’d sleep for a little while but then spend every minute he could with Meghan before going back to work. “After a while, such long hours take their toll and Tom would use drugs that helped him work for longer. Coffee just didn’t cut it.” Thomas did not specify which drugs he used in his interview with the Mail on Sunday. But his daughter Samantha said last night \u0026shymarijuana was popular at the time he worked in Hollywood. She added: “My father is upstanding and doesn’t really drink and he doesn’t do recreational drugs.  “But in the 60s, 70s and 80s for most people I know in America it was a cultural thing to smoke marijuana. “Most people did. I’m sure people like The Beatles smoked pot when they were on tour. It was a sign of the times. I don’t think my father is the only one who can ever have been condemned for having done that. He was never regularly doing it, he never smelt of it and I’ve never seen my father smoke it. “But certainly my father has never taken cocaine or any other drugs like that. He didn’t have the mentality for it. “He was a really successful lighting director which required very sharp visuals and attention to detail. “If he had been a drug addict he wouldn’t have been successful for 40 years in a highly technical job, no way.” Meghan was unaware of her dad’s drugs past. A friend told how Thomas, who is recovering from heart surgery which stopped him going to his \u0026shydaughter’s royal wedding in May, now “feels completely cut off” from her. The pal added: “He used to have Meghan’s number but now if he tries it’s dead. She, or the Palace, have changed them all. Only last week he mentioned it was Meghan’s birthday this Saturday, but he has no idea how to send her a card. We joked he should turn up himself and hand-deliver it.  “It’s disgusting he does not know how to get hold of her. “What would happen if \u0026shysomething happened to him?” Thomas’ fears over never seeing any children Meghan may have were also reported in the interview. He has made no secret of his hopes that she starts her own family. He already has three grandchildren from his two eldest children. A friend in Rosarito, Mexico, where Thomas lives, said: “Tom loves children. He dotes on them. “He knows Meghan has always wanted children, but it breaks his heart to think he will not get to see any \u0026shygrandchild she has with Harry. He keeps asking himself over and over why? The only thing he can think of is the shots he’s taken at the royal family. “Tom did so out of frustration, nothing more. “It was like no one was listening to him while his ex-wife Doria was being played out in the media as though she could do no wrong. He has some bitterness about that. What people don’t realise is how much of a role Tom played in Meg’s life.”  It had been reported Thomas felt it would be better for all had he not survived his heart operation. But Samantha insisted: “My father never said that he thought he would be better off dead. He’s very upset.” But a source said: “Tom feels it would be easier for Meghan if he were out of the picture completely. “He has told people there is a part of him that thinks it would be easier if his heart packed up all together and he was no longer around. He thinks if he did die there would be an outpouring of sympathy for Meg.” Thomas said he believes Princess Diana would have loathed the way he had been treated. He said in the interview: “They [the royals] have Meghan treating her father in a way that Harry’s mother, Princess Diana, would have loathed. That’s not what Diana stood for.” Samantha added: “I believe he’s right about what he said about Diana though because Diana was a loving humanitarian, she was very \u0026shydiplomatic and she treated her family with a lot of respect.  “But I don’t think Meghan should need someone like Diana to tell her how to treat her father. She’s almost 37, not 12, so she knows the right way to treat people. “The thing both my dad and I are sick of is our family being publicly mocked and flogged. “The challenges that we’ve had have been blown way out of proportion.” Dad-of-three Thomas and Doria, his second wife, divorced in 1987 when Meghan was six. For the next five years, she lived with her mum then moved back with her dad in Los Angeles. Meghan left for college at 17 and never returned as she pursued her acting career. But she and Thomas remained close, none more so than when his mum Doris was diagnosed with dementia in 2009. Meghan’s half-brother, Thomas Markle Jr, 51, said: “For two years, every other weekend Meghan visited gran without fail. “She would read to her, show her pictures, watch TV with her. She did anything to make life appear as normal as possible. As she grew worse gran would often forget who my dad or I was, we’d go every weekend.  “But when Meg walked in an instant smile crossed gran’s face and she knew she’d be OK. Meghan has this ability to bring comfort to those she meets, and I truly think its something similar to what Princess Diana had. She was then still very close to dad.” But after Doris died, Meghan landed a part in the US legal drama, Suits, filmed in Toronto. She and Thomas spoke less and less and he moved to Rosarito after being made \u0026shybankrupt. Since news of his daughter’s \u0026shyrelationship with Harry emerged in 2016, friends said at best contact between them has been “intermittent”. Thomas has never met the prince and has only spoken to him on the phone. But he said in his interview he wouldn’t care if Harry, 33, never spoke to him again. He added: “I’ll survive”. A week before the royal wedding on May 19 at Windsor Castle it was still not known if Thomas would walk his daughter down the aisle.

From a player who hasn’t played for a year you can see he can get about the pitch and he’s only going to get better.“I’m quite excited about him and I’m pleased he got on the scoresheet.“That opened it up because Peterhead worked really hard to try and limit us chances.“We’ve been working on that actually over in Portugal, midfielders coming from deeper positions into that area and he finished it well, too.“It was a comfortable finish, he didn’t rush it, though he did with one later in the game.“The over-riding feeling is we’re quite pleased to come away with three points because we were quite disappointed on Sunday.”Dundee went on to seal the three points in stoppage time as another new face found the net as Jean Mendy made it two goals in three games.Neil added: “I was pleased, clearly Peterhead were going to make it difficult.“They dropped everyone right off the ball and sometimes had 11 players in the last 40 yards of the pitch. That denies us space and it was difficult.“However, I thought we were patient enough and scored two really good goals.“We created a lot. I’m pleased because I know how difficult it is going to Peterhead. I’m just happy to go home winning the game because it was a difficult match.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f13f2179a.jpg ","title":"dundee people all aboard thehms unicornfor family fun","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSwashbuckling pirates stormed the HMS Unicorn as people of all ages turned out for the vessel’s summer family fun day.Youngsters dressed up and got the chance to meet unofficial mascot Pirate Bob.Children also had their faces painted and took part in sand art activities.There was even a special curator’s tour of the Music of Maritime Life.Billy Rough, education officer at the Unicorn, said: “It was such a fantastic day.“It was incredibly busy despite it being a glorious sunny day.

The first is my collections of jewellery which I design and make to be distributed to the shops that stock my designs up and down the country.“The second is my bespoke pieces.“This is where someone comes in with a design in mind or with a piece they want to be remodelled.“With my bespoke designs it is much more fun as I can be a bit more creative.“It can be a big responsibility as a lot of the time someone is grieving over the loss of a loved one and they want a piece to remember them by or they want a piece of their loved one’s jewellery reworked.“You can’t change it back, so it can be quite nerve-racking.“I have also incorporated people ashes into designs, so it can be a very emotional journey with my customer.“It is lovely that I can really help customers after the passing of a loved one with a piece that is incredibly sentimental.“The third part is teaching.“I have held workshops since the beginning. I think it makes the pieces more sentimental when someone has made the ring themselves.”After taking the plunge to work on her business full time only a year ago, Scarlett has urged anyone else in the same position to take that leap into self employment.“This business is my life and I love it. It is hard and scary to take that step but I am so glad I did it. I can really put my heart and soul into my pieces now.“I should have done it way sooner.”Scarlett’s workshops allow couples to have a personal touch at their wedding.A growing number of couples are visiting her studios to create their wedding rings – and some of those ready to get down on one knee are even coming to create a bespoke engagement ring for their other half.Scarlett said: “The workshops are incredibly popular and weddings are becoming a lot more DIY with couples wanting to be more hands on.“I love being part of the love story of making their rings.“We also hold hen parties a lot and brides love to come in and make matching silver rings with their bridesmaids.“It is a lot of fun.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people solicitors move up at law firm","story":"\t\t\t\t\tScottish law firm Thorntons has promoted 11 solicitors this month.Two have been promoted to associates and nine have been made senior solicitors across the Dundee, Fife, Perth, Angus and Edinburgh offices.The two new associates are Lynne MacIntyre and Stuart Mackie, and the senior solicitors are Steven Drake, Joanne Clancy, Lynsay McFarlane, Thomas Redpath, Neil Falconer, Megan Sweeney, Chris Gardiner and Anneli Spence.Chairman Colin Graham said: “Training and development is a core part of our growth strategy.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people spar customers raise cash for good causes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Spar store on Ballindean Road in the Douglas area of Dundee has been raising funds for a number of local good causes, including Brown Street Kennels, The Crescent in Whitfield and seven-year-old Garvie Winter, who is being treated for leukaemia.Kirsty Laing, from the store, said: “We do quite a lot of different things in the shop to raise money.“We sell a lot of books, mostly for 50p, which are really popular and we also get a lot of little things from customers who want to sell them to raise funds too.

I don’t make any secret that we are bringing someone in from Austria Vienna, a big striker, I can have a look at,” said Csaba.“We are talking with one other player and hope the signings can be made, the deals are done.“I hope by next week we will have a complete team.”United also hope to be boosted by the sight of another new striker, Craig Curran, making his debut when they complete their Betfred Cup campaign at Elgin City this Saturday.Curran was due back in training today after the dead leg that’s sidelined him for the past two weeks.If he completes his work over the next couple of days without suffering a reaction, he will be on duty up north and back on course to be ready for the league kick-off against Dunfermline next week.“We have been working on Craig and, if he is OK, he can get 45 minutes against Elgin and that would be good news.”Defender Callum Booth is another who has been in the wars but could be back on duty at the weekend.The former Partick Thistle man picked up a knock at Ross County last week and missed out against Alloa but could be ready over the next couple of days.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ten minutes each game has cost us says dundee united boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo believes 10 minutes per game has been the difference between success and failure in Dundee United’s Betfred Cup campaign.That’s why the Tangerines are heading for Elgin on Saturday for what is a dead rubber.However, he’s seen enough from his team in the other 240 minutes of their group games to remain confident a successful league campaign lies ahead.“Unfortunately, a football match is 90 minutes. If we’d played 80 minutes we are the winners,” he said.“It sounds stupid but true. Against Arbroath, after 82 minutes if we put the ball out we keep one zero but we don’t and lose a goal.“In the next game (Ross County), for 80 minutes we made a good game and if we score from our penalty we win. We don’t score from the penalty, then they score and win but we had played a good game.“Then we controlled the game against Alloa but lost a goal, again in the last 10 minutes. So people say we are a bad team. We are not and not everything has been bad.”While he’s confident United will show that in the months ahead, Csaba doesn’t hide his frustration over being out of the Betfred.“We created pressure for the club, for the management, for the players and from the fans.“And we lost a lot of money, let’s be honest. So, I am really unhappy, but I can’t turn this back.“We have to do better. When we have 10 minutes to go and we are in the front, we have to win the game.”Any pressure the past three games has put on him does not, he’s stressed, match the pressure he puts on himself for every outing.“I always have pressure because when we lose I think why did we. For me, there is always the pressure that this is not OK. I think about it all the time and we have to find the solution tactically.”For the manager, that solution lies in getting the right mix between the passing style he prefers and a more direct Scottish approach.“Some people tell me I play too much continental football, we have to play Scottish football, kick the ball more off the front.“We’ll mix, keep the ball down and try to kick the long ball as well but just the long balls won’t be enough.“With Craig Curran injured we have had to use Paul McMullan as a No 9, up beside Nicky Clark sometimes.

It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me.

She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.\"She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page

Council.There were also offers to provide lifeguard cover and Nairn Business Improvement District also came forward to say it would help.In the end, Highland Council agreed to waive permission fees.\"It couldn\u0026rsquot have gone ahead without the security company and everyone else who is helping for free,\" said Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes, who has also been delighted at the offers of prizes from local businesses.Weather permitting, the event will now go ahead on Sunday with registration taking place from 10am at Nairn Links for categories ranging from pre-school through to teenagers and

community","story":"\u0026nbspTHE length of time being taken to start work on the fire-ravaged former Eastgate Hostel in Inverness city centre is \"unacceptable\", a senior Highland Council official has admitted.Public anger over a lack of visible action at the site \u0026ndash which went up in flames in April 2013 \u0026ndash has been growing as assurances of forward movement repeatedly come to nothing.Most recently it was suggested that the scaffolding could be down by June after a planning application was lodged to demolish the remaining structure and rebuild.This was scuppered when Highland Council\u0027 conservation and building officer objected that, at one storey lower than the original, the proposed rebuild would not \"preserve or enhance the character and appearance\" of a designated conservation area.Historic Environment Scotland also voiced disquiet, sending the building\u0027 owners back to the drawing board.Now Inverness city manager David Haas \u0026ndash who has generally sought to paint the protracted discussions over the building in the most positive light \u0026ndash appears to have fully acknowledged the depth of dissatisfaction as the city finds itself in the midst of a sixth tourist season with the unsightly ruin still in place.\"We know it is taking far too long and that it is an unacceptable length of time,\" he said after the Inverness Courier again sought answers over progress.\"It is not moving as fast as we would like.\"It is frustrating but we want to make sure we get it right and we want to make sure it happens.\"We respect the fact the owners have to make the right decision for their own interest but we have to make sure we represent the public interest and that it is protected as far as the law will allow us to do that.\"Agent for the site owners, Gary Johnston, said they would not comment at this time.The last public announcement made by two of them \u0026ndash Mr Ali and Mr Cheng \u0026ndash came in a statement last month where they claimed \"a new way forward\" was being investigated, but would not elaborate on what that entailed.No more details were forthcoming when the Courier contacted Mr Johnston more recently.Pat Hayden, chairwoman of Crown and City Centre Community Council, said she is glad Mr Haas has finally admitted the situation is \"unacceptable\", believing the community is \"being made a fool of\" over the whole saga.\"It has been for a long time and we have the right as a community to ask for an update and to get one,\" she said.\"The whole thing has been kept very hush-hush and there has to be something wrong for it to have taken five years \u0026ndash there is a bad smell about the whole thing.\"Talking about the impact of so prominent a building sitting untended for so long she said: \"It looks like the people of Inverness don\u0026rsquot care.\"Chiropodist Jim Crawford, whose practice lies just beyond the former hostel in Stephens Brae, branded the ongoing situation \"a complete disgrace\", and repeated his previous calls for the council to compulsorily purchase the building.\"It has been \u0026lsquounacceptable\u0026rsquo since day one,\" he said.\"Mr Haas has been trying to keep everyone happy and now no-one is happy.\"Mr Haas insisted a lot of work is continuing \"behind the scenes\", including council officers working with the owners to provide the appropriate information to enable planning officials to provide, in return, the right advice regarding the outstanding planning application.\"We need facts and once we have the facts we can move forward,\" he

Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone. I think it is a good project and if necessary I will be the first to dip my toe in the water there.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"This has had youth engagement all along and I think it is something that is going to sit well in the environment of a place that will become even more popular as people engage with the river.\"Masterminding the project is Bespoke Atelier, a Glasgow-based design studio.Its design statement, which will be discussed at a planning meeting later this summer, explains the lades and weirs already around the River Ness were used as inspiration. The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Monday 30 Jul 2018 5:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116840.jpg","title":"New team aims to make changes easier","story":"\u0026nbspA NEW team of health and social care professionals has been established to support disabled people transition from children to adult services.People aged between 14 and 25 were traditionally supported by Highland Council\u0027s children\u0027s services and NHS Highland\u0027s adult services.The new transitioning team will provide a consistent platform for young people, parents and carers at what can be a challenging time.Nicola Stewart, transitions team manager, said: \"The team has been set up in response to recognising that the transition period can be difficult for young people and their families and carers.\"There are a lot of changes in a young person\u0027s life during that period, such as leaving full-time education and starting employment, and we don\u0027t want the process of transitioning from one service to another to exacerbate that.\"The overarching vision for the team is to take young people living in the Inner Moray Firth area through the process of transition and to support them in a more consistent way than has been possible in the past.\"Transitions team manager Stella Chisholm said: \"The establishment of the team will provide the opportunity for the one service to support an individual from 14 years of age all the way through to 25.\"This is a fantastic example of joint working.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live.

Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done.

So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 26/07/18, 9:24 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out.

Sadly the rally was over for both crews after stage four due to electrical problems and other issues.Donald Bowness battled it out in the usual competitive class two with his Vauxhall Nova with Andrew Blackwood on the notes. Bowness enjoyed the battle with Michael Harbour during a Saturday which saw crews struggle to keep cars cool while specators looked on in glorious sunshine.

Another local man, Jamie Miller, finished an impressive third in the class on what was his first time out in his new car \u0026#8211 without so much as  a test drive in his the Citroen C2R2 Max.Class one saw Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter battle it out in Innes\u0026#8217 newly built Rover , with another excellent drive from the pair who also finished the rally with a trophy win, coming third in their class.

NHS Ayrshire \u0026amp Arran this week appealed for drivers to help to keep the grounds as safe as possible for patients, visitors and staff. The car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse have designated short and long stay areas which are clearly signposted. The short stay car parks have a time limit of three hours and the long stay car parks are for people who need to park for longer than three hours. When the car parking scheme was first implemented, there was a significant improvement in parking behaviours. However, this has not continued. John Wright, director for corporate support services, said: “Over the past few years we have carried out surveys and audits of the car parks at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse and created more than 400 new spaces across both sites. However, we have now reached the limit of the number of new car parking spaces we can build. We are, therefore, asking for help from members of the public. “We need to make sure that we all play our part in parking appropriately and safely in all of our car parks across all of our sites. This will help traffic to flow better, reduce the risk of accidents and ensure that we comply with health and safety regulations.” Mr Wight is urging motorists to: park only in a designated parking bay and do not park on footpaths, or at road junction He urged drivers notto park in disabled parking spaces if you do not have a blue badge Mr Wright said people can help reduce congestion at car park by travelling to the hospital by public transport or car share. He added: “We know that parking is challenging on our sites, particularly at University Hospitals Ayr and Crosshouse. “However, we are limited to the number of spaces we have and this is why we are urging the public and our staff to help us and to park appropriately. We will also be looking at other ways of reducing the volume of traffic on our sites at particular times of the day.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr HospitalUniversities and CollegesCrosshouseAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock man who lifelong alcohol","story":"NewsKilmarnock man who has had lifelong alcohol struggle shares heartbreaking story and says: \"I don\u0027t want my grandson seeing me drunk every day\"At his worst Andrew from Kilmarnock could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer.Share\u0026nbspByDavid Wren12:25, 27 JUL 2018NewsAndrew has struggled with drink his whole life (picture posed by model)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“I’ve got a daughter and a grandson, I don’t want them seeing me drunk everyday,” says Andrew, who has struggled with alcohol for most of his adult life. At his worst, the 59-year-old from Kilmarnock – who has asked for his surname to be withheld – could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer. His situation was desperate, with the alcohol numbing the pain of crippling mental health issues he has suffered from for years. Andrew spoke out after it was revealed in last week’s Kilmarnock Standard that there were 48 alcohol-related deaths at Crosshouse Hospitalin 2017/18, an increase from 38 in the previous year. Illnesses and injuries related to alcohol which have been treated at the facility have also gone up, with NHS Ayrshire and Arran aiming to tackle the problem.  Andrew said: “I’ve been drinking repeatedly for 25 years. I used to drink a litre of vodka a day and roughly four litres per week. “I’d maybe have 10 or 15 pints of beer a day as well. I sought help from various organisations which didn’t help. “I’ve been struggling with my mental health over the years too. The main reason I’ve been hitting the drink is because of my mental health and I can’t get any help.” His battles with drink and mental health have led Andrew to dark places and he has attempted suicide twice. A chaotic lifestyle where he has had brushes with the law over the years also played a part in his mindset, as well as an incident in his late teens where a gun was put to his head. The terrifying ordeal, Andrew says, “wasted my head” and he continues to have flashbacks. It started off his spiralling issues with anxiety and depression which have plagued his life and repeatedly led him back to alcohol. After one suicide attempt, Andrew said that he was told to quit his vodka habit and did so overnight. But the consequences of going cold turkey led to a mild stroke the following day. Battles with his health have continued over the years, meaning he is now on 17 tablets a day just to help his body function. Andrew doesn’t consider himself an alcoholic, but admits he has struggled with drink for most of his life. He also claims that he’s struggled to access help for his mental health issues. He said: “I’ve been to various organisations and they hunt me. “They take the name and address, say they’ll contact you – then nothing.  “So I go to drink and that solves the mental health problems. “But it actually triggers it. Sometimes it eases me and it’s a bit back to front. “These mental health organisations have no money, no funds and the NHS is in a terrible state. “The only people I can rely on are the Ayrshire Council on Alcohol down in Ayr. “I’m not an alcoholic, I’ve just got a problem with drink. “I don’t like being called an alcoholic, I’m just a normal guy that needs help.” The Ayrshire Council on Alcohol have helped him work on his problem with drink. Although on a long road to recovery, Andrew’s drinking has decreased. But, even though the alcohol counselling helps, he admits he’s desperate to tackle his mental health issues. He said: “I’m down to drinking four days a week now, before I would have been seven. The ACA have helped me, I would recommend them to anybody. “They explain the circumstances and give you a target to achieve over a period. They don’t want you to come off of it straight away. “It maybe goes from seven days to five and so on.” He continued: “In a day I’ll maybe drink 15 pints. That used to be every day but now I’ve cut it down to four. “It’s a lot of beer. It’s very hard to say the effect the alcohol has on me. “My main issue is the mental health, the anxiety and depression, my head’s wasted.” Having been in the habit of drinking every day for so long, Andrew removes himself from the dangers of binging when his days away from alcohol come around.   He goes on day trips across Ayrshire to keep him away from the lure of  the pub, which Andrew admits he would struggle to resist if he was just hanging around Kilmarnock town centre.  Although he lives himself, Andrew says he doesn’t drink in the house and bottles of booze stay untouched in his home. The social aspect of the pub, he says, is the lure for him as he seeks the company it brings. Andrew believes he can quit drink – but admits his mental health constantly brings him back to square one as he looks for a life away from alcohol. He says the ACA is saving his life with their support and he hopes continued work with the organisation can help him to live a healthy life. “At times I was just desperate, thinking ‘why live?’” said Andrew. “But I’ve got a grandson now, a daughter, so it gives me something to look forward to in the future. “Hopefully one day I can come off the drink. “Never say never – it’s my ambition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrKilmarnockAlcoholCrosshouse"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

Ayr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event to raise awareness and money for UNICEF. Pupils had a kicking time as they took part in football challenges ranging from beat the goalie to foot bowl – football’s equivalent of 10 pin bowling.  And, of course, the youngsters enjoyed being pictured with Ayr’s own sporty star Michael, who brought along the League 1 trophy. The event was a huge success, raising \u0026pound338 for UNICEF and helping raise awareness for young people in need throughout the UK and beyond.

And reader Brian Cassells snapped this image of the creature from the deep. “I’d never seen anything like it before,” said Brian, who was out walking with wife Julie and their two small pet dogs. “At first I thought it must be part of a fishing net, or some kind of rope from a boat. “But then, looking closer at it, it was more like a giant version of those little bones you see when you open a tin of salmon.” Aircraft mechanic Brian, 55, also noted what looked like the remains of a large fin on the sea monster. The carcass was in the water when he first spotted it. But he got a better look on a return walk, two days later. “It had started to break up a bit,” said Brian. “But I got a chance to pace out a rough measurement on dry land.  “And I reckon it was at least 20 feet long.” The Post passed on Brian’s pictures to Girvan-based David Bova, a retired Marine Scotland scientist. David, 61, said: “The images suggest the remains of a basking shark. “Shark skeletons are cartilage rather than bone, and this looks to be the case here.” David explained that basking sharks tend to be seasonal visitors to the Firth of Clyde, feeding on plankton bloom. The gentle giants can grow to over 30ft long, and weigh several tons. “I haven’t seen one so far this summer,” said David, who is regularly out on the waters around Ailsa Craig. Brian was interested to hear David’s opinion, and agrees with his view that the skeleton was more like cartilage than bone. “We kept Daisy (Bichon Frise) and Millie (Cavachon) well away anyway!” he joked.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

León, as well as more modern performances featuring lasers and pyrotechnics.While some younger children weren\u0026#8217t too keen on the clowns, who interacted with the audience throughout much of the performance, others found them the most amusing, their slapstick capers eliciting some of the biggest laughs.The most heart-stopping moments came from aerial artiste, Alexandra, whose skills on an elevated hoop were astounding, and one of the Jackson Family, who balanced precariously atop a ladder.Other tense moments came from an entertainer who spun various items at the same time with her hands and feet, including a pole that was on fire at either end, the audience waiting to see if it would plummet into the stands.Even the more basic stunts, like juggling, had an added element of tension, with the objects, resembling yo-yos, launched many feet into the air by a rope.The animal-free circus continued its UK tour, leaving Campbeltown on Thursday morning heading for Arran, before

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.

Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rahs-make-waves-across-the-world","story":"  The band, from Prestonpans, released their latest single Survival through their independent platform EH32 Records last week and have been thrilled by the response it has received.

Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

The 63-year-old passed away on March 2, having been minister at St Mary\u0026rsquos Parish Church for more than a decade.  Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.

Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8129137.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"map-highlights-alcohol-hotspots-of-east-lothian","story":"  The study by Alcohol Focus Scotland, alongside the Centre for Research on Environment, Society and Health, flagged up hotspots in Musselburgh, Haddington and North Berwick.

As well as the Red Arrows, the aerial line-up features the delta-winged RAF Typhoon fighter-bomber and a Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane and Avro Lancaster bomber from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight.  Lancaster bombers were used in the famous Dambusters raid, which marks its 75th anniversary this year.  On-the-ground entertainment includes talks by former Concorde first officer Tony Yule and aviator Tracey Curtis-Taylor, who shares tales of her aerial adventures in her Boeing Stearman biplane.  Two of her journeys followed in the footsteps of early female aviators Amy Johnson and Lady Mary Heath and involved flights of thousands of miles over dozens of countries.  The airshow, which is expected to attract more than 13,000 people, also offers the chance to see displays by European Bike Trial champion Aaron Duke, as well as live music, dancing, cheerleading, children\u0026rsquos entertainment and stalls.

Most likely such notions were planted in the US President\u0026rsquos mind during that one-to-one session in Helsinki with his Russian counterpart. It\u0026rsquos long been no secret that Moscow by hook or by crook did all it could to prevent Montenegro becoming the latest Nato member, even though the little Balkan nation finally succeeded in doing so last year much to the Kremlin\u0026rsquos chagrin.  Working therefore on the basis that Mr Putin has had remarkable success in inducing Mr Trump to promote the Kremlin\u0026rsquos interests and parrot its agenda, it\u0026rsquos probably fair to expect another small Balkan country to become the subject of both men\u0026rsquos ire in the coming months.  I\u0026rsquom talking of course about Macedonia, or to give it its proper name as known at the United Nations, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Fyrom).  Names matter here, indeed in \u0026ldquoMacedonia\u0026rsquos case what the country is actually called is already impacting on its future political direction of travel and will almost certainly bring it opprobrium from the Kremlin and therefore de-facto Mr Trump.  But before looking at such a prospect, it\u0026rsquos first necessary to rewind back to where the contentious issue of Macedonia\u0026rsquos name comes from and an agreement it signed last month with Greece.  It was in 1991 in the wake of the break-up of the former Yugoslavia that Greece\u0026rsquos northern neighbour called itself Macedonia.  For its part Greece was none to pleased and objected to the name, fearing territorial claims and ambitions on its eponymous northern region that includes the country\u0026rsquos second city, Thessaloniki.  The fledging Macedonia did little to defuse Greek anger with among other gestures calling its main airport in its capital Skopje after Ancient Greek hero Alexander. All this though is itself now history, given that after years of bickering, protests and talks the two neighbours have now reached an agreement.  Under the deal, signed on June 17, Macedonia agreed to change its name to Republic of North Macedonia. In return Greece has agreed to end its long-standing blockade of Macedonia\u0026rsquos membership of Nato and the EU.  As so often happens in the Balkans though, not everything is that straightforward.  For starters if the deal is to be fully implemented, then Macedonians must show their support in a referendum and likewise the Greek parliament must be on side.  For the moment it\u0026rsquos the first of these domestic political hurdles that is proving the trickiest.  For just as Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and his ruling social democrats (SDSM) pushes hard for the renaming referendum to take place in the Autumn, so one of two main opposition groups in the country, the VMRO-DPMNE party has pushed back. Its supporters see the deal as little more than a shameful capitulation to Athens, something Mr Zaev has condemned as backward looking.  \u0026ldquoInstead of boarding the train bound for the EU and Nato, he chose to stay on the dark side of history, Mr Zaev was recently quoted as saying of opposition leader Hristijan Mickovski\u0026rsquos reluctance to move forward with the renaming vote.  Despite the obvious acrimony between the two sides, many remain confident the name change ballot will still take place, opening the way for the new Republic of North Macedonia to become part of the Nato and EU fold.  Should things move in this direction then cue Mr Putin\u0026rsquos full efforts to thwart Macedonia\u0026rsquos Nato aspirations in much the same way he did in Montenegro. That much was already evident last month when according to authorities in Athens, Russia tried to pay off Greek clerics and officials to oppose the Macedonia-Greece deal.  The meddling prompted the Greek government of prime minister Alexis Tsipras this month to expel two Russian diplomats and deny entry to two others, while accusing the Kremlin of \u0026ldquoconstant disrespect for Greece.  It was an extraordinary move by the normally Russophilic Greek government that has been one of Russia\u0026rsquos best European friends.  Moscow in turn responded by cancelling a planned visit to Athens by foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and the two countries continue to trade angry statements.  In Macedonia itself, meanwhile, evidence suggests that Russia\u0026rsquos GRU military spy service is already using the sensitive mood in the country to stir up nationalist and anti-Western resentment, and so hindering Macedonia\u0026rsquos referendum route to Nato.  A few weeks ago Macedonia interior ministry documents seen by the local partner of the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) reportedly revealed one key source of payments to opponents of the renaming referendum.  According to the group\u0026rsquos investigative journalists, Ivan Savvidi, a Russian billionaire living in Greece who was formerly a member of the Russian parliament and United Russia party, made payments worth at least \u0026curren300,000 to recently created radical nationalist organisations willing to foment unrest in the country. A similar Russian role was also uncovered in neighbouring Greece.  Intelligence service watchers say that what has been unfolding in Macedonia is almost a carbon copy of what happened in Montenegro, though in the latter, Russian intelligence operatives were also involved in plotting a violent coup that would have ended in the assassination of Montenegro\u0026rsquos pro-Western leader, Milo Djukanovic.  Much of course might still happen that could derail Macedonia\u0026rsquos renaming referendum and accession to Nato and EU membership.  If one thing is certain though, it\u0026rsquos that undaunted by his failure in Montenegro, Mr Putin is again pulling out the stops and sending forth the spooks and dirty tricks brigade to make things difficult in a country Russia insists as being within its sphere of influence.  It would come as no surprise too if all of a sudden, Mr Trump again suddenly discovers yet another small Balkan country on the map called Macedonia and joins the Kremlin\u0026rsquos chorus of mischief making."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-james-kelly-calls-for-independent-review-of-football-policing-after-fans-filmed-at-parkhead","story":"  James Kelly issued the call after a spat between the single force and a fans\u0026rsquo group over police officers filming supporters at a Celtic friendly match.  Introduced by Alex Salmond\u0026rsquos SNP Government, the Offensive Behaviour at Football Act (OBFA) was passed in response to trouble at an Old Firm match and after parcel bombs were sent to former Celtic manager Neil Lennon and others.  However, the law was derided by legal experts, football supporters and opposition politicians who believed it singled out fans for special treatment.  READ: Scottish Labour leader under pressure over anti-semitism row  READ: Richard Leonard should stop acting like Corbyn is his boss  Kelly, a Glasgow MSP, secured cross-party support this year to repeal a law that was described by one sheriff as \u0026ldquomince.  Although the Act has been scrapped, prosecutors have rebadged the outstanding charges as breaches of different legislation, a move critics believe is symptomatic of wider problems with the way football fans are dealt with by the criminal justice system.  During a recent pre-season friendly between Celtic and Standard Liege at Parkhead, a police officer pointed a video camera at a group of fans. After the incident was flagged up by Fans Against Criminalisation \u0026ndash a group which was set up to oppose the OBFA \u0026ndash the official Police Scotland Twitter account responded: \"Officers were deployed as a result of pro IRA songs being sung by a section of the crowd.\"  The force added: \u0026ldquoIf you don\u0026rsquot want police filming supporters at the game, don\u0026rsquot commit a crime. Both tweets were posted in the name of Superintendent John McBride.  Kelly said: \u0026ldquoDespite the repeal of the Act four months ago, the policing strategy at games can feel over the top and I have heard from numerous fans that it is ruining their match days. Only the other weekend we saw a cop pointing a video camera at a stand filming individual fans just watching the football, and then the official Police Scotland account sending passive aggressive tweets telling fans not to commit crime.  \u0026ldquoAt any other event you would expect to be treated with dignity by the police. That is sadly not the case in Scotland. Football fans are second-class citizens to the SNP Government, and that is why Labour is calling for an independent review of the way football policing is carried out.  FAC asked the Police Scotland for clarification of the tweets, after which McBride emailed the group about the controversy: \u0026ldquoI was the match commander of that fixture and prior to the game information had been received that \u0027Ultra\u0027 fans from Belgium would be attending the fixture. Being unaware of the threat these fans posed, I instructed officers with cameras be included in the match day operation.  He added: \u0026ldquoAt no time in my response on Twitter did I indicate that I felt that anyone connected with Fans Against Criminalisation were (or indeed are) in any way responsible for any of the actions that led to the police filming fans at that fixture and I would hope that you accept this communication as confirmation of that.  Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins said: \"The policing of football matches is under constant review and while there is a general framework of how we approach them, the tactics and deployments will vary dependent on circumstances such as the nature of the match and the risk associated with it. As in the past, I or my colleagues will happily meet with any supporters\u0027 groups to discuss any concerns they may have.\""},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-on-pro-independence-march-in-inverness","story":"  Kilted musicians playing bagpipes and snare drums were followed by people of all ages holding Saltires and Catalan flags, as well as Yes Scotland merchandise.

It comes as farmers were also due to meet with Government officials for a \"drought summit\" to discuss the effect on the country\u0027s food supplies of the extensive heatwave that has scorched the UK.  The first half of the summer in the UK has been the driest since 1961 with Thursday and Friday\u0027s wet weather and storms the first rainfall in weeks.  Mr Gove said that firms \"have much more to do to tackle leakage\", adding: \"That is why I have repeatedly made clear that companies must improve and recently wrote to them to outline my expectations during this period of dry weather.  \"Next week I will ask the chief executives of the water companies that have failed to meet their leakage targets to a meeting at Defra to discuss how they are going to address this serious issue and improve their performance.\"  United Utilities has previously been accused of \"wasting\" 430 million litres of water every day from leakages.  The GMB union said earlier this month that its research showed that United Utilities was allowing 175 Olympic-sized swimming pools\u0027 worth of water to go \"down the plughole\" every day.  The company said at the time that \"reducing leaks is a top priority\".  Irrigation water shortages, a lack of fresh forage for animals and growing conditions for cereal crops are among issues that will be discussed at separate talks chaired by National Farmers\u0027 Union president Minette Batters.  She will sit down on Wednesday with officials from Defra and a wide array of rural agencies, plus figures from farming charities after a July that has seen England receive just 15% of its long-term average rainfall.  Ms Batters described the situation as \"hugely challenging\" for all sectors of farming, warning that the thunderstorms and showers some areas are receiving \"won\u0027t mitigate the many issues farmers are experiencing\".  She said: \"There could be serious concerns for many farmers if this extended spell of warmer, drier weather continues as the long-range forecast suggests.\"  Those due to attend the summit alongside Defra include the Environment Agency, Natural England, the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) and farming charities RABI and Farming Community Network, the NFU said.  Last week the Environment Agency said it had responded to 44 \"significant\" environmental incidents since the end of June, including moorland fires, algal blooms, dry boreholes, low river flows and fish rescues as the hot, dry weather continues to grip.  The last month of dry, hot weather followed the driest June since 1925, the Environment Agency said. It has seen the water level in many reservoirs fall dramatically.  While only one water company is currently planning a hosepipe ban, continued dry weather into the autumn could see a risk of further restrictions and impacts on the environment, the National Drought Group said.  Ms Batters added: \"This unprecedented spell of weather really should be a wake-up call for us all. It\u0027s a timely reminder that we shouldn\u0027t take food production for granted.  \"Farming is one of the most affected industries when it comes to managing volatility.\""},{"url":null,"title":"think-tank-in-windrush-call-on-post-brexit-id-system","story":"  Extending the documentation programme for the 3.6 million Europeans living here to everyone else is among a sweeping overhaul of the immigration system recommended in a new report to strengthen the UK border.  Britain leaving the EU is the perfect time to come up with new ways of controlling national borders, the paper published on Monday by Policy Exchange suggests.  The idea of a national ID system for British citizens has been controversial for some time, with many people opposing it on civil liberties grounds.  A \u0026pound5 billion national identity card scheme was introduced by the last Labour government in 2006 but a Bill to scrap it was the first legislation introduced by Theresa May when she became home secretary in 2010.  EU citizens already in the UK will have to pay \u0026pound65 and join a registration scheme if they wish to stay in Britain after the end of the transition period on December 31 2020 under changes announced by the current Home Secretary Sajid Javid.  In the report, David Goodhart, Policy Exchange\u0027s head of demography, immigration and integration, suggests that the scheme should be widened to Britons, initially on a voluntary basis.  He said: \"We strongly recommend reopening the debate about ID management to reassure people that we know who is in the country, for how long, and what their entitlements are.  \"A proper national ID system would have prevented the harassment of the Windrush victims.\"  Among the other ideas in The Border Audit: A Post-Windrush Review, are:  - A more decisive removals process, that gets people out before they can judicially review their cases, plus reforms to allow applications for asylum from outside the UK and private sponsorship of them.  - An amnesty for illegal immigrants who have been in the UK for 10 years or more  - More cash to pay illegal immigrants to leave and a joint scheme involving the Department for International Development to help them set up businesses in their countries of origin  - A British version of the US Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (ESTA) that allows non-UK citizens to use e-gates at borders and made it quicker for \"low-risk groups\" to enter  - One single \"command\" responsible for sea borders, under one person based in Portsmouth  - Make rail and ferry operators provide more information about passengers and introduce more collaboration with Irish authorities to close down the Common Travel Area \"backdoor\"  - Reduce citizenship application fees from \u0026pound1,500 per person and almost \u0026pound5,000 for a family with two children to a level \"more closely aligned to public policy, not just revenue needs\"  - Higher overall investment, including better detection systems for lorries at Calais and Dover, more staff and more border patrol boats  Mr Goodhart added: \"Illegal immigration is not only unfair on legal immigrants who wait their turn in the queue and the employers and businesses who play (and pay) by the rules, it also fosters a twilight world of criminality, dependence and exploitation in which modern slavery flourishes.  \"While a general amnesty for the estimated 500,000 illegal residents here would send the wrong signal, some form of regularisation should also be considered for those who have been here for more than 10 years, who are now parts of their communities with ties to the UK and often become the focus of grassroots campaigns.\"  A Home Office spokesman said: \"We are pursuing an ambitious programme of reform at the border as well as investing in new capability to improve passenger experience.  \"Examples of this include e-Passport gates and motion detection technology which benefit passengers and improve security.  \"Border Force invested \u0026pound63.5 million in new technology and capability in 2017-18 and \u0026pound90.4 million in the two previous years combined.  \"Decisions on the future immigration system will be based on evidence.  \"This is why we have asked the independent Migration Advisory Committee (MAC) to advise on the economic and social impacts of the UK\u0027s exit from the EU and also on how the UK\u0027s immigration system should be aligned with a modern industrial strategy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"close-call-predicted-but-interest-rates-expected-to-rise","story":"  In what would mark another milestone for the economy in its recovery since the financial crisis, members of nine-strong Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) are expected to increase rates from 0.5% to 0.75% on Thursday.  The move would see rates hit their highest level since March 2009, when they were slashed from 1% to 0.5% as the financial meltdown and recession wrought havoc.  Investec economist George Brown said he is \"fairly confident\" the Bank will move to raise rates and is pencilling in an 8-1 vote in favour, with Sir Jon Cunliffe the only dissenter.  He believes the economy has performed in line with the Bank\u0027s last forecasts in May, when it backed off from a widely anticipated hike and said it wanted to wait and see how the economy recovered after a weather-hit start to the year.  The bank also edged a step closer to pressing the button in June when its chief economist Andy Haldane joined two fellow policymakers in calling for a rise.  Howard Young at the EY Item Club believes the vote may be less definitive, given that inflation figures recently came in lower than expected - unchanged at 2.4% in June, while wage growth has also been weak.  He said: \"It has recently become a closer call, but we believe that the odds still favour the Bank of England lifting interest rate from 0.50% to 0.75% on Thursday after the August MPC meeting - most likely following a split vote.\"  He added: \"With interest rates down at 0.50%, the Bank of England would clearly likely to gradually normalise monetary policy given that it is essentially an emergency low rate.  \"Furthermore, inflation remains above target and the labour market looks relatively tight with the MPC considering that there is little slack left in the economy.\"  The decision to raise rates would come as a blow to some borrowers on variable rate mortgages, but would offer relief to savers who have seen paltry returns on deposits since rates have languished at 0.5% or below since 2009.  It is thought the bank\u0027s latest set of forecasts in the accompanying inflation report will reinforce the case for a rise, with many economists expecting growth to have recovered to 0.4% in the second quarter after slowing to 0.2% in the previous three months.  The bank had already predicted in May that this would be the case and its latest set of forecasts are set to confirm its outlook for the year ahead.  But the bank is likely to increase its inflation forecasts, with a weaker pound and higher oil and energy prices pushing up the outlook and further justifying the need for a rise.  A rate rise in August would be the second hike in the past year, after the Bank voted for an increase from 0.25% to 0.5% in November - the first such move for more than 10 years and reversing the cut made in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.  Mr Brown believes this will be the only increase in 2018, however, predicting a quarter point rise every six months until they reach 1.5% in 2020.  \"We think the bank wants to raise rates in a gradual way and that would be consistent with the next one in February,\" he said."},{"url":null,"title":"britains-longest-running-childrens-comic-the-beano-celebrates-its-80th-birthday","story":"  And although Dennis the Menace and Minnie the Minx still look as youthful as ever as you flick through the pages, the comic is celebrating its 80th birthday.  A series of events have been staged to mark the landmark anniversary and the comic\u0026rsquos editorial director has pledged it will continue to laugh at the world \u0026ldquovia a kid\u0026rsquos-eye view in the years ahead.  Created by DC Thomson in Dundee, the Beano hit stands on July 30, 1938 as a companion paper to The Dandy, which went on sale eight months earlier.  In an age free of modern technology, it built a loyal following, going on to sell almost two million copies weekly in the 1950s.  With a copy of the comic sold every 17 seconds in the UK now, it continues to endear itself to youngsters today as parents introduce their children to the characters they loved when they were young.  In Dundee, the McManus museum has been renamed McMenace for an exhibition on the comic, including original artwork, a first edition of the Beano, fan club memorabilia and a history of publishers DC Thomson, with visitors encouraged to dress up as their favourite characters.  Actor and children\u0026rsquos author David Walliams has guest edited a commemorative issue also marking the anniversary.  In his editor\u0026rsquos letter, Walliams said: \u0026ldquoWhat I always loved about the Beano was that it felt naughty. It was a comic that you should read under the duvet with a torchlight. I don\u0026rsquot think I\u0026rsquod have got into writing my books without Beano.  \u0026ldquoWhen coming up with characters for my TV shows and books, I\u0026rsquod imagine them all as larger than life characters, much like the ones in Beano. The comic is quintessentially British and as long as there are children who like to laugh there will always be a place for the Beano.  Most of the Beano\u0026rsquos best-known characters were introduced to the pages of the Beano in the years after its launch, with the first edition fronted by Big Eggo The Ostrich who kept his place there for a decade before being ousted by Biffo the Bear.  Very few first issues of the Beano remain in existence, with one selling for more than \u0026pound17,000 at auction in 2015. Dennis the Menace is the longest-running character to appear in the comic. He made his Beano debut on March 17, 1951, but the \u0026ldquoWorld\u0026rsquos Wildest Boy had to wait until May 5 of that year to be given his trademark black-and-red stripped jumper.  Beano has also diversified to target a new online audience, launching Beano in 2016, which has been visited by 2.5million children. Meanwhile, 1.86 million copies of Beano were sold in 2017, with latest figures showing a 7.9% year-on-year increase in sales, recording weekly sales figures of 37,542 copies.  To further mark the special birthday, Beano have relaunched the infamous Fan Club, offering free membership and printable club badges and certificates.  Mike Stirling, editorial director of Beano Studios, said: \u0026ldquoEverything about Beano has always evolved naturally, inspired by the kids we speak and listen to, every single day.  \u0026ldquoThey\u0026rsquove ensured the situations our characters find themselves in are always relatable to every generation. It\u0026rsquos all underpinned by our philosophy of laughing at the world via a kid\u0026rsquos-eye view.  \u0026ldquoOur online hub, Beano - the fastest growing kids\u0026rsquo website in the UK - and No 1 smash-hit Dennis and Gnasher Unleashed animation series now mean more kids than ever before are enjoying Beano-inspired everyday rebellion."},{"url":null,"title":"britain-faces-green-transport-revolution-as-uk-ministers-consider-electric-delivery-vehicles-for-cities","story":"  Britain is facing a green \u0026ldquotransport revolution with the government determined to find ways of reducing congestion and cutting pollution.  With the UK having more than four million vans and lorries on its roads, whose numbers are set to increase with more online sales, it has been suggested they are replaced with a range of electronic transport, including vans, cargo bikes, quadricycles and micro vehicles, to transform the last-mile deliveries across congested cities.  The idea forms part of Whitehall\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoLast Mile and Future of Mobility document, published today, calling for ways to tackle the problem of traffic in city centres.  UK ministers say the documents offer a glimpse into how technology could transform the country\u0026rsquos transport system, making it safer, more accessible and greener than ever.  The Department for Transport suggested travel around the UK could dramatically change with the \u0026ldquointroduction of flying vehicles or widespread use of self-driving cars, all while travel data would help to deliver better journeys.  It noted that the potential increased use of self-driving vehicles and shared travel could also transform how city centres look in years to come. For example, the majority of parking spaces could be removed, opening areas up for redevelopment and potentially hundreds of thousands of new urban homes.  The Government documents fire the starting gun on its Future of Mobility Grand Challenge, which aims to make the UK the world leader in the movement of goods, services and people.  The work is all part of the Conservative administration\u0026rsquos Industrial Strategy and, said the Department, it could help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, make travel safer, improve accessibility, and present enormous economic opportunities for the UK.  As part of this, the Government today also confirmed more than \u0026pound12m for six projects working on simulation and modelling to aid the development of Connected and Autonomous Vehicles. The capability, it explained, would be essential for developing, testing and proving the safety of the vehicles.  Jesse Norman, the Transport Minister, said: \u0026ldquoThe UK has a long and proud history of leading the world in transport innovation and our Future of Mobility Grand Challenge is designed to ensure this continues.  \u0026ldquoWe are on the cusp of an exciting and profound change in how people, goods and services move around the country which is set to be driven by extraordinary innovation.  \u0026ldquoThis could bring significant benefits to people right across the country and presents enormous economic opportunities for the UK, with autonomous vehicles sales set to be worth up to \u0026pound52 billion by 2035.  \u0026ldquoThis call for evidence marks just one stage in our push to make the most of these inviting opportunities, he added.  Today\u0026rsquos publication precedes a full Future of Urban Mobility Strategy, which is due to be published by the end of the year.  It coincides with the announced of the appointment of Ian Robertson, the Chief Executive of BMW UK, as Business Champion to help advise, shape and develop the Future of Mobility Grand Challenge.  He said: \u0026ldquoA transport revolution in the way people and goods move around will see more changes in the next ten years than the previous hundred.  \u0026ldquoAs the Future of Mobility Grand Challenge Business Champion, I\u0026rsquom looking forward to working with the Government to help the UK build on its existing strengths and capitalise on that opportunity.  The Department pointed out how changes in society had already changed the way people were travelling such as people driving less overall, fewer workers commuting, a growing elderly population and the number of people living in urban areas increasing.  As a result, the Government has used its call for evidence to outline trends which could shape the future of transport in the UK. These include -  *Cleaner transport. The Government has already outlined its intention for all new cars and vans to be effectively zero emission by 2040. Falling battery prices, improvements in electric vehicle technology and the development of alternative fuels are not only reducing emissions from existing modes of transport but paving the way for the uptake of new creations.  *Automation. Improved sensors, increased computing power and the exciting potential of artificial intelligence are leading to increased automation in transport. The Government has already said it expected to see fully self-driving cars on UK roads by 2021 and the benefits of automated transport could include increased safety, improved accessibility and better use of urban space.  *Data and connectivity. Internet-connected vehicles can not only link with each other, helping to avert congestion on roads but also traffic lights and motorway signs. This could not only reduce traffic but also improve air quality.  *New modes. UK cities are already pioneering the use of drones to support emergency services and improve infrastructure inspections. But the introduction of aerial passenger vehicles could also appear in urban areas, while the lines between taxis and buses could blur, with more on demand transport.  *Shared mobility. More use of shared transport could reduce congestion and emissions and examples are likely to include commercial ride sharing, car rental services where users rent from one another and shared use bikes.  *Changing consumer attitudes. Technology is also changing the way people expect to be able to travel with more users expecting to be able to plan, book and pay for transport through their phones.  *New business models. New business models are beginning to emerge, such as Mobility as a Service. Maas can make payment easier, provide better real-time information and allow passengers to book multiple modes of transport with just one click."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-told-by-italys-matteo-salvini-to-be-tough-with-brussels-or-face-being-swindled","story":"  Right-wing populist Matteo Salvini insisted the Prime Minister should be prepared to walk away without a deal, saying: \"On some principles there is no need to be flexible and you should not go backwards.\"  Mr Salvini, a former MEP who has clashed with the EU since entering government earlier this year, spoke as Mrs May faced pressure from senior Conservative Party figures not to cede any more ground to Brussels.  Her Chequers Plan sparked the resignation of Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary and David Davis as Brexit Secretary, and while party figures have supported it, some have warned it should be a line in the sand rather than a flexible starting point for negotiations.  Mr Salvini, leader of hardline anti-immigrant party the League, said there was \"no objectivity or good faith from the European side\", adding: \"My experience in the European Parliament tells me you either impose yourself or they swindle you.\"  His hardline comments to The Sunday Times came after the PM and senior ministers embarked on a series of visits to EU27 countries in an attempt to get backing for her Chequers Plan.  On Thursday, the Brexit blueprint was dealt a severe blow by Brussels when Michel Barnier, its chief negotiator, rejected the customs proposals that form a key plank of the UK Government\u0026rsquos White Paper.  On Friday, Mrs May received a welcome boost after Austria agreed that Brexit would be among topics for discussion at a forthcoming informal meeting of EU leaders.  Downing Street said Chancellor Sebastian Kurz agreed that Britain\u0027s departure from the EU would be on the agenda for the European Council being hosted by his country - which currently holds the EU presidency - on September 20.  It means the PM has an extra gathering of leaders to try to convince them to support her Brexit plan after a week in which ministers have been deployed to various capitals to woo senior politicians.  The next meeting is a gathering of EU leaders in Brussels in October, by which time it is hoped a Brexit deal will have been hammered out.  Meanwhile, Mrs May has been backed by her local Conservative Association chairman.  Richard Kellaway said the Maidenhead branch \"fully supported\" her plan and he had been impressed by a briefing on it for association heads in Downing Street.  \"Most of us found it quite persuasive and convincing. We have received little criticism from our members. I\u0027m of the group of people who feel that it is not a great deal but it is not bad. We have to actually have a deal,\" he added.  However, Mr Kellaway was earlier quoted by The Sunday  as warning: \u0026ldquoIf it were to be diluted it would ultimately not be acceptable.  Elsewhere, Lawyers for Britain said that the Chequers Plan would mean UK courts would continue to be ruled by the EU.  Its Chairman, Martin Rowe, accused the PM of a \u0026ldquowholesale abandonment of her promises made in the Tory manifesto and in her Lancaster House speech.  \u0026ldquoWithin the common rulebook areas at least, it is quite clear that the interpretation of the laws applying within the UK will continue to be carried out by judges in Luxembourg with judges in the UK having only a subservient role, he said."},{"url":null,"title":"michael-russell-signals-scots-government-considering-stockpiling-medicines-in-event-of-no-deal-brexit","story":"  The UK Government has already made clear that it is making contingency plans to maintain supplies of food and medicine in the event of a no-deal, stressing how the public should be comforted and reassured that it is doing so.  At the weekend, Sir Michael Rawlins, the UK\u0027s medicines regulator, warned that failing to get a Brexit agreement with Brussels could spark drugs shortages, including insulin, which millions of people, including Theresa May, need in order to maintain their health. Sir Michael pointed out how, in terms of insulin: \"We import every drop of it.\"  It is believed that insulin is among the medicines the UK Government is now considering stockpiling.  However, in Scotland, health care is devolved and Michael Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Brexit Secretary, made clear: \u0026ldquoWe do not know what plans or assumptions the UK Government are making but we will do everything we need to do and take whatever practical action is required should we have to.  His remarks came as reports claimed the armed forces were on standby to help distribute medicines, food and fuel to vulnerable communities if Britain were to crash out of the EU without a deal.  The pro-EU Labour peer Lord Adonis said: \"Having our nation\u0027s defenders on stand-by for a no-deal Brexit just shows the radical lengths this Government will go to, to force through its extreme agenda.\""},{"url":null,"title":"ken-smiths-diary-got-his-number-out-to-grass-hey-jack","story":"  BIG problem in Scottish prisons just now is the number of hidden mobile phones.

Says Jack: \"I volunteered to review the concert. I was a really keen guitarist myself but when I saw Hendrix take the stage and open up with Sgt Pepper\u0027s my head exploded.  \"I rushed back to the office and I seem to remember the thrust of my review was, \u0027I have seen the future of rock n\u0026rsquo roll.

Following its March launch at Mackie’s of Scotland’s 19.2 parlour, fans had been going nutty for the ever-flowing tap, consuming more than 5kg in the first week.                                                    But the Aberdeen parlour has now said goodbye to the dessert topper – which was being outperformed by its neighbouring ever-flowing chocolate tap, dispensing Mackie’s own milk chocolate – made just 19.2 miles away on the family farm.                                                    Yvette Harrison, Manager of Mackie’s 19.2 in the city’s Marischal Square, said: “In some ways it’s sad to say goodbye to the peanut butter tap. It really did create a buzz online and off and gave customers an extra special element to top their desserts with.        “It’s one of those naughty treats that actually has health benefits, and fans were going nuts for it when it launched in March.“However, we have chosen to replace the tap as we want to ensure that enjoyment of the parlour is available to all. When we learned that it was putting off some of those with severe nut allergies we made the decision to phase it out and replace it.”The Willy Wonka-style tap, which dispensed warm, smooth peanut butter for topping waffles, ice cream and crepes was a hit with customers looking to add a savoury element to their sweet treats.Viral videos of the UK-first tap racked up nearly 3million views on the likes of LADBible and UNILAD.                                                                                                        Although the departure of the tap will come as sad news for many nut butter lovers, those looking for a new topping for their desserts won’t have to wait too long, as Mackie’s is close to finalising the tap’s replacement flavour.Yvette added: “I don’t want to give too much away just yet, but for many this will be a taste of their childhood and an all-round favourite for waffles, crepes and sundae scoops.“The new tap could well be ready to go in the next week so make sure you head down to the parlour and be one of the first to try our new creation.”In addition to the success of the taps, Mackie’s is also on course for their most successful summer of sales ever.                                                                                                        The family firm recorded its strongest ever ice cream sales in its 30-plus year history in May – a figure surpassed in June, thanks to the warm summer and growing export sales.Mackie’s of Scotland produces luxury ice cream at its fourth-generation family farm in Westertown, Aberdeenshire. The company started producing ice cream in 1986 using milk and dairy from its own herds. Mackie’s distributes its products to the UK and worldwide.                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"use water wisely urges council","story":"        Aberdeenshire Council has called on the public to use water wisely as the warm, dry weather continues across the area.                The council says here is increasing pressure on water supplies and forecast rain is not expected to replenish supplies sufficiently.                                                    Aberdeenshire Council and Scottish Water are continuing to provide support to a number of properties experiencing water shortages and are encouraging everyone to use water wisely.                                                    Both agencies are working with the Scottish Government to provide bottled water and tanks to those in the area whose private supply is running dry, at no cost. Council teams are already dealing with requests relating to around 40 water supplies, serving around 60 properties, a number which is expected to increase.        The council has delivered, or householders have collected, 2,500 1.5 litre bottles of water. Fifteen 1,000-litre bowsers have been issued and filled by the council, which will be refilled as required. There are more than 7,500 private water supplies in Aberdeenshire – the highest number in thecountry.Given the limited capacity of the council, priority is being given to elderly, disabled or ill occupiers and householders may have to augment the supplies the council provides with water from other sources. More bowsers are being delivered this week and farmers concerned about their livestock are beingadvised to submit requests direct to Scottish Water.                                                                                                        Significant rainfall over a prolonged period is required to replenish some supplies, but this is not expected in the near future. There are warnings that when rain does fall, private supplies could become contaminated and users should be wary.Users of untreated supplies should ensure they boil water before drinking, cooking and brushing teeth. Those using such supplies may be eligible for grant funding towards treatment – contact the council’s environmental health team for information.Long-term, the council is providing advice on future solutions to improve water security, such as support to help connect to the mains. If that is not possible, improvements to the current source or forming a new supply can be considered and grants may be available for some of this work.Environmental health team manager, Louise Cunningham, said: “Most people will be well aware of how recent weather conditions have been affecting the country, but those with private water supplies in Aberdeenshire are acutely aware of the impact it’s having.                                                                                                        “Clearly we all have to use water wisely at times like this, but around 11,500 properties in Aberdeenshire are served by private water supplies, by far the highest number of any local authority in Scotland, and difficulties for these residents could be pronounced.“We are assisting where we can and would encourage anyone who is having issues with their private supply to get in touch with us, both about short term solutions and thinking about the longer term.“When rain does come, users of private supplies should be aware that following an extended dry period the water will not be absorbed by the ground quickly and has the potential to run over ground for longer, potentially contaminating some supplies.”If you need assistance in relation to water supplies, please contact the council by phoning 01467 539539 (during office hours) or by emailing: environmental@aberdeenshire.gov.uk Some useful advice from Scottish Water is also available online: http://bit.ly/2K1CQ7s                                                                    "},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116798.jpg","title":"Caithness estate with links to royal family to be sold at auction","story":"A CAITHNESS estate with links to the royal family and rock and pop stars is to be sold at auction next month.The Dunnet Head Estate, comprising 1800 acres of land and the House of the Northern Gate, was initially put on the market in February for \u0026pound925,000.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for Auction House Scotland, which is dealing with the transaction, yesterday described the price reduction as \u0026ldquoone of our biggest ever.She said: \u0026ldquoSince the latest reduction on Friday the amount of interest in the estate has increased tenfold with enquiries coming mostly from the UK.Asked why the estate is being sold, she replied: \u0026ldquoThe current owner has had it for a long time and felt it was time to sell up and move on.The estate includes six lochs, a beach, approved planning for 10 timber lodges and a detached house as well as the 10-bedroom House of the Northern Gate.It was owned by Commander Clare Vyner and his wife Lady Doris Vyner, who was the Queen Mother\u0026rsquos close friend and lady-in-waiting. While staying there in 1952 the Queen Mother saw Barrogill Castle, purchased it and renamed it the Castle of Mey.She restored it and stayed there regularly from 1955 until her death in 2002. The castle has been open to the public since then and attracts 25,000 visitors a year.After the Vyners sold their property it was run as a hotel from 1967 until 1974. When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Monday 30 Jul 2018 5:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events. People with physical, vision and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete.\u0026ldquoThis is a golden opportunity for local groups, individuals and businesses to raise awareness to their cause and raise funds from their stalls on the day, he said. \u0026ldquoWe are hoping the event will showcase Caithness in a positive way for tourism, business and the community.Sixty para-athletes will travel from as far afield as America and Australia and all over the UK to take part in the milestone event. The Mey Games will be unique as it welcomes both para and Invictus athletes to compete in traditional Highland track-and-field competitions.

There will be in the region of 15 marquees this year, including seven new ones as a result of successful applications to local community benefit funds.\u0026ldquoThe Mey Games is now a major annual event in Caithness, Capt Otley said.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos organised by the Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch of the RBLS who took on the running of the games when visitor numbers were dwindling to as low as just 30. Last year, we had 1500 visitors and this year we hope to welcome between 2500 and 3500 people.\u0026ldquoWe are all volunteers and work hard to ensure the event is a big success. It\u0026rsquos a community event and we want the local community to be part of it. We offer free stalls to local businesses as we want to encourage them to be involved.\u0026ldquoAt the RBLS we provide a lot of veteran support and our ethos is focused on military support and participation inclusion.\u0026ldquoWe are delighted to have so many para-athletes taking part this year from around the globe. A delegation from the RBLS Wick, Canisbay and Latheron branch visited Australia in April this year to mark Anzac Day so it\u0026rsquos fitting that we will have a number of Australian para-athletes taking part.\u0026ldquoWe want to make sure each of the para-athletes and everybody at the games has an enjoyable time.He stressed how the games have been \u0026ldquoramped up by comparing the number of marquees this year with the total put up two years ago, only three.\u0026ldquoThere has been a massive amount of work behind the scenes by a dedicated group of members to ensure the games not only takes place but grows to a more sustainable level.The build-up to the Mey Games will get under way with a North Coast 500 cycling challenge that will depart from Wick\u0026rsquos Market Square on July 28 and arrive back in the town on August 3, the day before the games.On the morning of the games, at 9.30am, there will be a rededication ceremony at the grave of General Lord Horne in Wick cemetery. \u0026ldquoWe shall honour Wick\u0026rsquos own hero of the Great War with a colour party and piper in attendance at this short but poignant event, Capt Otley said.Events kicks off at 11am and include Highland dancing competitions, pipe and drum bands, the tug of war, dog show and live music, as well as various exhibitions, local art, crafts and food stalls.The event will take place at John O\u0026rsquoGroats for the third time after travel company Natural Retreats stepped in after the previous games location, close to the Castle of Mey, became waterlogged.Since then the company has continued to provide ongoing complimentary use of the showground.Ewan Kearney, chief operating officer at Natural Retreats, said: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted to support the Mey Games again this year.For more information, visit the Mey Games Facebook page: https://www.facebook/MeyGames/Monday 30 Jul 2018 5:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Monday 30 Jul 2018 5:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"We just werent at the races says Academy boss after opening day derby defeat","story":"DEJECTED Wick Academy manager Tom McKenna watched his side succumb to a 2-0 derby defeat to Brora Rangers and admitted: \u0026ldquoWe just weren\u0026rsquot at the races.Goals by Kyle Macleod on the stroke of half-time and Craig Campbell just before the hour mark gave Brora a 2-0 win at Dudgeon Park on Saturday in Steven Mackay\u0026rsquos first competitive match as player/manager.Rarely will you see a more one-sided game with a mere two-goal margin of victory, and after the final whistle McKenna admitted his team had been second best throughout.\u0026ldquoWe were lethargic, we were disjointed, there was no fluency in our game, he said.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to take anything away from Brora \u0026ndash they were by far the better team.

The organisation\u0026rsquos chairman, Tony Vandyke, says the money will be used to complete the first stage of an extensive revamp ahead of proposed further work in the next five years.\"We are going to use the money for things like replacing the handrails and changing the electrics and lighting,\" he said. \"These are vital upgrades.

The utility giant said underlying earnings at its generation and supply unit had soared by more than 300 per cent to £165.8 million in the six months to the end of June. It added that the  division had “recovered” from a poor performance in 2017.            Average customer consumption increased by 4 per cent year-on-year over the period, which was mainly due to cold weather from the Beast from the East around late February and March.            Customer numbers now stand at about 4.9 million, down from the five million reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.The latest figures come after the Big Six energy company, which is owned by Spanish multinational Iberdrola, increased prices in a move that hit some 950,000 households.The firm hiked its standard variable gas and electricity prices for around a third of its customers from 1 June, with impacted households facing an average increase of 5.5 per cent.ScottishPower attributed the rise to an increase in wholesale energy costs, alongside costs associated with upgrading meters and delivering electricity from low-carbon sources.The firm has been investing in wind power, having completed a £650m project to build eight wind farms north of the Border.            Over the first six months of 2018, ScottishPower also started construction on a major offshore wind farm in East Anglia, the East Anglia ONE project.Underlying earnings at the ScottishPower Renewables business rose 27 per cent to £205.1m while they nudged up 3 per cent to £399.9m at the SP Energy Networks division.The group has also completed the installation of one million smart meters. It is working with four installation partners across the UK, installing at peak 2,700 meters per day with a UK-wide workforce of more than 500 people.ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: “Everyone knows that installing smart meters hasn’t been plain sailing for suppliers. Challenges have been overcome, with more to face, but it is a major achievement to reach one million installations.            “The potential for customers to reduce consumption and save money is only one benefit. As the energy industry becomes fully digital in the years ahead, the new meters will be a vital cog in a smart network that supports electric vehicle charging, manages locally produced renewable energy and even the storage of electricity at home.”On the half-year results he noted: “All of our business areas are performing in line with expectations. Our investment in onshore wind last year has seen an increase in electricity generated, and excellent progress has been made on delivering the £2.5 billion East Anglia ONE project.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774174.1532601783!/image/image.jpg","title":"end of era as john menzies offloads distribution arm","story":"        Logistics group John Menzies has entered into a conditional agreement to sell its print media division Menzies Distribution to investment funds managed by \u0026#8220transformational\u0026#8221 private equity investor Endless LLP in a \u0026#16374.5 million deal.                It said the proposed disposal creates a global aviation services business “operating in a structural growth market and marks Menzies’ exit from the market for print media and retail logistics”, enabling it to expand in the structurally growing aviation services market.            The Edinburgh-based group was founded in 1833 with the opening of a bookshop on Edinburgh’s Princes Street, which began selling The Scotsman newspaper over the counter and Menzies became known for retailing and wholesaling.            As part of the disposal, Menzies will retain a 10 per cent equity stake in the business, while Menzies Distribution will be responsible for the funding of Section B of the Menzies defined benefit pension scheme, which represents 17 per cent of the assets and liabilities of that scheme as at 31 December.John Menzies chairman Dermot Smurfit said: “I am delighted to announce today the sale of Menzies Distribution. In doing so we create a ‘pure play’ aviation services business that operates in a structural growth market and is very well-placed to take advantage of the many exciting opportunities that exist.”Upon completion of the disposal, which is subject to shareholder approval and expected to complete in September, Forsyth Black, currently president and managing director of Menzies Aviation, will be appointed chief executive of John Menzies and will be supported by Giles Wilson, chief financial officer and John Geddes, group company secretary and corporate affairs director.Smurfit added: “In his role as Menzies CEO, Forsyth Black will now focus on growing our market share in the aviation services market, increasing our operating margins and continuing to deliver excellent services to our customers.”The firm is set to report its interim results on 14 August."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4775528.1532886959!/image/image.jpg","title":"letter another scottish independence march so why does support remain the same","story":"        So another independence parade has taken place, this time in Inverness.

If another referendum were ever to take place, enthusiasts on both sides would campaign passionately, but it would entirely be a battle for the hearts and minds of maybe 300,000 waverers – soft Yes and No voters. The rest of us won’t matter much.             Blood and soil separatists may nod approvingly as indep­endence-obsessed marchers cross their TV screens. Yet Nicola Sturgeon and her spin-doctor team will realise these kind of demonstrations do little to influence the chances of Indyref2 taking place, nor enhance the likelihood of a result in her favour.

There is nothing better than a cracking fairytale when everything works out in the end with the main characters dancing into the sunset. Having overcome obstacles, barriers and nasty people, our wanderers sail away in a dream world of happiness and bliss. It warms our cockles and makes us feel all gooey inside. From Disney’s Cinderella to Tarzan to Shrek, good will win through and love will save the day.            And as always the baddie or villain gets his or her comeuppance and is cast aside. The villain learns his or her lesson and either falls off a cliff or eats lots of humble pie. But in the Brexit fairytale, the villain keeps winning and it’s spoiling the ending for me...            For many of you, Boris Johnson was a joke and a joker. He was happy to hang from a zip wire in London, ensuring all the press put his picture front of stage in the next day’s editions. He just loved the fact that his hair was literally all over the place and in need of some care and attention. It was and is messy and disheveled – all the time, making him look a bit clumsy and cute. He basked in the knowledge that the Tory-leaning broadsheet, The , would hire him at the drop of a hat to write his column, giving him that elevated platform he needed to point the finger at others. But, in this fairytale, Brexit Boris just will not leave us all alone to get on with the film. He keeps calling a halt to production. No, this baddie will not learn his lesson.I was one of those gullible idiots who swallowed the Brexit Bus slogans – hook, line and sinker. Hundreds of millions of pounds would come back to the UK each week and our NHS would swallow it up to keep this stalwart of British society prospering. READ MORE: |UK to stockpile food in event of no-deal BrexitAlong with Nigel Farage, Boris was front and centre in the Brexit campaign. It appeared these two characters were key to the plotline. They were partners in crime, but likeable rogues who were happy to swill a pint at the local village pub or get involved in some crazy prank. Were they the goodies or the baddies though? Then the unthinkable happened and we all woke up to the next instalment in our fairytale. These two had pulled it off.              Farage then did a runner. He has carved out a tidy media career with LBC in London. It is estimated that his media earnings are topping £700,000 a year. Well done Nigel. And who knows, Her Majesty may even honour him with that knighthood. It’ll be “Arise Sir Nigel”, as he distances himself from the nightmare he has helped create. But, this character is only now reduced to a sub-plot in our fairytale. The main protagonist and staring role goes to Boris. And I’m now convinced this baddie may be unstoppable.  No doubt the Tory grandees wanted him in power to give him a flavour of what it was like working with others. So, Mrs May was told to give him a seat at the table. The office of Foreign Secretary beckoned and he was completely unimpressive. Why? Because in this fairytale, he was plotting for more. He wants it all. He wants a shot at the title.My question to the screenwriters of our fairytale is this: Is the baddie not supposed to die or get trampled by rampaging wildebeest? Surely, you are not going to let the villain win the day?  No sooner had Johnson resigned, in what can only be described as a staged media directors cut, than he starts writing for the . The first thing he does is have a go at Sadiq Khan on London’s rising knife crime and violence. Now, let me see. How convenient is that Boris? A playing field you are comfortable in and very newsworthy to boot.            READ MORE: Two thirds of young Scots believe Brexit will be ‘bad’But, if we can just get back to the main plot. The one you, Boris, created and we are all suffering from as a result – Brexit. You cannot just whitewash yourself out of this one, hoping that some other patsy will pop up and take the blame. No, you wanted it, you sold it and now you need to run with it! We want a happy ending, Boris, and only you have the answer. After all, you had the answers 18 months ago...Does it feel like I’m being a bit accusatorial? Am I being too harsh on this Boris character? Are there other baddies in the background pulling his strings and writing the ending of our fairytale?This is our reality today as we prepare for a no-deal Brexit, WTO rules and a whole raft of sub-plots that we have not even considered. And we Scots are powerless to intervene in any way. The First Minister has tried. To be fair, Nicola Sturgeon must be sick to her back teeth of this baddie, wondering how she can have him written out of each scene. But, like Dr Legg in Eastenders, he keeps coming back.I’m afraid folks, there is no happy ending to our fairytale. Boris will make sure of that. Just as the world is burning, this baddie wants the hot seat, so he can rule and fulfil his potential and and make Boris 2, Boris 3: This Time it’s Personal, etc. It’s his movie and sequels and we are all bit-parts.              I wonder if he wakes up in the morning and sings that Lion King song, ‘I just can’t wait to be king!!’ The only problem with all of this is our fairytale has been turned upside down. Maybe it’s time we all left in search of Narnia. I hear the weather is a lot cooler there."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4775541.1532889211!/image/image.jpg","title":"ex scottish mp peter duncan rejects tory dark money claims","story":"        A former Scottish Conservative MP has resigned as a trustee of the organisation at the heart of claims that \u0026#8220dark money\u0026#8221 was used to finance Tory election campaigns, but insisted that critics had exaggerated the controversy.                Peter Duncan revealed he quit his role at the Scottish Unionist Association Trust (SUAT) ten days ago because he wanted “more separation” between its work and his role as a lobbyist.            But he denied the trust was being used to conceal the source of political donations, and said the nearly £319,000 given to Tory campaigns over 17 years had been generated from the “historic proceeds of raffles and tombolas”.            Political opponents have urged Ruth Davidson to reveal the source of the donations after the scale of financial support emerged.Under electoral law, unincorporated associations are not required to register with the Electoral Commission or declare where they receive their money from provided they donate less than £25,000 per calendar year to political parties and candidates.The elections watchdog has said it is reviewing whether SUAT has “complied with their reporting requirements as set out in law”.An investigation by the Ferret website revealed that between April 2001 and February 2018, SUAT donated £318,876 to the Conservatives. At last year’s general election, the trust made donations to the campaigns of Tory MPs John Lamont, David Duguid and Douglas Ross.Mr Duncan, who served as MP for Galloway and Upper Nithsdale from 2001 to 2005, told the BBC: “The suggestion that this is in some way dark money is a bit like suggesting the WI is some KGB front organisation. This is historic proceeds of tombolas and raffles throughout the west of Scotland going back 50 years.            “They were transferred into a trust with the express purpose, not of spending it, but actually investing it long-term.“And that’s what the trust has done since about the time I was born. It has invested that money with the objective of growing its capital base and making some of the proceeds available on a semi-regular basis to the party’s campaigns.” He added: “I was satisfied, and remain satisfied, that the trust is a permissible donor and that this is in no way dark money.”Theresa May said all donations to the Scottish Tories had been “accepted and declared in accordance with the law” when the SNP’s Westminster leader Ian Blackford challenged her over the issue at PMQs earlier this month.SNP MP Pete Wishart claimed last week that “serious questions are now piling up at Ruth Davidson’s door over the dark money that is funding the Scottish Tories”.            The Scottish Conservatives have said the party “always works closely with the Electoral Commission on the permissibility of donors”."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774013.1532550395!/image/image.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing sensation ed balls on his newest tv show","story":"        Ed Balls is discussing the dos and don\u0026#8217ts of donning a leotard.                No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?

One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure.

That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"communities minister makes isles her first port of call ","story":"\nCabinet secretary Aileen Campbell pours soap mixture into a mould under the watchful eye of Louise Jamieson.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with 14 women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday.\n issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/001WH1307NCA.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not currently exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27429  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\nSpeakers at today\u0026#039s march urged attendees to make their way to Belfast over the next week to celebrate Belfast Pride, who will host Ireland\u0026#039s biggest LGBT festival, with the annual parade held on Pride Day which is celebrated on August 4th.\nSinn Féin were among the thousand strong crowd of people who marched at the first ever Transgender Pride parade that took place in Dublin this afternoon.\n The march started outside Liberty Hall and made its way to Fairview Park, where Declan Flynn was murdered by a gang of five so-called “queer-bashing” teenagers in the early hours of September 10th, 1982.\nThe suspended sentences for his attackers triggered a long march towards equality in Irish society.

The difference these dogs can make to a person’s life is not quantifiable. \n  \n“They are a an invaluable safety tool and a wonderful companion.\n  \n “It takes around \u0026pound56,000 to train each dog so you can see that there is a great need for support from the public,” he said.\n  \nBrian concluded: “I would like to thank ecverybody who supported the walk both physically and financially. \n  \n“I’d especially thank the Antrim and Ballymena Guide Dog Volunteers for their great support and I have to applaud the ‘route manager’, Terry Hasson for all his behind the scenes work and dedication to the event.\n  \nA ‘just giving’ page is in operation allowing members of the public to make contributions online.\n  \nSimply do a google search for ‘Just Giving - the docs 50 mile walk’.\n  \n Meanwhile, tickets will soon be available for a concert featuring Liam McLaughlin which is due to take place on Friday, August 24 at the Michelin Club.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

It’s important that we show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and send a clear message that inequality and discrimination of any kind is simply not tolerable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAfter the meeting the DUP issued a statement accusing Sinn Fein of hypocrisy.\n\n“The DUP outrightly condemns any act of hate or violence against any member of the community.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDeputy Lord Mayor, Paul Duffy\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“The motion before the Council on Monday night was divisive as there was a significant element of hypocrisy given that Sinn Fein proposed a motion which focused heavily on hate crime, yet the IRA, which by Sinn Féin’s own admission has been inextricably linked to that party, committed some of the most heinous crimes during ‘The Troubles’ for which members of IRA have not been held responsible. \n\n“The families of victims of IRA violence deserve the greatest respect and the ultimate show of remorse for crimes committed against these victims by the IRA would see Sinn Fein ask specifically that those members of the IRA who committed murder and other acts generated by hatred, come forward to face the courts. All other attempts at deflection under the so called banner of ‘equality’ by Sinn Fein will be highlighted by our DUP council grouping.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The motion appears to have been submitted very late in the day and the implications of such a motion are far reaching. Due process hasn’t been followed, no call for an equality impact assessment as is custom and practise when displaying flags and emblems and we are going against our policies and procedures.\n\n“We as a party fear that this result will open the floodgates for all groups to suggest flying all types of flags from civic buildings, we would argue very strongly that official local authority flagpoles should only be used to fly the nation’s flag or indeed the armed forces flag which incorporates the Union Flag. \n\n“These are the reasons we objected in the strongest possible terms to any other flag being flown and are somewhat dismayed and astounded that only the DUP and Independent councillor David Jones voted against such a haphazard and unprofessional approach. We will on this occasion have to consider taking legal advice and utilising the call in process.”\n\nFollowing the meeting Cllr Jones said: “I opposed the Notice of Motion. My reasons were quite clear. I have no issue or problem with the LGBTQ+ community. Where I have a major problem is such a motion being proposed by Sinn Fein while over a period of thirty years their military wing, PIRA, carried out the most heinous indiscriminate murders on people no matter their sex, religion, colour, age or sexual orientation and have to date offered no remorse or apology for their actions. I do not believe Sinn Fein should be seen as s of minority groups, no matter who or what that group may be.\n\n“During a fractious debate members of Sinn Fein attempted to shout me down. They went as far a proposing a Motion of Censure on me to stop me from speaking at the meeting but following a vote this Motion failed.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“At the close of the debate and despite a rejected amendment being proposed the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion was passed. I and the DUP voted against while the UUP did not vote.\n\n“Once again I feel this shows the desperation of Sinn Fein to latch onto an issue they believe will show them to be the defender of a minority. No doubt they will say I am biased against the LGBTQ+ community. I totally repudiate this. I have worked with, socialised and have friends from the LGBTQ+ community. When I spoke to some of them before last nights meeting and I explained my reasons for not supporting the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion they were equally scathing of it saying they did not want to be used by a political party to bolster their image.”\n\nCllr Catherine Nelson proposed Cllr Jones be censored but this failed due to support from both UUP and DUP members. \n\nCllr Duffy said: “His disregard for the authority of the Mayor fell well short of the behaviour expected from members in the chamber.\n\n“In dredging up the past he used it as an excuse to deny this gesture of solidarity to members of the LGBTQ+ community. I am delighted our motion passed despite his opposition. We will be the first council in the North to fly the rainbow flag and that is something to be proud of.\n\n“I urge members of our local LGBTQ+ Community, and their families, to join me this coming Tuesday night for a celebratory event during Pride Week in Craigavon Civic Centre 7-9pm.”\n\nThose who are interested in attending the event are asked to contact the Lord Mayor’s Office on 028 3752 9633 as they need to know numbers for catering purposes.\n            \n

agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8578786.1532509495!/image/image.jpg","title":"nikita in the frame in specsavers contest","story":"\nDromore woman Nikita Harron is in the frame to be crowned Spectacle Wearer of the Year after making it through to the regional finals of the Specsavers popular annual competition.\n\n                \nNikita. who is a customer of the Lisburn branch of the opticians, was chosen from thousands of proud glasses wearers as a finalist for the nationwide competition.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nNikita, who is shortlisted in the 16 - 24 category. could follow in the footsteps of last year’s Award winner, Love Island hunk Alex Miller, winning £10,000 and the chance to mingle with the stars at the annual Spectacle Wearer of the Year Awards. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nShe was recently invited to the Lisburn store to a bottle of champagne, a certificate and a £125 glasses voucher.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\n“Hearing that I was shortlisted for my category was fantastic.

And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"internet sensation set to go on stage","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA WEST\n Belfast comedian whose parody of chart hits from the likes of Ed Sheeran – which has seen him go ‘viral’ on the internet – is about to headline his own show such is the demand to see him live.\nBrooke’s Paddy Rafferty, known to fans as Paddy Raff, will perform at the Foundry Club, formerly the Stiff Kitten, in the city centre on Friday July 27. The 34-year-old told the Andersonstown News how he had always been performing skits and his own take on songs throughout the years and decided that 2018 was his year to try his hand at stand-up.\n“Even back at school I would always try and change the lyrics of songs, whatever was popular at the time. The ability to flip lyrics dead quick always came naturally to me,” he said.\nPaddy explained how he started to play guitar in his teens and began to use his talent to create comedy videos which he has since posted on his social media Facebook page and which now have received thousands of hits.\n“I have my own take on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Galway Girl’ – I do ‘Broadway Girl’ and instead of Fountains of Wayne’s ‘Stacey’s Mom’ I sing about Stacey’s Ma. I’ve only really been performing since March but it has really taken off and it’s going really well.”\nPaddy said he is really looking forward to performing at The Foundry – which is already approaching a sell out.\n“I have always been a big fan of Billy Connolly, who funnily enough used a guitar as well in his early gigs. I’ve always loved stand-up comedy and never for a minute thought I’d actually be up there doing it myself.\n“It’s great to know that people will be coming next Friday to see and hear my stuff, I’m not being complacent, I’m putting the work in so it’s going to be a great night for everyone coming along.”\nPaddy will play The Foundry on Friday July 27. A limited number of tickets are still available priced at £8.\nFor more details on Paddy and his upcoming gigs follow www.facebook/paddyraff\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Paisley-tears.png","title":"mp ian paisley suspended for","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nDUP\n MP Ian Paisley has been suspended from the House of Commons for 30 sitting days – his party immediately also suspended him for an unspecified period pending its own investigation.\nThe North Antrim MP’s punishment follows his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government, following which he wrote to the then Prime Minister supporting the country in its bid to block a UN investigation of its human rights record.\nThe Seaker of the House of Commons described it as “a regrettable state of affairs”. A petition is to be opened ,which, if signed by 10 per cent of the North Antrim electorate will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley being forced to stand down.\nSir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, who delivered the findings, concluded that Mr Paisley was guilty of \u0026#8220serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute\u0026#8221.\nIn response, the DUP have suspended Paisley “pending further investigation into his conduct.”\nSinn Féin North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said the DUP cannot dismiss the fact that its Mr Paisley lobbied in defence of a regime with a shocking human rights record.\n “Much of the focus of the Ian Paisley scandal has revolved around his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government,” he said.\n“That is understandable given the focus on integrity in government following the DUP’s involvement in a number of scandals including RHI, Nama, Red Sky and dark money for Brexit.\n “These have all severely damaged public confidence in the political institutions but this latest scandal also calls into the question where the DUP stands on fundamental questions of human rights.\n“Amnesty International has said that serious human rights abuses were committed with impunity by the Sri Lankan regime during the conflict there.\n“Yet, after receiving his gifts from the Sri Lankan government, Ian Paisley actively lobbied the British Prime Minister to oppose a United Nations resolution to establish an international investigation into the human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n“Does the DUP leadership really believe that it is acceptable to dismiss the fact that one of its MPs lobbied in defence of a regime that carried out mass murder, war crimes and gross human rights abuses?\n“This is a litmus test for the DUP leadership and If Ian Paisley does not do the right thing and voluntarily resign, his party should compel him to do so.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ms decision to close lisburns bow street mall store described as a blow to city centre","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nSDLP MLA Pat Catney\n has said the loss of the M\u0026#038S Simply Food store in Lisburn’s Bow Street Mall is “a blow” to the city centre, to staff and shoppers.\nIn a statement Marks and Spencer said it had opted not to renew its lease on the Simply Food store but that no jobs were at risk with staff having been advised that all existing employees at the Lisburn branch will be redeployed.\nThe closure of the food store, which has been open ten years and employs 40 staff, will further add to the many already shuttered and empty retail slots in the complex following the liquidation of its anchor tenant BHS.\n“Any loss of business in Lisburn is a drain,” said Mr Catney. “Any business closure makes it more difficult for retailers to build their product up,” he said. “It’s the old saying – there’s no point going to market if there are only two stores in it. We need to be working to lift, build, Lisburn city centre up together.”\nMr Catney told Daily Belfast that the issue of paid city centre parking is taking a heavy toll  as shoppers are choosing to travel and spend their money elsewhere.\n“I personally don’t like the paid parking from a trading point of view, the parking attendants are very, very strict and I’m calling upon the city centre management from us as MLAs to really look at a strategy that will lift where we work in the city.”\nMr Catney described as “disappointing” the fact the Belfast Rapid Transit (BRT) scheme was not rolled out to Lisburn. “You have this Glider bus running from West to East in Belfast that could’ve pulled on out here. This is a commuter town, there are so many developments being built here with a lot more young people and families moving here so I would’ve liked to have seen that considered.\n“I will be contacting Translink over the coming days to request that bus services to Sprucefield shopping centre are frequent enough for those consumers who previously used to shop at M\u0026#038S in the town centre.”\nThe M\u0026#038S Simply Food store is expected to close its doors in the autumn. \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"}]
