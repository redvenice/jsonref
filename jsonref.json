Billionaire tycoon Stephen Ross\u0027 many companies include Equinox and SoulCycle         Various celebrities have cited the fundraiser and announced boycotts of SoulCycle and EquinoxAll this is part of a wider, deeply sinister theme about the hard millennial left that suggests they feel entitled to shame and abuse anyone who supports Trump.A few days ago, Democrat congressman Rep. Joaquin Castro from Texas named and shamed 44 Trump donors in his state, accusing them of ‘fuelling a campaign of hate’.By doing so, and including the names of all their firms, he wanted these people punished, professionally and personally.He made them targets for abuse, and possibly violence.When news broke that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, 77, had broken his shoulder in a fall on Sunday night, enraged liberal protestors raced to his home in Kentucky to scream ‘F*ck you, f*ck your wife, f*ck everything you stand for!’They proudly broadcast their actions on Facebook Live.We’ve seen female White House officials like Kellyanne Conway and Sarah Huckabee Sanders horribly abused, physically assaulted, and thrown out of restaurants.Yet the people doing all this vile stuff are the same people who profess to hate Trump because he is so ‘intolerant’.The truth is that there is nothing more intolerant than the modern American hard millennial left as represented by the likes of Chrissy Teigen.They furiously preach ‘compassion, empathy and humanity’ yet have none themselves.And their own moral self-righteousness is of coursed riddled with rank hypocrisy.Ms Teigen and her celebrity friends all enthusiastically supported Barack Obama in fundraisers despite the fact he deported 3 million immigrants, broke all US presidential records for dropping bombs, and kept illegal torture center Guantanamo Bay open throughout his presidency despite making its closure a key campaign pledge in 2008.I have no problem with Chrissy Teigen cancelling her accounts with Equinox and SoulCycle.In fact, I’m delighted that this will now reduce the chance of me finding myself accidentally stationed next to her irritating little PC-crazed face on a spinning bike.But I do have a big problem with her and her multi-millionaire celebrity pals trying to destroy the jobs of so many hard-working young people working at these gyms just because she doesn’t agree with the political views of a man who owns the parent company.It’s a new kind of fascism, and it’s disgusting."},{"url":null,"title":"JAN MOIR imagines secret diary Summers summer love","story":"Share this article Chapter 7: Just mucking about  Paul\u0027s orce from his wife comes through.

And I\u0027m still very religious. I thought if you had sex outside marriage, you\u0027d be struck down by a bolt from the sky. So I basically married all my bloomin\u0027 boyfriends. Or most of them.\u0027She doesn\u0027t want this piece to be about her disastrous love life, she insists, but it is quite a car crash, though she seems to have suffered amnesia with some of the details.It turns out there weren\u0027t just husbands, but other lovers and near-husbands. \u0027Do you remember the time you went on honeymoon, but didn\u0027t have the wedding,\u0027 says her friend Anne as we sit in Katy\u0027s kitchen and she wonders if she should open the gin.\u0027I don\u0027t think we should go into that,\u0027 Katy says.Husband number one was Amos. He\u0027d been a student at her father\u0027s school and it was a union \u0027everyone thought was suitable\u0027.Katy was 19, a virgin, excited about the prospect of this thing called sex she knew very little about. \u0027I learned fast. What a disappointment. I only discovered later that it could be quite nice. When I did learn that I was like a child in a sweet shop.\u0027Amos had been given a farm by his parents, and she could have been set up for life. But after two years, bored and frustrated, she walked out, taking the dog they had acquired.\u0027I swapped the husband for the dog,\u0027 she says breezily. \u0027The solicitor said I could get half the farm, but I\u0027ve never taken a bean from any of my husbands. All I took was the dogs.\u0027Next came the only husband she remains on good terms with — and whose surname she has kept.Jim Cropper was — and still is — a leading light in the sheepdog world. It was through him that she got involved in competing.This wedding sounds a bit more \u0027her\u0027. Under her wedding dress she wore wellingtons. Afterwards, the couple went to the pub.In her kitchen, there is a photograph of her with Jim, and a collection of dogs. Whether it\u0027s on display because she has fond memories of the husband or the dogs is unclear, but that marriage didn\u0027t work either.Marriage number three was to Albert, a huntsman. This one sounds like a riot.\u0027We got married during the hunt,\u0027 she says. \u0027But I managed to fall off the horse as it was standing still. I didn\u0027t have a dress for that one. \u0027I wore canary yellow jodhpurs, but they were so tight I didn\u0027t wear knickers because they would have shown. The trouble was, when I fell in the hedge, the jodhpurs split all the way up the back.\u0027She can\u0027t recall how long she was married to Albert. \u0027A couple of years was always my limit.\u0027 And you were always the one to leave? \u0027Yes.

Now a new generation of novelists are falling under their spellA witch is a woman who has too much power. Or, to quote the novelist Madeline Miller, a woman with “more power than men have felt comfortable with”. History teaches us that witches are dangerous and must be brought down, punished and silenced. Their wisdom and their force must be neutralised through interrogation, torture and execution. Yet these attitudes aren’t merely historical women continue to be persecuted for witchcraft in the world today. There has been a perennial literary fascination with witches they are, as Marion Gibson, professor of Renaissance and magical literatures at Exeter University says, “a shorthand symbol for persecution and resistance – misogyny and feminism in particular”. In a #MeToo world, where Donald Trump – a fan of the term “witch-hunt” – is US president, it is really no surprise that female writers are examining the role of the witch in new ways.Since Trump’s election, which inspired mass spell-casting by thousands of “resistance witches” (the selection of judge Brett Kavanaugh for the supreme court also led to a mass “hex-in”), there has been a slew of novels, poetry collections and anthologies with witchcraft as their theme. Things haven’t felt so witchy since the 1990s, when there was a glut of TV programmes such as Sabrina the Teenage Witch and Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and books and films on the subject. It makes sense: the women of my generation were girls then, and now we have come of age, and are shaping our own narratives, joining other female writers in grappling with perennial questions of power and agency.This year alone we have seen Lucie McKnight Hardy’s Shirley Jackson-esque novel Water Shall Refuse Them Elle Nash’s Animals Eat Each Other, a dark, obsessive coming-of‑age novella WITCH by Rebecca Tamás The Glass Woman by Caroline Lea (a rare look at male witch trials, set in Iceland). Then last year there was Circe, Miller’s reimagining of the story of the witch from the Odyssey. Shortlisted for the Women’s prize and soon to become an HBO series, the novel sees Circe, a victim of rape, turn men into pigs in a spell that Miller reframed as self-defence.In the opening of the fearless, transgressive poetry collection WITCH, readers are greeted with a “penis hex”. Later there are “spells” for exile, for online porn, for UN resolutions, all written in a voice that is radical in its freedom, evoking sensual imagery of earth, blood, sex and body as a way of unravelling femininity and its history. Tamás explores how an affinity with nature and a talent for herbal remedies were cast as something dark and evil, and how women resisted. In the poem “WITCH TRIALS”, we catch a glimpse of what underpins the desire, or need, for magic: “the witch tries to think about how it started maybe it was when a girl came home late at  night with half her clothes missing  maybe it was when the witch made beds in the cellar  for everyone coming to abort their unwanted babies.”Of course, the literary witch is nothing new. She has existed since storytelling began, from Circe, the first witch in western literature, to Hecate, Morgan le Fay, Baba Yaga, the Weird Sisters, the Wicked Witch of the West and Hermione Granger. At their worst, literary witches are stereotypical and derivative at their best they are symbols of resistance against patriarchy and the harnessing of feminine power.Rereading Jane Eyre recently, I was struck by how witchy it is. Not only is Jane referred to as such by Rochester (“How well you read me, you witch!” he says to her, also calling her an “imp”, a “sorceress”, a “sprite” and someone who “has the look of another world”), but she also has visions and premonitory dreams, consults what she thinks is a fortune teller, and paints strange symbolic paintings. These are fitting allusions when considering Charlotte Brontë’s depiction of the subtle power dynamics between Jane and Rochester. Jane is defiant and resisting of male control even in childhood, and as the novel develops, the balance of power shifts in her favour.Another famous literary portrayal of witchcraft, this time by a male novelist, is John Updike’s 1984 novel The Witches of Eastwick, written in part as a response to accusations regarding Updike’s male chauvinist depiction of women. Readers still don’t seem to agree as to whether it is feminist or, as it has been called, a “great misogynist novel”. Rather satirically, Updike’s witches, who can fly through the air and perform hexes, only gain their power when they get orced, though that doesn’t mean that they have lost interest in men: they are witches as seductresses, their power is carnal. They are also dangerous. “If you’re wired heterosexually,” the author once told Margaret Atwood, “women can be strange, elusive, and frightening to a degree.”In an interview not long before his death, Updike reflected on his inspiration for writing the novel: “The era in which I wrote it was full of feminism and talk about how women should be in charge of the world. There would be no war. There would be nothing unpleasant, in fact, if women were in charge of the world. So I tried to write this book about women who, in achieving freedom of a sort, acquired power, the power that witches would have if there were witches. And they use it to kill another witch. So they behave no better with their power than men do. That was my chauvinistic thought.”It seems rather feminist to me, at least more so than the witches I grew up with on television. “Updike wrote his witches as quite ambiguous figures, partly inspiring and partly villainous,” says professor Gibson. “But the 1987 film of the book presented them as much more glamorous, empowering women, part of a trend of young, sexy witches which continued throughout the 90s.”Thankfully, portrayals of witches are now nuanced again. In Water Shall Refuse Them, Lucie McKnight Hardy gives us the teenage Nif, who in the stifling summer of 1976 performs strange rituals as she grieves for her dead sister. McKnight Hardy, who is from Wales, tells me she was inspired by a local chapel minister’s autobiography in which he wrote about women in the local area who were performing witchcraft. “This really struck a chord with me: we don’t often think of witchcraft as being something of the present day – we tend to consign it to history – so the idea that there were still women practising black magic in the area where I grew up was deliciously intriguing.”There is a sense of the present in the work of Elle Nash, a founding editor of Witch Craft magazine, too. Though she was fascinated by the witches in Macbeth and cites Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein as an influence on her writing, her novel has more contemporary concerns, examining as it does a fraught relationship between a satanic tattoo artist and his girlfriend. She “drew influence from Anton LaVey’s Satanic Bible and the Nine Satanic Statements”, she says, “and wanted to see how they might apply in real time to a person who is just beginning to understand and explore herself in the face of the desires and needs of others.”The modern witch is anything but stereotypical, something a flourishing indie publishing scene has no doubt contributed to. “Now we often get witch-figures that are more complex: good and bad, female and male, straight, gay, non-binary and so on,” says Gibson. Tamás’s shifting approach to gender in her collection is a case in point.“Right now, witches feel especially relevant because we are in a moment of refiguring the possibilities of what a woman might be, in the wake of #MeToo and much else,” says Tamás, who also co-edited the anthology Spells: 21st-Century Occult Poetry. “Witches give us an image of virulent, unapologetic female power that escapes gender binaries and rigid structures.” That power is subversive, fluid and confronting, and it wants to put a spell on you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e256708e7be3ab54f3b85c83a289a9e269b17d1f/0_0_3538_2122/master/3538.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebde7a238cb988446a7e6f6ffe6edf26","title":"boost uk economy with higher wages and more days off report","story":"New Economics Foundation says putting money in workers’ pockets will raise productivityGiving workers more public holidays and raising their wages could boost the strength of the British economy, according to a report.The New Economics Foundation said that driving up the spending power of consumers would give firms a greater incentive to raise their productivity, as they could have greater confidence there would be demand for their products and services.The claim that putting more money in workers’ pockets and to give them more time to spend it comes as the UK struggles to improve the efficiency of the British economy as Brexit looms and after a decade of faltering gains.Coming ahead of the final bank holiday of the year in England, Wales and Northern Ireland before Christmas, the report was welcomed by John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor.Productivity is an economic measure of the efficiency of a workforce. It typically measures the level of output per hour of work, or per worker.A more productive workforce signals stronger growth and healthier public finances. Productivity gains are vital to economic prosperity because it signals that more is being achieved by workers in less time. Gains are typically achieved through advances in technology and increased skill levels within a workforce.In the UK, productivity growth has stalled since the financial crisis, putting it behind international rivals. The UK ranks fifth out of G7 leading industrial nations, with Canada and Japan having weaker levels of productivity. Germany is the most productive nation per hour, while the US is top for output per worker.Weak productivity is problematic because it signals weaker economic growth, therefore eroding the public finances. Without an improvement in productivity, economies miss out on increases in wages and living standards, putting further pressure on the welfare system and depressing tax receipts.Some industries are more productive than others. In the UK, manufacturing firms are among the most efficient, whereas the services sector operate at below average productivity.“This important analysis … shows only an ambitious plan for economic transformation, of the kind Labour proposes, will lift the UK out of the productivity crisis that the Tories have left us in,” he said.Productivity – economic output per hour of work – has failed to grow each year at the rates seen before the financial crisis. Boosting Britain’s productivity is an important target for the government through its industrial strategy, as improving the efficiency of the economy can help companies raise workers’ pay levels and drive up living standards.As part of efforts to improve Britain’s productivity track record, the foundation said the government should drive up the minimum wage faster than already planned and ramp up spending on public services by as much as £32bn a year by the mid-2020s.Workers should get a national weekly allowance worth £2,500 a year instead of the tax-free personal allowance, while the government should create a new body to provide guidance on raising the number of UK public holidays.British workers have among the fewest paid days off in Europe. The UK minimum is 28 days, while in the EU it ranges from 30 to 40 days.The thinktank suggested that years of austerity and weak wage growth had eroded demand, with an impact on UK firms’ investment plans.Alfie Stirling, the head of economics at the foundation, said: “Raising demand by putting more cash in the pockets of the UK’s poorest workers, while giving people more paid time off from work to spend it, should now be part of a radical mix of options for any government that is serious about increasing productivity in a way that works for people and society.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72251035b0a643c51eec2ba8818c85382af4424c/0_289_4333_2600/master/4333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3262f35fc40f8649e63f5c2a5d3a19c","title":"global trade disruption a symptom of deeper malaise us china","story":"Resolving US-China trade war is not enough to ward off what many fear is a looming worldwide recession It is only a matter of time until the escalating tensions between China and the US prompt many more economists to warn of an impending global economic recession coupled with financial instability. On 5 August, Bloomberg News said that the yield curve, a closely watched market metric, “Blares Loudest US Recession Warning Since 2007”. And Larry Summers, a former US treasury secretary who was also closely involved in crisis-management efforts in 2008-09, recently tweeted: “We may well be at the most dangerous financial moment … since 2009.”Many economists argue that resolving US-China trade tensions is the best way to avoid significant global economic and financial disruption. Yet, while necessary, this would be far from sufficient.Don’t get me wrong: the focus on the deteriorating relations between China and the US is entirely understandable. After all, their worsening dispute increases the risk of a trade war that, coupled with a currency war, would lead to “beggar-thy-neighbour” (that is, lose-lose) outcomes cascading throughout the global economy. As growth prospects deteriorated, debt and leverage issues would come to the fore in certain countries, adding financial instability to an already damaging economic cocktail. And with the US-China row now extending beyond economics to include national security and domestic political issues, the best-case scenario on trade is a series of ceasefires the more likely outcome is escalating tensions.Yet, when viewed in the broader context of the past decade, trade tensions turn out to be a symptom rather than a cause of the world’s underlying economic and financial malaise. In fact, an excessive focus on trade risks is deflecting policymakers’ attention from other measures needed to ensure faster and more inclusive growth in a genuinely stable financial environment.Policymakers must also contend with growing political pressure on central banks, the backlash against the inequality trifecta (of income, wealth and opportunity), the politics of anger, the growth of anti-establishment movements, the loss of trust in governments and expert opinion, regional economic and geopolitical tensions, the growing risk of financial instability, threats to long-term financial-protection products and a general sense of economic insecurity.As I argued in The Only Game in Town, all of these recent developments – and also, of course, the growing US-China tensions – are related in a meaningful way to two basic and persistent features of the global economy since the 2008 financial crisis.The first is the prolonged period in which economic growth has been not only too low but also insufficiently inclusive. As a result, growing segments of the population have felt marginalised, alienated and angry – leading to unexpected election outcomes, the rise of populist and nationalist movements and, in a few cases, social unrest.The second post-crisis feature is the persistent overreliance on the pain-numbing but distortionary medicine of central-bank liquidity, rather than a more balanced policy mix that seeks to ease the (mainly structural but also cyclical) impediments to faster, more inclusive growth. Monetary policy has not been very effective in boosting sustainable growth but it has lifted asset prices significantly. This has further fuelled complaints that the system favours the already rich and privileged rather than serving the broader population – let alone helping more disadvantaged groups.If both these features persist, the global economy will soon enough come to an uncomfortable binary prospect on the road ahead. At this “T-junction”, the current, increasingly unsustainable path will give way either to a much worse outcome involving recessions, financial instability and rising political and social tensions, or, more optimistically, to a pick-up in inclusive growth and genuine financial stability as the governance system finally responds to popular pressure.Moreover, the journey to the neck of this T-junction is increasingly uncertain. In particular, the protracted use of unconventional monetary policies has entailed costs and risks that have intensified over time. These include attacks on the operational autonomy of central banks, the excessive decoupling of asset prices from their underlying economic and corporate fundamentals, and systemic overpromising of liquidity to end users (particularly in the non-bank sector). Today, a policy mistake or a market accident could make the journey much faster and a lot bumpier.To avoid a nasty outcome for the global economy and financial system, China and the US need to resolve their differences in the context of a more comprehensive policy compact that also involves other leading economies (especially Europe).Efforts to revitalise free but fairer trade should start by addressing genuine US and European grievances vis-a-vis China regarding intellectual-property theft, forced transfer of technology, excessive subsidisation and other unfair trade and investment practices. And this in turn should serve as the foundation for a comprehensive multilateral effort to remove constraints on actual and potential growth.Such an initiative would include infrastructure rehabilitation and modernisation in Europe and the US, more balanced fiscal policies in Europe and a stronger regional economic architecture, stronger social safety nets around the world, and targeted liberalisation and deregulation in China and Europe.With concerted global action of this type, the world economy could navigate the upcoming T-junction favourably. Without it, current complaints about economic and financial instability and insecurity could pale in comparison to what comes next.• Mohamed A El-Erian is chief economic adviser at Allianz.

How much do I have in my bank account?” NatWest is to begin voice-only banking that will give customers direct access to their accounts by talking to the Google Home smart speakers now in millions of British homes.The trial – the first by a UK high street bank – will let customers ask Google “What’s my balance?”, “What’s my latest transactions?” and “What’s my pending transactions”. Google devices will answer verbally, and also flash the answers up on the customer’s smartphone.While only basic account information will be available under the trial, NatWest said the technology may in future allow customers to instantly transfer money and pay bills simply by talking to Google devices.To access their account, NatWest customers will have to say out loud two digits from a new four-digit password, in a move that will inevitably raise fresh fears about security and privacy.Last month, it emerged that Google contractors are able to listen to recordings of what people say to the company’s artificial-intelligence system, Google Assistant.NatWest said that customers would only be able to start quizzing Google after separately setting up voice banking through their existing online banking password and then obtaining a new four-digit voice pin which would be different from their debit card pin. It added that Google would not store the customer’s ultimate banking password. The trial will only run over Google devices, not Alexa or Siri.The bank admitted some customers may be put off by the prospect of their account information being broadcast across a room. “Other people in the area will be able to hear your balance, which is something you will want to take into consideration,” said a spokesman.Internet security specialists immediately raised concerns about voice banking. David Emm of Kaspersky said: “If people are able to carry out banking transactions using a smart speaker, it not only raises the issue of someone recording your voice and spoofing a transaction, but also the risk that recordings stored by the vendor of the device could be stolen by cybercriminals.He said that it was difficult to see what problem was solved by voice banking. “If every transaction requires a pin from the customer, to verify their identity, it rather negates the convenience of banking in this way.”NatWest believes the technology could revolutionise banking in a way not seen since the start of mobile phone banking, although it added that the mass roll-out of voice banking would only go ahead after evaluation of the three-month trial, involving 500 customers.Kristen Bennie, head of “Open Experience” at NatWest, said: “We are exploring voice banking for the first time and think it could mark the beginning of a major change to how customers manage their finances in the same way mobile banking made a huge impact.”The technology would allow customers to multitask at home – maybe ironing, cooking or cleaning – while at the same time checking their accounts. A video NatWest prepared for the launch of voice banking features a customer talking to their bank while making a cup of tea.The arrival of voice banking in the UK follows the remarkable take-up of smart speakers. There are now an estimated 9.6m Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa devices already in UK homes, with the number projected to top 12m this year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4218e2eb858e41d80de4b60fb989939e30fc0ba1/325_114_3161_1896/master/3161.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef1df351baeff51636951bda8f73b2c1","title":"oil producer saudi aramco makes 47bn half year profit","story":"The state-backed oil producer Saudi Aramco made profits of $46.9bn (£39bn) in the first half of the year as lower oil prices made a small dent in the earnings of the company that makes the world’s largest profits.The company produced 13.2m barrels of oil equivalent per day during the period, far above production from rivals such as ExxonMobil, which made 3.9m per day.The previously secretive Aramco lifted the lid on its financial performance for the first time at the start of April as it prepared to raise money on international capital markets. Investors placed orders worth $100bn for $12bn of bonds, the highest level of demand in history.The figures offered an unprecedented glimpse into the company long thought to be the largest in the world. They revealed that Aramco made $111.1bn of profits in 2018, on revenues of £355.9bn – well above those of other oil supermajors such as Royal Dutch Shell or ExxonMobil, and Apple, the world’s most profitable listed company. Apple made net income of $50.6bn in 2018, while Shell made £23.4bn.Aramco will broadcast a briefing on its results for the first time ever on Monday afternoon, at 2pm BST, as it increasingly looks to engage with international investors. The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman (or MbS), has made ersifying Aramco away from a dependence on oil production a key part of his plan for the next decade in the nation’s economy.The Saudi state is also planning to list shares in Aramco within two years in a float that could value the company at as much as $2tn. The float was pulled last year amid concerns that it may not achieve the hoped-for valuation.Investors appear to have put aside concerns over doing business with Saudi Arabia when subscribing for the record-breaking fundraising in April, which came after the international outcry over the murder of Jamal Khashoggi.

The owners all come from a background of members’ clubs and own several other “poncey pubs with rooms, I think is the official name,” laughs Brod. As a result, customer experience is key. “We’ve come at the wine world putting wine at the bottom and service at the top. Traditionally wine shops aren’t like that – it’s wine over everything else and they’re pretty intimidating. You walk in, get scared and choose whatever’s on the middle shelf,” he says.“We don’t want to be elitist here. Whether you’re a wine aficionado or just want a glass of something with a snack, our staff will look after you regardless. We’re a sociable environment, the lighting, the music and the welcome when you walk through the door it’s all very considered because hospitality is in our DNA. We want people to have a great experience that sticks with them. I almost want this to be a community centre, which sounds ridiculous but that’s what hospitality is ultimately about – community.”Brod is certainly achieving that wish, as every customer references the atmosphere and the people they’ve met over long lunches or cosy evenings in the snugs.“I don’t think I’ve ever sat on this sofa without everybody on it talking to each other,” says customer Soo Arber. “I’ve made a lot of friends here, including a girl who has recently moved to Bath and doesn’t know anyone. She came along with her glass of fizz we got chatting, ended up swapping emails and now regularly meet up. It’s a space where, particularly as a woman, you don’t feel intimidated by sitting alone, because it’s so friendly.”Fellow customers Anthony Christie and Simon Jones say the venue suits different moods. “If you want to socialise with new people, the sofa is a good place for that. We’ve met a lot of people there,” says Christie. “But then you’ve got the snugs downstairs, which are the perfect place to sit with a gang of friends and lose track of time.” As we chat, the waiter brings some salted almonds over. “They’re not on the menu any more but I know you love them,” he says, much to the pair’s joy. “That shows how personalised the service is here,” says Christie. “We have a relationship with all the guys who work here and they take pleasure in recommending wine and food that they know will meet our palates.”Christie and Jones are self-confessed wine buffs but Casey Ryder, Beckford’s general manager, says their customers are a broad range of people. “We’re very non-pretentious and get customers of all ages and walks of life,” he says. “We see lots of first dates but also older couples out having fun, whose kids come and pick them up afterwards.”He says the small plates menu makes it the perfect date spot. “Sharing plates takes out the slight intimidation of a long three-course meal with a huge bill at the end. Plus, if you decide you’re not into each other, you can leave after a plate of charcuterie. If things are going well you can have a whole meal and take it downstairs, which is much more intimate.”While the management team own other pubs and businesses, they view Beckford Bottle Shop as a business within a business – effectively a startup – and that is why they chose iZettle. “They are a genuine disruptor within the fintech industry. They offer something different and the level of customer service is excellent,” says Brod.“It’s incredibly easy to set up, there are no long contracts, as it’s all month by month, and it’s simple to add new machines. It’s all cloud-based, which is good, as we often do events so can take the machines with us. If I was starting any business I’d use iZettle. Card machines are the last thing you want to think about in a business, but also one of the most important. And I love that iZettle regularly check in and care about what we do, because that’s what our business is about: customer care. I like dealing with companies that share our ethos.”Another customer, Joanne Hodges, echoes Brod’s sentiment around customer service. “You don’t even need to look at the wine list here. I often tell them I fancy trying something new and they just know what you’re after. You don’t have to drink the same wine each time you visit, which gets boring. And I love the mix of people – I’ve met locals as well as people on holiday and everyone is lovely. I particularly like sitting at a table in the shop. It’s like being in a library surrounded by books, only with wine.”Brod says the key to the Beckford Bottle Shop experience is that it’s an evolving space. “You can come for coffee with your laptop in the morning, have a small plate and glass of wine solo, or meet with friends and put a lot of plates together for a full meal. We’ve seen it all: proposals, marriages, dates and affairs – the whole gamut. All the stuff of life goes on here.”So, whatever you’re looking to celebrate next time you’re in Bath, try this community centre with a difference.Explore the benefits of joining the iZettle community at izettle"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16bc79348bf77ab60829c8cdf91befd31212243b/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35f632f98d9a52037261d0e9801ba6c5","title":"cabinet women no deal brexit caroline lucas","story":"It is hard to remember a moment in my lifetime when Britain faced a greater crisis. A coup led by a small group of rightwing libertarians is all but complete, as the Vote Leave team has been reassembled and taken control of 10 Downing Street. They are set upon implementing the most extreme no-deal version of Brexit – and, most terrifyingly, we are running out of time to stop them.At times of national crises political leaders need to bring a country together. But that is not happening. The government is hellbent on creating more isions, scapegoating our friends and neighbours, and ignoring the inequality and democratic deficit that fuelled the Brexit vote.It is not only a crash-out Brexit that threatens our future. There’s the climate emergency too, and an unscrupulous leader would have no qualms about manipulating it to justify the sweeping aside of democratic guarantees and people losing their rights. We have to avoid this danger.Mending our broken democracy should underpin the response to both the Brexit and climate crises – with elected politicians setting aside our political differences in the national interest. When the 16-year-old Greta Thunberg visited Britain earlier this year I convened cross-party talks with her on how to end our climate emergency. The same degree of cooperation is needed to confront what’s happening in the name of Brexit.We need an “emergency cabinet” – not to fight a Brexit war but to work for reconciliation. And I believe this should be a cabinet of women.Why women? Because I believe women have shown they can bring a different perspective to crises, are able to reach out to those they disagree with and cooperate to find solutions. It was two women, Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan, who began the Peace People movement during the worst of the Troubles in Northern Ireland it was two women, Christiana Figueres and Ségolène Royal, who were key to the signing of the Paris climate agreement intractable problems have found the beginning of resolution thanks to the leadership of women.So I have reached out to 10 women colleagues from across the political spectrum at Westminster and Holyrood – Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, Labour, the SNP, Plaid Cymru, the Independent Group for Change and independent – asking that we join together to stop the dangerous pursuit of a crash-out Brexit.This is not an attempt to replace one coup with another. A small group of us should not be deciding on Britain’s future and that is not what lies behind my initiative. But we need to find a way forward that allows the British people to decide which course they want to take.To begin with that means denying Boris Johnson the reins of power through a no-confidence vote and establishing a national unity government. Political tribalism would likely scupper any moves that are just about putting Jeremy Corbyn in charge. So far the Labour leadership’s reaction has been to suggest they would not work in coalition with other parties, and politicians from some other parties have made clear that they would not serve under his leadership. A government of national unity must do exactly that – unite parties. And I believe that a cross-party cabinet of women has the potential to do exactly that.We then need to press the pause button in order to organise a confirmatory vote that offers people the choice of the status quo or pressing ahead with the latest government plan – whether that is a revised withdrawal agreement or, as seems more likely, a proposal to leave with no deal.It also means a commitment that, as politicians, we accept the outcome of that fair, transparent and informed vote, even if it delivers a result we do not agree with.I believe we can make this happen. I’m asking my colleagues to meet with me in the coming days so together we can transform the conversation about Brexit. So together we can find a positive way forward, revitalise our democracy, and stand up to this government’s reckless gamble with Britain’s future.• This article was sent as a letter by Caroline Lucas to Heidi Allen MP, Kirsty Blackman MP, Yvette Cooper MP, Justine Greening MP, Sylvia Hermon MP, Liz Saville Roberts MP, Anna Soubry MP, Nicola Sturgeon MSP, Jo Swinson MP and Emily Thornberry MP"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26aabbf870990e64e1b4adb755b34d88ba36637e/0_224_2063_1237/master/2063.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65c1326978f00450abd468f6476ce1ae","title":"the guardian view on stop and search not a solution","story":"Eight years ago this month, when Boris Johnson was mayor of London, the worst rioting Britain had seen in decades broke out in the capital, before spreading across the country. An estimated 20,000 people were drawn in, and 4,000 arrested. A subsequent study by the  and the London School of Economics found that “humiliating” stop and search was a key factor in anger towards the police. An independent panel appointed by the government to examine the unrest urged immediate attention to the issue, noting that it was cited as a major source of discontent by young black and Asian men.Now, stop and search is on the rise again. In eight of England’s largest forces, its use doubled in the two years to March 2019. Sajid Javid, then home secretary, nonetheless eased the use of section 60 powers – allowing officers to stop and search anyone in defined areas without reasonable suspicion – for several forces. The prime minister’s announcement on Sunday extends that pilot scheme across all forces in England and Wales.But if his approach speaks to concerns, it cannot answer them. Mr Johnson has reverted to a familiar and failed Conservative playbook of “hard on crime, hard on criminals” rhetoric. (His home secretary, Priti Patel, wants offenders to feel not just fear but terror).Like his pledge to create 10,000 more prison places, or his earlier promise to recruit 20,000 more police officers, his announcement reeks of electioneering. Unlike those, this handily comes without a price tag for the Treasury. So even if the government’s “fiscal headroom” disappears thanks to a no-deal Brexit, this policy will stand.Mr Johnson has glibly dismissed the criticism he expects from “leftwing criminologists”. Several police chiefs see stop and search as an essential tool. But plenty of others will question both the fairness and effectiveness of this strategy.An analysis of the Home Office’s own data found that black people in England and Wales were 40 times more likely to be searched under section 60 powers than white people – exacerbating the disproportion seen with regular stop and search. The damage to police relations with communities is evident and the policy counterproductive. The College of Policing notes that while some studies suggest an impact on crime, it is likely to be “small, highly localised and short-lived”, and that stop and search tends to be less productive the more that it is used.Last month, the outgoing chief of Bedfordshire police, Jon Boutcher, said extra officers were essential, but could not make up for austerity-driven cuts that had left disadvantaged children vulnerable to gangs, damaged the social fabric and must be reversed to reduce crime. He noted in particular those hitting mental health and youth services. Since 2011, when the riots broke out, the number of youth centres in London has fallen from 234 to 130 the number supported by local authorities across England has halved.Extending stop and search powers, while paying only lip service to tackling the causes of crime, is “a tried-and-tested recipe for unrest, not violence reduction”, as the shadow home secretary, Diane Abbott, warned – and as Mr Johnson’s own experience should tell him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecb16d727fcfd3935a037731f33bf69d393bc05f/0_283_5115_3070/master/5115.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c9d14ce3c7fd81085f95ccc66af2051","title":"rock sea meaing tel aviv beach refugee","story":"Near Tel Aviv beach in 1939, an almost mythical struggle took place between a desperate refugee and his saviour, my grandfatherThe rock rises out of the water about a kilometre from Tel Aviv beach. It is sharp and serrated, and only desperate hands – the hands of a drowning man – would dare to grasp it. From an outsider’s perspective, my perspective, the perspective of a woman standing on dry land, what happened on this rock is simply impossible. How on earth could it have supported not one but two men, for long, endless minutes, in a life or death battle?The year is 1939. The Mediterranean is deep and blue. Tel Aviv’s shores are under the control of the British mandate and British law has forbidden Jews from entering the country. Those who manage to escape Europe find Palestine’s borders closed to them. Ships are sent back to the continent – only for some of their passengers to find themselves in the Nazi death camps.The only hope, then, is illegal migration. At night, the refugees arrive some way off the coast. Hidden by the darkness, they slip out of the boats and attempt to reach the shore. The fear of being caught by British officers is secondary. For the refugees there is a bigger problem – few of them know how to swim.The Jews of Tel Aviv are keen to help their European brothers. In the middle of the night they sneak into the water. They are strong, they know the sea. They carry the newcomers on their backs. My grandfather was one of those good swimmers. He was an athletic high-school student, who found that he generally preferred smuggling refugees to studying for his final exams. But on one of these nights, he almost drowned.Reaching a boat, he loaded one of the men on to his back. The guy was around his age, he told me, thinner than a starved goat. Carrying him wasn’t supposed to be a problem. But as he started to swim, my grandfather realised he was sinking. The man on his back was skin and bone, but he dragged him down as if he was made of lead. “Are you carrying anything?” my grandfather cried. The guy nodded. “You were told to leave all luggage on the boat – do you want both of us to drown?”The refugee didn’t want them to drown, but at the same time he refused to let go of his bundle. That was when my grandfather, utterly exhausted, reached the sharp rock. “Look, you idiot, I’m not going to die for your family treasure. Throw the bloody thing into the water, and let’s get to land before the Brits catch us.”It was then that the refugee told him about the statue. He was an art student back in Europe. Before being separated from his family, he’d made a bust of his mother’s head. He couldn’t let it be lost in the waves, he said to my grandfather he’d rather drown.My grandfather wasn’t a big fan of figurative sculpture. He knew they had to get to the beach before sunrise, or they’d find themselves at the mercy of the border police. He decided the only option was to stun his charge with a punch, and then swim with him to land. But the man saw it coming. They started struggling. It turned out that the starved goat was much more powerful then he seemed. For a moment, my grandfather thought that the jagged rock would be the last thing he saw.“Stop it, you’ll get us both killed! All right,” he relented, “we’ll carry the damn thing with us!”I have no idea how they did it, but when the sun came up that morning, they were already on land, blending into the crowd to fool the British who would have had trouble telling the locals from migrants.I visited that beach with my grandfather more times than I can remember. And long after his death, I keep going back. For years I thought that my grandfather was the hero of this story. I was so proud of his extraordinary swimming skills, especially as I have the swimming abilities of a Persian house cat. It was only years later I understood that the real hero was the man he carried. The statue that my grandfather wanted him to abandon gave his journey meaning. As long as he kept the statue, it kept him from being reduced to “a refugee” – it reminded him of who he was.The Mediterranean was a graveyard for hundreds of Jewish people who tried to flee the second world war. Today, the water is the grave for others seeking refuge. And the people on the land still don’t want the people from the water to come in. As I look at this place – the beach, the water, the rock – I ask myself what’s worth drowning for, and what’s worth living for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a192b3a6503e784ceb62b1ce841737b2b55825de/0_181_3784_2271/master/3784.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a421b5ff2af6ab96b883abefafaeb7a","title":"vladimir putin west russian president 20 years","story":"There’s little hope of an improvement in relations so long as the Russian president’s 20-year reign continuesWhen Boris Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Putin prime minister on 9 August 1999, few Russians knew much about him. In early television appearances he came across as mousy, shy and awkward, a man unaccustomed to the limelight from which his previous career in the KGB had shielded him.But within weeks he revealed a character trait that would become the defining feature of his rule – ruthlessness. His first memorable phrase was his threat to wipe out terrorists “even if they’re in the shithouse”, and within weeks he had launched a terrifying war against separatists in Chechnya that would leave tens of thousands of civilians dead.Twenty years on, as Russia and the west teeter towards confrontation, it is hard to remember that Putin started out as an avowedly pro-western leader. George W Bush and Tony Blair rushed to glad-hand him, and Putin himself stood in the Bundestag proclaiming at length and in fluent German that Russia’s destiny was in Europe. But western leaders were appalled by his brutality in Chechnya, and by the first signs of his antidemocratic tendencies, which included his muzzling of critical television stations.Putin’s fatal flaw, it seemed to me, was his utter inability to see that there was a contradiction between being a ruthless autocrat at home, and the values of the western civilisation to which he (at least at that time) paid lip service.Some argue that he was never seriously pro-western, that the overtures masked ulterior motives and KGB-inspired schemes to dominate the world. But I think that is mistaken. When I worked as a consultant to the Kremlin in the earlier part of Putin’s rule, I had many meetings with senior officials and have no doubt that they regarded themselves as “western” and even as democrats.The problem lay elsewhere – in Putin’s inability to understand the west’s wariness and increasing hostility as his internal policies revealed him to be no democrat. I discussed this with his advisers: how can you hope to persuade the west you are a good partner if you refuse to properly denounce the Soviet era, if you crack down on protests and stifle the media? They could not connect the two. And so the west naturally grew more and more suspicious, and Putin in response grew first disappointed, then angry and ultimately downright hostile. Since that first pro-western phase, I think it is possible to distinguish three further stages of “Putinism”.The second began in about 2003 and peaked in February 2007, when Putin travelled to Munich to deliver a blistering attack on the United States’ pretensions to rule the world as “sole master”. He was annoyed that instead of reciprocating his gestures (including his help in the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan), the Americans had not only ignored his robust opposition to the war in Iraq, but were pressing ahead with plans for a missile shield that, in Putin’s view, together with Nato’s expansion, directly threatened Russia’s security.Phase three developed during the Barack Obama presidency, for four years of which Putin was nominally prime minister while remaining the key player in the Kremlin. He became furious with what he saw as the US’s “superiority” complex (one might also read that as a Russian inferiority complex), epitomised by Obama’s remarks that Russia was a mere “regional power”, and that Putin had “that kind of slouch, looking like the bored kid in the back of the classroom”. Russian leaders (not just Putin) do not go in for personal insults like that. And they have a strong aversion to being lectured about how to behave.Putin’s fury reached its peak at the time of the parliamentary elections in 2011, which were patently falsified and brought thousands into the streets in protest. He blamed the Americans for supporting the demonstrators – not just morally but materially too – and as soon as he was re-elected president in 2012 he began to declare the supremacy of Russian society and morality over the “decadent” and “genderless” west. This led to a foreign policy based on the notion that if the west will not accept us as equal partners, then we will simply assume that role for ourselves. One can see this philosophy in action again and again.If the west can invade Iraq with impunity – so Putin reasons – then Russia can help out its mate in Syria, President Bashar al-Assad. If the west thinks it can just drag Ukraine, with its centuries-long ties to Russia and strategic importance, out of Moscow’s orbit, then it can think again. If the west thinks it has the right to influence Russian affairs with its NGOs and funding, its constant propaganda and blatant support for the opposition, then how can it complain when we deploy a few internet bots to muck up your election processes? We are only doing what you have been doing to us for decades.This, I believe, is Putin’s current modus operandi. He regards what he does as a mirror image of what the west does to Russia and around the world. The irony is that, in burnishing his image as a strongman, he betrays his vulnerability. His paranoia about permitting free elections and his thuggish recent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters are evidence of his weakness. The more he entrenches, the clearer it becomes that he is terrified of losing control – and of the retribution that may follow. He has now created a police state that brooks no dissent, buttressed by a media that glorifies his every word in true Soviet style.There is little prospect of an improvement in relations so long as Putin remains in power. But in the longer term there is hope. The Russian two-headed eagle has always looked both west and into its own soul. The current situation is essentially one of those perennial lurches towards Russian exceptionalism or Slavophilism, and the pendulum will surely swing back. Most Russians – certainly in the intelligentsia and middle classes – remain western-oriented.Putin is still popular at home precisely because he has instinctively surfed the nation’s changing moods – reflecting both their desire to be part of the world from which they were shut off for decades, and their craving for respect and security. When he eventually leaves the scene, the west might bear that in mind. For even if he lacks Putin’s ruthlessness, his successor’s priorities will be pretty much the same.• Angus Roxburgh is the author of Moscow Calling: Memoirs of a Foreign Correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f21c1b5bca8bf4bec4edd247447f03c8c69acea3/0_0_3035_1819/master/3035.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2e21604dd3f699f896f876e102715876","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of lazy","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘lazy’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘lazy’.Share your photos of what lazy means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 14 August at 10am.

It’s usually the Palestine society, or the Islamic society, and I think that’s a clear route of allowing discrimination in our education system.”The government has agreed to an independent review of Prevent, in response to widespread concern that it fosters discrimination against people of Muslim faith or background and inhibits legitimate expression. “The Prevent agenda does not need a review,” said Ibrahim, “it needs to be scrapped”.Ibrahim, who was born in Sweden and is the daughter of Somali refugees who fled civil war, has previously spoken out against the media for portraying her as a “fanatical Muslim and a threat to British society” on the basis of comments she wrote on social media as a 16-year-old.In one she joked that if she was president she’d oppress white people “to give them a taste of what they put us through”. In another she said everyone should read the Qur’an. The backlash was devastating. “I suddenly felt unsafe in my own campus, in my own space,” she said.Ibrahim, who came to the UK at the age of 10 and was brought up in Bolton, said her adolescent comments were twisted to make them seem more sinister than they were ever intended to be, and in no way represented her views today.She said: “It was something that was blown out of proportion. I think people know and understand I’m a completely different person from the 16-year-old child that I was, who had no political training and no political education at all at that time.”Ibrahim said her experience was common among young people from Muslim backgrounds or people of colour who dared to step into the public sphere. “To me, what’s been the most upsetting thing is to see young people who would be incredible in these roles to not even think of running because of the backlash that I faced. If it had been any of my white peers or colleagues they would never have experienced that.”Ibrahim said she worried about putting herself forward as a candidate to lead the NUS after witnessing the experience of Malia Bouattia, the first Muslim NUS president, who was subjected to Islamophobic attacks and hate-filled trolling on social media during her tenure.She said: “When I was thinking about running, it was the biggest factor that was putting me off – the backlash and the vilification and all the horrors that would come with it. “But at the same time I recognise it’s not something I should be afraid to do and I want to be able to encourage young people – especially young girls that look like myself – to be able to come into these spaces and make decisions for the institutions they represent and be unapologetic for who they are.”Meanwhile, the Islamophobia directed at young women like Ibrahim continues. On Wednesday, she tweeted: “It doesn’t matter how frequent it happens, what the context is, where it happens or who the perpetrators are, I will always be racially profiled and discriminated against. Who you are, what you’ve achieved and what you do will never matter.”Ibrahim takes over the leadership of the NUS at a difficult time for the union, which has has been forced to undergo a radical overhaul because of a £3m deficit. It has been slashing staff numbers, cutting officer roles and selling off its London headquarters in Gray’s Inn Road in order to avoid financial collapse.The union’s considerably more modest new home is in a corner of Hackney community college. Despite the scaled-down nature of the organisation, Ibrahim is enthusiastic about campaigning for a fully funded education system that is accessible to all.She said: “I want to change the narrative of the way we talk about education and for people to understand education is for the public good. I’ve been in the sector for years and seen the mess that it has got into, and the mess it’s heading towards. Free education is not about me. I’ve got my degree. It’s about future generations that are going to come after me.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae5b976cca00859d0e6288196c77abf99ac0af8e/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1031951369b8d7443ca8cfb45d4467c9","title":"how secondhand clothes can save student budgets and the planet","story":"Fed up of fast fashion? Start a revolution with your wardrobe by swapping, sharing and repairing clothesIt may be cheap and on-trend but fast fashion isn’t the answer for cash-strapped students. For Mia Smith, a fashion communication student at Liverpool John Moores University, it’s not an option. “I am strongly aware of the effects fast fashion has on the environment and I believe they’re too catastrophic to ignore,” she says. “More people need to be aware.”Thanks to our hyper-connected world and ethical fashion movements such as Fashion Revolution, we know more about the industry than ever. We know that garment factories pump toxic chemicals into local rivers, farmers use dangerous pesticides to grow the huge amounts of cotton needed, and thousands of gallons of water are used to make just one T-shirt. “The industry’s dirty secrets are now easily uncovered and once revealed they’re hard to ignore,” says Jessica Donnelly, programme leader of fashion communication and styling at De Montfort University.Instead of shelling out on new clothes, why not get creative and make the most of what you already own?I started selling clothes I didn’t wear, on Depop 18 months ago, and after about half a year it became a business.

Rogen replies: “You can say that, but you can’t watch yourself say that: that’s fucked up. Welcome to Hollywood.”Children acting in movies they’re too young to watch is not exactly new. You think back to Jodie Foster playing a child prostitute in Taxi Driver, aged 14, or Linda Blair in The Exorcist and you wonder whether their portrayal of lost innocence was down to real lives lived too fast or just good acting. But it feels more commonplace these days, in a landscape filled with child-centred horrors (It, Stranger Things), violent action movies (remember Kick-Ass?), serious trauma dramas (such as Room, whose star Jacob Tremblay is one of the trio in Good Boys), and now, junior raunch comedies. In Good Boys, our potty-mouthed sixth-graders naively encounter grownup stuff such as drugs, violence, online porn and sex toys. Are they swearing like troopers for comic effect, or is this just what it is like to be a 12-year-old now?By coincidence, we have another movie out this week with the opposite predicament. Dora and the Lost City of Gold updates the kids’ TV cartoon into a live-action Tomb RaiderSpy Kids-style adventure, with its sunny, curious heroine now high-school age (played by 18-year-old Isabela Moner). Despite being a good five years older than the boys of Good Boys, and therefore old enough to go to see it in a cinema, Dora is unwaveringly wholesome and squeaky clean – incongruously so, for some critics. Variety noted the movie’s “virtually asexual chemistry”. The Hollywood Reporter’s Todd McCarthy went one further and complained the movie was “committed to projecting a pre-sexualized version of youth, while throbbing unacknowledged beneath the surface is something a bit more real”. Some were quick to point out that “pre-sexualized” youth might be a good thing in a PG-rated family movie, and by the way, eeeeeuw! “Would he prefer a younger pre-adolescent cast or a hornier version of this movie?” asked geek culture site The Mary Sue.Good Boys and Dora are two facets of the same 21st-century anxiety. We don’t want children to grow up too fast or too slow. We don’t want them to turn out like the Good Boys but suspect they might. We do want them to turn out like Dora but suspect they won’t. We make kids’ movies for kids and we make kids’ movies for adults. Strike the right balance, and you can play to both (I’d hold up Stand By Me, Night of the Hunter, Moonrise Kingdom, even ET). Either way, it is easier to blame the movies than ourselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4429150c108a4fc2739476829585ace8976c7277/0_0_5238_3142/master/5238.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99a4a78ee1a1b4200f87d9e6fe222e80","title":"king of bollywood shah rukh khans plans to bring even more fans to indian film","story":"With his legions of fans as far away as Melbourne, if anyone has the power to transform Indian film it’s superstar SRKOn a freezing cold night outside the Palais Theatre in St Kilda, a feverish crowd braves the spitting rain and bitter winds, restless, eager. The red carpet has been rolled out for the 10th annual Indian Film Festival in Melbourne and the Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan is this year’s guest of honour – and he’s running two hours late.Khan, known simply as SRK, has starred in more than 80 feature films to date. His legions of fans include bespectacled aunties in sensible trainers, girls with glossy Parachute Coconut oiled hairdos, fidgety teens who pretend their parents haven’t accompanied them. “Where is he?” wails a young woman, rattling the barricade opposite Luna Park. Meanwhile, a soft, teasing chant of “Shah Rukh, Shah Rukh, Shah Rukh”starts up, as tabla players begin to circle.When Khan finally arrives, joyful hysteria breaks out. People unselfconsciously climb over the metal barriers to surround him. Traffic grinds to a halt. Grown men trip over each other to get closer. Hands and legs fly in the air. Khan graciously waves and blows kisses, snapping selfies with the crowd. People dripping in bling and designer-wear scramble like schoolchildren to follow him into the theatre.Khan is not simply the “king of Bollywood”, but one of the world’s biggest movie stars. Since arriving in Australia to open the Indian Film Festival he has also received an honorary doctorate at La Trobe University for his film work and his work supporting women’s empowerment, at another event attended by legions of fans. Khan may be living the life of someone with an estimated net worth of over US$6m now, but he tells  Australia that his earliest memories of cinema are much simpler.“My mum was a big movie lover, so I would sit down and press her feet, like most Indian kids do for their parents,” he says. He describes the early “anti-establishment” films of Amitabh Bachchan as inspirational because they proved that someone didn’t need to be highly educated to be successful. As a young aspiring actor, that offered Khan a breakthrough: he was able to adopt a spirit of “OK I want to take things into my hand and make it big.”Khan describes Bollywood in the early 1990s as a “liberal, happy time”. “Yes, you have to work hard yes, you have to come first yes, you have to get a job but love was important, too,” he says.“When I became popular, the kind of cinema I did was maybe not so thought-provoking … It was more entertainment-provoking.” He namechecks some of his early hits: My Name is Khan, Chak De! India, Swades. “What happens is a star does get defined clearly for entertainment. So you can’t veer too much away from that. It can be disappointing for your audience. But as an actor, I need to find more interesting things to do within the gravitas of stardom.”People certainly find him entertaining, even in Australia, though perhaps that shouldn’t be surprising. Australia’s Indian population at the last census was 455,399, the largest number of which were in Victoria. Meanwhile, the presence and accessibility of Hindi language films here has only grown: at least 15 Bollywood films have been shot in Australia since the 90s, including 2005’s Salaam Namaste and 2001’s Dil Chahta Hai. Major national cinema chains like Event and Hoyts also curate a rotating selection of the latest Indian movie releases every season. The catalogue of Hindi language films available on major streaming platforms is also growing, dubbing and subtitling breaking down language and cultural barriers for what was once known as foreign cinema.Many early Bollywood films follow a trusted formula: boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl, and conflict bubbles as they struggle for family approval. However, a new generation of filmmakers are challenging whose stories deserve to be told and how, such as the director and screenwriter Zoya Akhtar, also a guest at this year’s festival, whose latest feature film, Gully Boy, fictionalises the lives of young Mumbai street rappers who chase dreams of fame while writing and performing music with autobiographical lyrics. It’s been called Bollywood’s first hip-hop film, and would have been unheard of in the industry 20 years ago.“The understanding of India is that India is not one thing,” Akhtar says, when asked how international audiences have grown to interpret the subcontinent. “It’s not a monolith. It’s massive. It’s varied in terms of culture, language, food habits … So it’s not simple. You can’t just express it in one word.”“Historically, our cinema is a unique format: two and a half hours, an interval, not just one single storyline,” Khan says. He believes that will soon change: that with younger Indian filmmakers watching more international cinema, Hindi films will go beyond standard song-and-dance structures. “I think all of that should get made into an international storytelling style. There’s so many more stories for the world to take up. … We have a great culture of stories in our country. We just need to express them in newer ways so that we get more of an international audience attaching themselves to it.”Mitu Bhowmick Lange, the director of the Indian Film Festival of Melbourne, says that mythology, Bharatanatyam dance techniques, and the tradition of travelling musical theatre is at the root of India’s ancient folklore and cultural identity – traditions that are far older than the Indian film industry, which dates from the early 1900s. “That style of storytelling is very ingrained in our culture and in our history. I don’t think that can be removed that quickly or that easily, if at all.”Bhowmick Lange says that it’s those elements of escapism and romance that set Bollywood apart from other kinds of cinema, especially in appealing to its primary audience: everyday Indian citizens. “At the end of the day, these films are also catering to somebody who is working around 18 hours and earning the equivalent of $2 a day. So that person, too, needs … three hours away from all their worries,” she says.For Khan though, the dream project is to go right back to the earliest forms of Indian mythology. He says he has long wanted to adapt the Mahabharata, one of the two epic Sanskrit poems based on a sacred Hindu text, for the screen. “Literature in Hindi, in Sanskrit, I think is amazing. All we need to do is to put it in a uniform which is more internationally accepted. I think it’d be fantastic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33cccaddf4169e5391223d8179b5b937731081e0/0_122_2876_1725/master/2876.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8846d59d742e84945398d3186af8e312","title":"solskjaer new signings manchester united chelsea maguire james","story":"Ole Gunnar Solskjær praised Manchester United’s “risk and reward” play as Chelsea were torn apart at Old Trafford on Sunday.An 18th-minute penalty from Marcus Rashford before a second from the forward after the break, along with strikes from Anthony Martial and Daniel James on 65 and 81 minutes, respectively, secured a confidence-boosting victory in what is expected to be a season of transition for United.This left Solskjær delighted. “As we said to the boys before the game, we have found the way we want to play and a way we believe in,” he said. “You’ve just got to go out and do the same. We took risks but that’s the way here. You have got to go for it. It’s risk and reward and today we were rewarded.”Solskjær was pleased with his new signings Harry Maguire, Aaron Wan-Bissaka and James after the opening win. The trio were bought for a combined £145m in the summer and each enjoyed a memorable debut. While Maguire and Wan-Bissaka started, James was a late replacement.“Dan has made a great impact and it is the best feeling ever scoring a goal in front of the Stretford End. You can’t beat that.”While Wan-Bissaka was involved in Rashford’s 67th-minute strike, Solskjær was pleased with United’s display following the interval. “The second half was outstanding, we defended well in shape and counterattacked well,” he said.In the close season Solskjær placed emphasis on improving the conditioning of players. “The fitter you are, the more you can do. It’s as simple as that,” the 46-year-old said. “The boys have been working hard but this is still the start, we can still get some hard work in.”While Martial started in the No 9 position he occupied in pre-season, Rashford was asked to play wider. “Marcus Rashford played that left-handstriker role to perfection today,” said Solskjær.Rashford said: “It was a good start, in the first half we could have been a bit sharper but it is to be expected in the first game. In the second half we looked sharper and the fitness work we have been doing over the summer pulled us through.”Frank Lampard’s team were bright in passages but Chelsea’s manager was left bemoaning a lack of focus.“We made four mistakes and they put them away. It is a reality check for us all,” he said. “We are Chelsea. We don’t want to come here and lose 4-0. It wasn’t a 4-0 game for long periods but we need to accept it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/115dccd7438a6f197d5df30290d190ae14ccdb0a/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80661cc25feeef382d23a3ab34e30c4f","title":"premier league football 10 talking points weekend action","story":"Eddie Howe has a quality problem when it comes to goalkeepers. In the end it was the 21-year-old Aaron Ramsdale, who has been capped at youth level by England and shone in League One with AFC Wimbledon during the second half of last season, who got the nod ahead of Artur Boruc, Mark Travers and Asmir Begovic to make his Bournemouth debut against his former club, having left Sheffield United for around £800,000 on deadline day in January 2017. At the time Chris Wilder was six months into his dream job – and about to tie the knot with wife-to-be Francesca. “I sold him an hour before I got married in London,” Wilder said. “He tried to balls that up. Myself and the chief executive sold him and then that got done and within the hour I was married.” Ben Fisher“I got reminded by my old man that it had been 400-and-something days since I played a league game,” said Nick Pope. To be precise, it was 454 days but the goalkeeper who had made a swift journey from obscurity to eminence appeared to have bought a return ticket during last season as he was first injured and then an understudy. But Burnley nevertheless gave him a four-year deal in May – “the manager and the club proved what they were telling me was true, they really wanted to keep me,” – and with Tom Heaton sold to Aston Villa, Sean Dyche faced the same decision that confronted Gareth Southgate before the 2018 World Cup: Joe Hart or Pope? They arrowed in on the same answer and Pope justified his manager’s faith with a flying save from Nathan Redmond at 0-0. “I think I do have to prove myself all over again,” Pope said. This was an excellent start. Richard JollyThe reception afforded to wantaway Wilfried Zaha when he came off the bench against Everton at Selhurst Park on Saturday not only went down well with the Ivory Coast forward, who expressed his thanks after the match on Twitter with the message: “appreciate the support today 201920”. Having submitted a transfer request and been sent home from training after Palace blocked a potential transfer to Goodison Park, Roy Hodgson had feared the worst for the 26‑year‑old when he was introduced. “It was very nice that they are that forgiving,” he said. “I’m pretty sure he must have been thinking, ‘I wonder how they are going to react to me?’ He knows they love him but of course when you do make public statements like ‘I want to leave the club’ then you do run the risk of the fans not being happy. But luckily that wasn’t the case. Hopefully now we can draw a line under it,” said Hodgson. Ed AaronsIt is easy to criticise Norwich’s tactics at Anfield: against the European champions, the newcomers pursued an attacking approach that left them open, and were duly clouted. However, most weeks they will be playing sides far less good than Liverpool – for whom they still caused problems with their pacy and purposeful play. Teemu Pukki showed enough, both in front of goal and in general play, to suggest that he belongs in the top ision, while Emi Buendía looks to have the touch and agility necessary to supply him. Promoted sides often pick up points at the start of the season, still grooved and confident from the previous one, and – with Newcastle, Chelsea and West Ham the next three games for Daniel Farke’s side before the first international break, Norwich now have a chance to announce themselves properly. Daniel HarrisThe sight of Chelsea youth products Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount playing together for their parent club in an actual Premier League match felt novel. Transfer bans need not be too punitive when a club is one of Europe’s prime talent factories. Where predecessors fearing the Roman Abramovich axe felt unable to risk youngsters, necessity presents Frank Lampard with free rein to do so. Of the two Chelsea’s new manager trusted at Old Trafford, Abraham has the greater experience but looked far more raw, even though he rattled a post early on. Mount buzzed around impressively and outperformed Ross Barkley for one. Other, more experienced teammates were far guiltier of errors in a higher level of schooling than being loaned to Vitesse Arnhem or the Championship. John BrewinAround 300 Newcastle fans marched through the rain from the Sports Direct store in Northumberland Street and congregated by the burger van at the bottom of Strawberry Place. They made their presence felt and registered their protest against Mike Ashley’s continued ownership of the club. But still the club were able to announce an attendance of 47,635, just under 5,000 off capacity. That includes season-ticket holders who may not have turned up but, still, despite the filthy weather there did not appear to be more than 6,000‑7,000 empty seats at St James’. This is a major problem for those who wish to organise protests: it will take far more than that not to turn up before any boycott begins to have an impact and, at the moment, there seems very little appetite for that – or, at least, there are enough casual fans willing to pick up tickets to counter the recusant hardcore. Jonathan WilsonWhen Watford lost seven of their final 11 league games last season it seemed reasonable enough to cite their FA Cup run, and insulation from the relegation zone, as the major factors behind their slump. None of that applies to their confused, sluggish performance against Brighton though and Javi Gracia was right to offer no excuses afterwards. “We need to improve,” he said. His centre‑back, Craig Cathcart, dismissed suggestions of a hangover from last season but the biggest concern might be that their dip actually began around March. Gracia has done a fine job, and opening days have a habit of throwing up strange results, but when these sides met a year ago Watford won with ease and they will be wary of discovering that, in the Premier League, the price of sliding backwards is usually exorbitant. Saturday’s meeting with Everton, the kind of club they were more than comfortable measuring themselves against last season, could be telling. Nick AmesRiyad Mahrez had an odd first season at Manchester City. There were times when the £60m winger looked slightly out of sync with his teammates, which can happen to players adapting to Pep Guardiola’s football, but he could not be written off as a flop. Mahrez scored some crucial goals for the eventual champions and winning the Africa Cup of Nations with Algeria last month appears to have boosted his confidence. With Guardiola not risking Bernardo Silva because of minor fitness concerns, Mahrez excelled during the 5-0 win over West Ham, laying on a lovely scooped assist for the second of Raheem Sterling’s three goals and winning a penalty for Sergio Agüero. It was the kind of performance that made the Algerian a hero at Leicester and it came as a welcome boost for City after losing Leroy Sané to a serious knee injury.

A new Premier League campaign is under way, but unlike at the outset of more recent August dawns, the dreary hegemony of the Big Six elite looks heartwarmingly under threat. Last season, the current top-flight grandees finished as expected: the thoroughbreds of Manchester City galloping first past the post, winning on the nod from Liverpool. Meanwhile, back at the furlong pole, Chelsea, Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United duked it out for the minor placings – so no major shocks there.Chief among the also-rans, ahead of vastly more experienced rivals, came Wolves. New to the Premier League, they were not so prone to a tug of the forelock that they did not biff and bloody a few aristocratic noses. To much surprise, they took an impressive 16 points from those teams who finished above them, gaining many new admirers in the process. Between the league and FA Cup, they registered victories over all apart from Manchester City, before smiting the champions in the recent Asia Cup. A meaningless pre-season friendly it may have been, but for the purposes of this column its importance simply cannot be exaggerated. Wolves are a team who mean business.Having seen them achieve success beyond their wildest dreams last season, their fans can now be forgiven for hoping for even greater things to come. Chelsea go into the season under a transfer embargo, with an inexperienced manager whose credentials are open to question. After a good start at Manchester United, Ole Gunnar Solskjær increasingly had about him the haggard look of a man who has been asked to mind mice at a crossroads, although yesterday’s victory over Frank Lampard’s men will have put a spring back in his step. Wolves, meanwhile, with their astute, well-heeled owners, talented young squad and charming, streetwise manager look well-placed to take advantage of any high-profile stumbles.Last season, weirdly, they harvested one more point from their matches against teams in the top half of the table than those in the bottom, pulling off the remarkable feat of losing at home and away against Huddersfield Town. While the Premier League’s better sides may now have figured how best to cope with Nuno Espiríto Santo’s counterattacking style, he and his players will almost certainly be better equipped to overcome the kind of inferior teams who robbed them of so many points last time. Their squad has been bolstered and their prospects look bright, but there is one significant snag.Back in Europe, they have one foot in a play-off for the Europa League group stages. These are exciting times at Molineux, but while Nuno insists his team’s first foray into European competition in 29 years will have no impact on their top-flight form, recent history suggests he is wide of the mark. Two seasons ago, Sean Dyche led Burnley to a quite remarkable seventh place finish in the Premier League, earning a European berth in the process. Despite failing to advance beyond the qualifiers, they finished the subsequent league campaign with 14 fewer points than they had amassed in the one before. It could legitimately be argued they had hugely overachieved the previous season and were simply returning to Burnley “mean”, but they are not the only side whose league form has noseed while trying to cope with the distraction of Europe.A year before, Everton played 10 Europa League matches, before ending the league season with 12 points fewer than they had won during the campaign in which they booked their passage to Europe. Prior to that, West Ham and Southampton buckled under the strain of playing at home and abroad. After qualifying for Europe in 2015-16, both clubs finished the subsequent Premier League campaign with 17 points fewer than their previous tallies. West Ham played one qualifying round but failed to make the group stages. Southampton failed to get out of a group including Sparta Prague, Hapoel Be’er Sheva and Internazionale. It is the disruption of European qualification rather than the number of games teams are forced to play that seems to cause problems.The previous season, Southampton had proved a rare recent exception to the detrimental effect qualification for the Europa League has on teams from outside the traditional Premier League elite. In 2013-14, they finished seventh with 60 points and subsequently went out to the Danish side Midtjylland in their attempt to make the group stages. They ended the subsequent league campaign in the same position but with three points more. It can be done, but it is clearly more difficult for clubs with squads lower on quality and numbers than those of the traditionally Big Clubs.Wolves have proved their class and on the face of it appear well-resourced enough to cope with the additional demands of European football without letting it affect their assault on the top six or – whisper it – four. However, it is no secret Nuno prefers working with a compact squad and a settled team. Last season, it did not go unnoticed that he played the same starting 11 in the Premier League in his opening nine games. Should they make the Europa League group stages, one suspects a more flexible selection policy will be required. Last week, his team undertook a 6,370-mile round-trip to Armenia, where they swatted aside FC Pyunik in the first leg of their third-round qualifier, but showed no adverse effects on the subsequent 126-mile equivalent from Molineux to Leicester’s King Power Stadium in a state of affairs that suggests the early omens are good.There is an old episode of Friends in which Ross is torn between two ladies who love him and an unsympathetic Chandler jokes about the dilemma in which his pal finds himself. “Oh, no!” he sneers sarcastically. “Two women love me. They’re both gorgeous and sexy, my wallet’s too small for my fifties and my diamond shoes are too tight!” Wolves now find themselves on the horns of a similar dilemma. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this difficult time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4aa7306e3f7a419908e48cfef18a468a03d9e775/73_31_3793_2276/master/3793.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=401348670e078c2a72b30db74384806a","title":"met apologises over cressida dicks stop and search group claim","story":"London police commissioner told MPs she had ‘regularly’ met with StopwatchThe politan police have apologised for giving “a contrary impression” when its commissioner Cressida Dick told MPs the force met “really regularly” with StopWatch, which campaigns for the fair and effective use of stop and search, after the charity disputed the claim.Use of stop and search powers has been increasing sharply in a number of police areas including London, where it rose fivefold last year, and the government expanded police stop and search powers on Sunday to allow an additional 8,000 officers to conduct searches without reasonable suspicion across the country if it is thought serious violence may occur.Dick made the comments last month in the home affairs committee after Tory MP Rehman Chishti cited a report by StopWatch which said young people from ethnic minorities were being “subjected to relentless searching without a demonstrable, legitimate purpose and sometimes several times a day.”In response she said: “I am very pleased to live and work in a city where there are groups who see it as their job to hold the police to account, keep an eye and campaign on certain issues, and that is what is StopWatch does.“We meet with them really regularly. We know each other very well, but I can’t possibly answer that question because I don’t know who they are talking about, when or where.”StopWatch’s Dr Michael Shiner said her remarks had given a false impression that the Met was consulting with his organisation. “This came as a surprise to us because StopWatch has never met with Cressida and has not had a meeting with any other senior officers from the Met for at least three years.”He criticised how both the Met and the Home Office have become less committed to improving accountability in recent years. “We’ve heard of cases in London where police are not even giving people a receipt let alone a record of the stop and search,” Shiner said.A Met spokeswoman said: “The commissioner was referring to a number of groups who hold police to account on stop and search, many of whom we regularly meet and engage with across London and at various levels.“We do not meet regularly with StopWatch and are sorry if a contrary impression was given.“Stop and search remains an important power in tackling crime and protecting people. We use it in response to intelligence and where we believe there to be a threat from violence. We fully recognise that stop-and-search powers must be used lawfully, courteously and be subject to proper assessment.”Up until December 2017, there were discussions in private working groups around how to reform the best use of stop and search (BUSS) scheme, which aimed to reduce ‘no suspicion’ searches. However, StopWatch and Release, the UK’s centre on drug laws, said that the Home Office dropped proposals to improve the scheme and suddenly withdrew from the consultations.Officials allegedly said they would propose to ministers the introduction of better data collection measures to record particulars around drug possession, such as whether there was an intent to supply any specific drug.The charities also expected a commitment for inidual police forces to produce annual reports explaining disproportionality, as well as measures to move oversight of scrutiny panels to police and crime commissioners to make them independent.Now, the home secretary Priti Patel has appeared to scrap the scheme altogether after it was announced on Sunday she will “lift all conditions in the voluntary best use of stop and search scheme over the use of Section 60” in an attempt to crack down on violent crime.“This is to do with political ambition, party politics and self interest rather than effective crime control,” Shiner, also an associate professor at the London School of Economics, said. “The mood music has changed, its regressive.”Niamh Eastwood, the director of Release, said this was a “shocking development” and warned racial disparities in use of the powers could widen, with black people 40 times more likely to be stopped and searched.“The evidence for the effectiveness of Section 60 is incredibly weak,” she said. “The find rate is the lowest for all the stop and search grounds. It disproportionately targets black men at very high rates.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “Intelligence-led stop and search is an important tool. As we have made clear this week, the government fully supports the police in its fair and targeted use. The Home Office will continue to engage with partners on important issues relating to stop and search.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e321d2702f2a582bf631935c740829e05fb59d5/0_233_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a2ff06f21c0cf8efa09192519ff3958","title":"five ways to look after your joints","story":"It’s not all about stretching.

Registered dietitian Sue Baic, a spokesperson for the British Dietetic Association, breaks it down: “For every 0.5kg (1lb) lost, we reduce the weight going through the knee joint at each step by 2kg (4.5lb).” Excess body fat, especially around the abdomen, is also inflammatory, making any osteoarthritis symptoms worse.“A common misconception is that people think exercise will aggravate joint pain,” says Giles Stafford, a consultant orthopaedic hip surgeon at the Wellington Hospital, part of HCA Healthcare UK. But strengthening the muscles around joints is important, says Stafford, especially if you have any issues with them, as it will minimise the pressure on them. Hip problems, for example, can be improved or even prevented by maintaining a good functional range of motion and muscle strength. Stafford recommends body weight exercises such as squats and lunges, and light dumbbell exercises such as bicep curls.When it comes to exercise, variety is key. Jamieson recommends a mixture of impact and non-impact cardio for good bone density and strength training (ensuring guidance is sought for correct technique). Yoga can help maintain good mobility but Jamieson says to combine it with other forms of exercise.Stafford warns against over-stretching: “It can take the joint past its natural physiological range, which can cause damage to the joint and surrounding structures.”“Some recent research has suggested that diets high in saturated fat – found in fatty meats and meat products, full-fat dairy, cakes, biscuits, butter and coconut oil – can weaken the cartilage in the knee and hip so that it is more prone to damage and loss of cushioning,” says Baic. She recommends a Mediterranean-style diet, higher in monounsaturated fats such as olive or rapeseed oil, with plenty of fruit, vegetables, wholegrains, nuts and seeds. As omega-3 fat is anti-inflammatory, Baic suggests one to two servings of oily fish each week (or in the recommended dose if taken in oil form). Also pay attention to your vitamin D levels, which are crucial for bone development: it is believed one in five people in the UK have low levels.Maintaining good posture is key to preventing joint issues, says Jamieson. “You want to be very careful of your back particularly: there is no surgery that will replace your discs or spine yet.” The NHS publishes an online guide tackling common posture mistakes. It is also important to wear the correct, supportive footwear for exercises and activity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18bf77cbb66c344b63f76d6f7ba49c4599abf8aa/0_120_8660_5196/master/8660.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4694aa519e0b2156a26c3be56c7e7de3","title":"way to go how to save for the big moments in life","story":"Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good planning for your financial freedomMany of life’s most important milestones – buying your first home, getting married, starting a family and preparing for retirement – have one thing in common: the need for money. The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen. Try to take a long-term view, and check how your strategy is working for the long term, rather than from month to month. Remember: investments should be viewed as a five-year commitment, so make sure you think of these as a long-term strategy.Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Remember, the value of any tax benefits described depends on your inidual circumstances, and tax rules may change in the future.Whatever your situation, and no matter your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

I don’t want to get into an argument, but the complaint is spoiling my enjoyment of itQ I have recently had installed a small 2.4m x 2.1m summerhouse at the bottom of our terraced garden. The height is less than 2.5m. I wanted to use the building to enjoy our garden and as a painting studio.Unfortunately my neighbour is unhappy about it. She says the windows face her kitchen and bedroom. I can’t actually see into her kitchen as we have a high fence and the garden slopes down. I can only see her bedroom window if I look up.I’m pretty sure my building doesn’t go against planning regulations. My neighbour’s complaint has somewhat spoilt my enjoyment of my little studio, and I’m wondering how to respond. I do intend to buy some net curtains and pin these up when I’m painting. I don’t want to get into an argument with my neighbour. We don’t speak as they are not friendly, and in the past they have always complained whenever we do anything to the house or garden.I wonder if you have any helpful advice?A Don’t let your neighbours’ complaints get to you, and certainly don’t get into a discussion. In my experience, if someone is convinced that something is the case – for instance that you can see into their kitchen andor bedroom – no amount of fact or logic is going to get them to back down. Some neighbours of a friend of mine are convinced that she can see into their kitchen through their back door. She can’t – and I’ve seen it firsthand – but that hasn’t stopped the neighbours being thoroughly unpleasant about it. I’m also pretty sure that your summer house doesn’t go against planning regulations. That’s because most garden buildings – whether a shed, greenhouse or summerhouse – do not require planning permission because they come under the heading of what’s called “permitted development”. However, to be sure that planning permission is not required, there are certain provisos that have to be met. If, for instance, a garden building is to be erected within 2m of the property boundary, the height of the building’s eaves must be no more than 2.5m. Wherever it is put, it must be single storey, with no veranda or balcony, and the floor area must not exceed 15 square metres. It must also be used for domestic purposes only. Companies who sell garden buildings are usually fully conversant with what makes a building permitted development because its in their interests to know the rules. The rules are less straightforward if you live in a listed building or in another type of protected area, such as an area of outstanding natural beauty, national park or conservation area. So anyone living in such a protected area who wants to put up a garden building would be wise to talk to the local planning office before going ahead. In the case of your summerhouse, although you don’t have to, you might want to talk to your planning office so that you can put your mind at rest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/241095b263d90aed087b49c3c11652b44b912205/0_0_1675_1005/master/1675.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0895d1247a7753cd2f82c4cb76c3c45a","title":"britons have spent 4bn stockpiling goods in case of no deal brexit","story":"Research suggests one in five people have a food, drinks and medicine hoard worth £380Britons have spent £4bn stockpiling goods in preparation for a possible no-deal Brexit, new research suggests.One in five people are already hoarding food, drinks and medicine, spending an extra £380 each, according to a survey by the finance provider Premium Credit. The survey found that about 800,000 people have spent more than £1,000 building up stockpiles before the 31 October Brexit deadline.If the UK leaves with no deal, businesses predict there will be short-term supply problems, which the government says it is mitigating.Brexit-related stockpiling is also hitting cashflow, according to the report, with companies taking out credit to cover the cost of insurance and other fixed costs.Adam Morghem of Premium Credit said: “The level of stockpiling by British businesses and households is well documented, but there has been little focus on the impact this has had on cashflow, which has been quite negative.“Interestingly, over the past three months we have seen an increase in clients looking to use premium finance to pay for their insurance, and we believe a key factor behind this is the impact of stockpiling on cashflows, forcing more businesses and households to spread the cost of their insurance.“Businesses should also check with their brokers to make sure their stockpiled goods are properly insured.”Last week, the boss of Pets at Home revealed the business was hoarding pet food, and Domino’s Pizza said it has started stockpiling toppings."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/abb69a9e29201f00c403e0eaf4483e3a51240f1b/34_0_680_408/master/680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b546ecbf9bf91a31c364c72f9e1bf39d","title":"can you solve it get the gossip with bobby seagull","story":"How to spread the wordToday’s puzzle was suggested to me by Bobby Seagull, who was told it by his brother, who was told it by a Cambridge don.Four friends each have a different piece of gossip.

The 21-year-old ultimately showed a class and a maturity beyond her years, enough indeed to head home with the $500,000 (£415,000) winner’s prize.However, it was only after the British driver’s usual calm control had seemed to almost evaporate after 30 minutes of racing during which her championship might have slipped away. “I have been under this sort of pressure before,” she said. “But it’s a lot different when there is half a million at stake.”Coming out of the heart of this maelstrom on top demonstrated Chadwick’s strength of character. Her title brought the W Series to a close after what can be considered a very successful first year for the championship created to promote women in motor racing.Yet what was expected to be a relatively straightforward coronation turned into a nail-baiting climax. Chadwick needed a podium finish to be assured of the title but managed only fourth. Britain’s Alice Powell won the race, from the Finn Emma Kimiläinen. Beitske Visser of the Netherlands, the only driver who could challenge Chadwick, was third and with a 13-point deficit, that was not good enough.However, when Visser passed Chadwick during the race, the title seemed momentarily to hang in the balance before the British driver closed it out. Knowing she had done enough with fourth, Chadwick’s relief after she climbed from the car was palpable. She has won twice and finished on the podium three times in five races this season but admitted the task of claiming the title had proved hard to bear.“I have mixed emotions, I can’t take it all in, that was the worst 30 minutes of my life, followed by the best 30 minutes,” she said. “I don’t know what I was doing, the pressure just got to me. I knew I had the championship to fight for and I made mistakes.”For a driver who is already a multiple championship winner, this one meant the most, because it had been the hardest fought.“This has been by far the best of my wins,” she said. “This year has been one of the toughest I have had, everything around it has been far, far greater. Normally you can go under the radar in junior motor sport, you have not had this exposure. This is the first year I have been exposed to that, you can’t make mistakes, you are in an intense environment.”She had opened the day well, taking pole position by pipping Powell, to the top spot, while Visser managed only fifth. It appeared the scene was set for another dominant run for Chadwick and, while Visser moved up to fourth on the second lap, out front Chadwick was holding her own with Powell and Kimiläinen tucked up under her rear wing.At the mid point, however, under pressure for the lead and unwilling to risk a clash, Chadwick gave Powell and Kimiläinen space to squeeze up the inside, late-braking through Paddock. It was close, Powell and Chadwick touched but ultimately the latter played the percentages like a seasoned pro and focused on the big picture.She was consequently exposed to Visser but the British driver held third until a late safety car bunched up the field and when racing restarted Chadwick put her wheels wide on the grass at the entry to turn six, letting Visser through. With just over three laps to go Visser still needed to win but was a full four seconds off Powell. It was too far and Chadwick held her nerve and fourth, enough for the title.She had the title and the championship, which boasted five different winners in six races, the conclusion it deserved. Chadwick was taken on earlier this year as development driver for the Williams F1 team and was convinced that the W Series was very much on the right track. “This year has provided a platform that I never thought I would have,” she said. “As the first year in the series goes it is incredible what I have managed to achieve.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28df63f3752627499664a3892bcaadfb04e70828/0_67_3079_1848/master/3079.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c0948d71420ddd78a81a00ba73732e3","title":"tennis andy murray cincinnati china open zhuhai","story":"Andy Murray, on the eve of his return to singles competition for the first time since his hip resurfacing surgery six months ago, was relaxed as he discussed his comeback in the Cincinnati Masters 1000 with an encouraging mixture of hope and perspective.“I have zero pain,” he said before his first-round match against Richard Gasquet. “I’m not expecting to be moving as well as I used to but I still think I can probably move better than I am just now. But that will take time. I started playing singles again only a couple of weeks ago.“Obviously, when you’re playing at the highest level against the best players, they hit the ball big and it takes time to get used to that again. And there’s still some improvement to come from my hip operation.”After so many injuries and a clear uncertainty about the hip procedure, Murray’s return since his operation has been surprisingly swift. Last August in Washington the pain in his hip led him to weep audibly in his chair after a long, three-set victory against Marius Copil.At the Australian Open in January Murray announced the hip had forced him to search for an exit route. After what seemed like one final breathless fight in a five-set first-round defeat by Roberto Bautista Agut, he was awkwardly ushered off the court to videos of his peers celebrating his career, as if he had already retired.Since the 28 January operation, however, Murray has been consistently ahead of schedule. In June he marked his surprise doubles comeback at the Queen’s Club with a title alongside Feliciano López. At Wimbledon Murray was not even certain he would compete in the US swing in any capacity, yet he decided to return to doubles action immediately in Washington. During his appearances in Washington and Montreal he trained for singles throughout before accepting a singles wildcard into Cincinnati. He attributes the swift recovery to his hip’s response to his workload.“Pain-wise, obviously, I don’t have pain in my hip, so that was one,” Murray said. “Recovering from practices that I had? Fine, there were no issues later in the day with my hip. And then performances in practices with top singles players. At some stage you have to take the step to try to play. My team felt like this was the right time to do that. That’s why I’m giving it a go.”Far from an isolated test event, Murray’s comeback is already picking up steam. Though his participation in best-of-five-sets matches at the US Open remains in the balance, he announced on Sunday that he will compete at the Zhuhai Open and then the China Open in Beijing after the US Open, starting on 23 September. Still, Murray soberly acknowledges that his progress may not continue to soar. If his level is not competitive with the top players and the bad draws that inevitably lie ahead, the Scot admitted he would consider dropping down to ATP Challenger events.“If things don’t go well and I feel like it might take me a little longer to get up to this level, then that’s definitely an option. That’s something I’d be fine with doing. Ultimately I’d like to be competing at this level. The quickest way to get up to speed is by being on the practice and match court with top players in my opinion.”As Murray completed his first singles press conference in more than six months he shrugged before departing with perspective. “It’s gonna be difficult but, yeah, that’s just what you have to deal with. That’s the situation I’m in and I would have signed up for being in this position that I’m in right now six months ago. Absolutely.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9d9b9c360620ec1f327285de80bfe9b3502cf9c/0_186_2467_1480/master/2467.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30af5344688f3b11b86d9e0236e0c22f","title":"steve smith australia comeback cherished","story":"Steve Smith is ruining Test cricket. Like a maverick cop forced off active duty, he has been back only five minutes but is already laying the town to waste. Or at least this is the perception in some parts of the British Isles.Some objections come from the internet eggs that spawn around comment threads, decrying him as a cheat who should never be allowed near a cricket field again – you know, like all the other ball-tamperers who were banned for life rather than being feted as greats of the game with commentary contracts and hall of fame places.Another interpretation is that cricket is now futile because Smith is too good. He was out of the game a year and a half, confined to desk duties by some chief who did not appreciate his way of getting results. But the instant he got back on those mean streets, he started cleaning them up again. Two centuries from two attempts, and the Ashes may as well be surrendered now.It is true that Smith can become impossible to bowl to and never more so than against England: five centuries in his past six Ashes Tests, averaging 139. That is a whole lot of stepping across the stumps to knock a single to midwicket. At times Smith seems to form a wall: a bat that always middles the ball, two pads lined up behind it that are never struck. In a game that hinges on getting players out, what happens when you cannot get one out?Of course none of this is actually accurate. Anyone can and does and will get out. Every batsman fails more often than not. Smith might get a pair this week at Lord’s. What he has done is worked out a system against an even-paced right-arm seam attack while neutering England’s principal off-spinner.As Smith explained in 2017, he used to take guard on middle stump and not have a preliminary movement. This meant he could be drawn into edges outside off stump. One could see it at Trent Bridge 2013: stock-still as the ball was delivered, bat high in the backlift, he drove hard for an important 50 before Jimmy Anderson found some outswing and a nick.To combat this, Smith eventually took guard on leg stump and stepped all the way across to off. That can make players vulnerable to lbw but Smith is so strong off his legs that it opens up that scoring area while shrinking the channel. “It’s a big movement,” he explained, “but for me it’s about trying to minimise the ways that you get out. If guys get me out lbw, I say well played, congratulations but, if I nick one off, that’s when I get upset at myself.”The best way to get Smith is still the outside edge. That is where any player is vulnerable. The bowlers who keep feeding the line on his pads are the ones he keeps gorging on. Anderson equally tried to keep this perspective on the BBC’s Tailenders podcast. “He’s a great player but he is a human being. There are ways of getting him out, whether it’s not trying all these fancy plans – just sticking to your basics a bit longer.”Anderson has bowled to the greats of his era and has got them all out at one time or another. Perhaps it is more possible for him to avoid playing the reputation rather than the player. One example is the sudden feverish interest in left-arm spin, with Smith averaging 37 against it as opposed to 51 or better against right-arm spin or pace with either arm. But the case has definitely been overstated.Rangana Herath got Smith five times in Sri Lanka in 2016 but that was Herath at his absolute best, bowling half the team’s overs and taking 27 wickets on spinning tracks. Ravindra Jadeja had him four times but likewise bowled half the overs when Australia visited in 2017. Keshav Maharaj and Dean Elgar got him four times between them in 2018 but South Africa had no right-arm spinner. If one mostly faces left-arm bowling, there is no significance getting out to it.In terms of right-arm spin, Smith’s stronger record includes any number of part-timers and bowlers such as Moeen Ali, whom he has climbed on top of. Moeen has dismissed Smith three times in 18 innings while giving away a truckload of runs. What Smith has done is never let him settle.England will bring in the left-armer Jack Leach for Moeen at Lord’s, though that is as much to do with Moeen’s lack of form. Three days out Smith was facing local left-armers. “No margin for error with your length and you have to have your pace right up there,” was the observation from one of the net bowlers. Any false shots? A shake of the head. “Just to bowl a dot to Steve Smith is an achievement.”During the spell Smith kept complimenting deliveries on flight or shape. He kept touching each part of his body, as he does in the middle. He stayed until near the end, as did David Warner. This was an optional session. Of course they were there. None of this is coincidental.Steve Smith is not destroying Test cricket. He entertained it, then he bruised it, now he is gracing it again – the best at his best, defying the odds. Ethics and ramifications can be argued for decades. But it will not take that long to appreciate that in these brief years we have been witnessing something very special."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14a59d8326b20fbff80cc7450bfa000f20a85a86/4_0_4906_2945/master/4906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed609463ab0343683cae763cdd2f5ca5","title":"the louth outback races in pictures","story":"A drought-hit village with a population of just 30 on the Darling River in outback New South Wales is flooded with racegoers for its annual race meet.

Billed as the biggest arts festival in the world, the fringe offers thousands of different shows with plenty to cater for almost any taste you might imagine. Almost.For the last two years grassroots organisation Fringe of Colour has been on a mission to highlight and rectify the lack of BAME presence at the festival. Last year Layton Williams, an actor who has appeared on BBC Three in Bad Education and on the West End as Billy Elliot, accused security staff at the Assembly George Square venue of racial profiling after they alleged that he looked like a man who had jumped the fence two weeks before. The venue eventually apologised, but Williams’ experience is not unique.Not every experience is negative, and of course the fringe also offers unimaginable opportunity for directors, producers and performers, with many considering it the highlight of their creative year. Those in charge of the fringe are also making an effort to increase inclusivity, having designated ersity as one of the key strands of this year’s fringe central programme. But is enough being done to welcome people of all backgrounds to the fringe? We asked comedians, performers and  readers about their experiences.I haven’t had any proper negative experiences unless you count the occasional hostile reaction from drunk men when I tell them I’m not Romesh Ranganathan. When I told another BAME friend that I hadn’t experienced much racism in Edinburgh, they said “It’s because you get to be Nish”. I’ve been able to exist outside of the usual micro-aggressions because of the status I have at the fringe.I have heard more stories about racism in Edinburgh from other performers over the last couple years, but I suspect that is a symptom of a wider national problem with people becoming more comfortably racist. There’s also this weird strain of liberal racism where people believe they’re so liberal that they couldn’t possibly be racist – at another festival I had a woman describe me as “a little bit namaste”. Edinburgh changed my life and I owe my career to it so I really want to give more people from backgrounds like mine the sense that this is something they can do too. Nish Kumar, comedianI’ve heard other BAME acts talk about how their friends don’t even come up to Edinburgh because of the associated costs. The fringe is definitely skewed towards wealthier people who might not be from a BAME background, and so you’re fighting an uphill battle if you’re doing something for a more varied audience. Personally I haven’t experienced any racism at the fringe, but I still think what Fringe of Colour is doing is fantastic – if only there was a way they could eliminate the transport and hotel costs since they’re likely the biggest inhibitor stopping young BAME people from going up to the fringe. Arnab ChandaOur poetry collective, 4 BROWN GIRLS WHO WRITE, did a five-day run at the fringe with three sell-out shows. We felt that it was important to create a space for performers of colour. Both our white and non-white audience members felt empowered by the stories and voices on our stage and we even had one white member of the audience tell us that the show had helped her reflect on her privilege. We received a great response from our audiences who said there weren’t any shows like ours. We were there to creatively challenge the audience through our collective vulnerability of what it’s like to be “othered” – and people were welcoming of the space we created. 4 Brown Girls Who Write, performers and poets, LondonI love the fringe and want to keep going every year, but sometimes the subtle ignorance can get tiring. As a hijab-wearing Muslim, people handing out flyers for shows don’t approach me but instead give flyers to my white, non-hijab wearing friends. At comedy shows I’ve gotten used to comedians never trying to begin a conversation with me, no matter how many times I sit in the front row, and at bars I find people staring at me before quickly looking away. These things may be small but they all add up to make it clear that the fringe is not meant for people who look like me. Faaiza, 33, LondonI have a love-hate relationship with the fringe. Having worked on it 14 years out of the past 29, I love that the best emerging acts come to Edinburgh in August and I get the artistic nourishment that isn’t there the rest of the year. However, as an Indian woman and a creative, I hate how invisible BAME work and artists are made, through lack of access to high-profile showcases, press coverage and reviews. It can be a breeze for some BAME people but for most of us it’s not about our art, it’s about physical and mental stamina. To succeed you have to be a fighter. Annie George, performer, EdinburghI’ve been attending the fringe for almost 13 years and have never felt out of place as an ethnic minority. Perhaps more widening access schemes and better space and accommodation would help ease this problem. I think it would be more effective to reduce prices of concession tickets overall and have cheaper tickets for Edinburgh locals. It’s expensive to put on a show and this is off-putting for poorer people generally. Gurjit, EdinburghAs brilliant as the fringe is, I did look around when I was there and think: “why is this not more erse?” And I didn’t have an answer to that. With more ersity you get more interesting stories, which is especially important for art forms like theatre. There’s nothing wrong with admitting that a lack of ersity is a problem for the fringe. I do believe that to fix that there has to be a top-down movement with people who organise it making an effort to be more inclusive.

They get just one day off throughout August – so they have to use it wisely…I love my show and when you have a day off, the next day is a bit lacklustre. But I do need it because I am a queen and I deserve a rest. I’m of the “living your best life” mantra and I don’t just talk it, I walk it. I’ll have a long spa day – massage, mani, pedi, eyebrows – go for the sexiest dinner in this nice hotel on the bridge with all my girls, then get cocktails. I’m single, but I’m like Lady Gaga – she doesn’t sleep with guys when she’s writing her album because men steal her creative energy. But on my day off, I’m allowed.I’m doing an extra gig for Sarah Millican’s podcast, Standard Issue Stands Up, on my day off. I’m excited but it means this is the first year I won’t have a full duvet day, watching programmes with no artistic merit. In Edinburgh, I’ve found what helps my mental health is being able to cook for myself. I love making soup, so I’ll make a big pot. There’s this old recipe my mum used – grating a carrot, opening a tin of tomatoes and a stock cube, using whatever veg is decomposing at the bottom of the fridge, and throwing some salt and pepper on it. My version of mindfulness is watching YouTube and making soup.Previously I’ve taken the night off and gone into the Highlands. I love hill-walking and have committed to bagging all of Scotland’s 282 Monros. I’ve done 105 so far and always try and knock off a few more during the fringe. But my kids are going to be here this year, so I think it would be really bad form if I went: “Well, I’m pissing off to the Highlands!” We’ll be hanging out during the day seeing various kids’ shows, then I’ll be getting a babysitter and me and my wife will go out for a fancy-schmancy dinner.Ed Byrne: If I’m Honest is at the Assembly Rooms until 25 August (not 12)I’m going to enjoy the day off in an organic way. In Edinburgh there are so many people – maybe you bump into them and say: “Let’s have a coffee.” But I don’t know what kind of state I’ll be in, so I’ll listen to my body. I’m doing my show in my second language and,a few years ago my brain was so exhausted that I couldn’t speak in English properly! Two years ago, I did a show around 9:40pm and towards the end I started to hear fireworks. I was curious, so I might go watch the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo.I look at the day off like a carrot dangling in front of me. Some people prefer not to break that momentum, but I need to. I’ll listen to something repetitive and minimalist and look at nice things. In past years I’ve gone round the art galleries. I would love to get out of the city but I might settle for sitting in the park and reading. As long as I can’t see any posters. I’ve always had Tuesday off as opposed to Monday, which most people choose. It means it feels like a separate, solitary experience. I feel justified in putting on some Philip Glass and going for a wander.The main reason for the day off – or what would’ve been my reason – is to have a big night the night before. You can have a hangover and it won’t affect the show. I technically have the last day of the festival off, but I’m using it to go home earlier. A lot of people feel pressure on their day off to see the shows they clash with. You make promises to friends, but it’s horrific because you’re probably choosing between five shows. This year, I’m like: ‘Oh no, unfortunately I’ll never be able to see you!’"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0c1519928b379ee282ee6948a474376fc7c9fc7/0_0_5760_3840/master/5760.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1e4ba70abcfe8b98526781afe3a16858 2020w","title":"peter crouch getting 50000 people on feet cant replicate that","story":"He’s played for seven Premier League clubs and been capped 42 times, but last month he finally hung up his boots. So what’s next for one of Britain’s best-loved footballers?Since failing to break into the first team at Tottenham as a teenager and getting loaned out to Dulwich Hamlet and IFK Hässleholm in the Swediesh third tier, Crouchy has spent two decades proving people wrong. The wrong shape to be a striker, the wrong shape to be any kind of footballer, he scored 108 Premier League goals for the seven Premier League clubs he played for, including ridiculous bicycle kicks – then he really was hanging upside down in the air – and that wonder volley against Manchester City. He scored 42 goals for Liverpool. And, after initially being booed by England supporters, he was capped 42 times for his country, scored 22 times and went to two World Cups. Recently, he has been proving himself in different ways. With his (second) autobiography, his comic tweeting and his excellent That Peter Crouch Podcast on the BBC, he has demonstrated qualities not often associated with or witnessed in his profession: insightfulness, awareness of some of the absurdities of his world, a sense of humour. Crouchy is funny. “Summer for me is about time with the family,” he Tweeted, with a picture of him feeding giraffes. An interview once asked he what he would be if he hadn’t been a footballer. “A virgin,” came the reply.Back of the Net won’t just be a trip back down Lad Way, he promises, a return to Baddiel and Skinner’s Fantasy Football League. “I think maybe that’s been done and football’s moving in a different direction,” he says, citing the rise of the women’s game. Logan will help to ensure that the programme is not just blokey banter. “It’s not just young lads who like football any more,” Crouch says. “It’s a huge range of different people – everyone, really.”Apart from Clancy, that is. She has been known to call her husband at 10 to three on a Saturday to ask what his plans are for the afternoon. He doesn’t mind that she’s not interested – in fact, it’s nice to come home and talk about other things, he says. She wasn’t interested in the Women’s World Cup either. It’s the game, not him. Did he watch it? “Yeah. It was very good the standard was good, the coverage was good, England did great. I would’ve liked to have seen them win it, obviously, but America were the best team in the tournament.”It will help more girls into football, he says, although his daughters – Sophia, 8, and Liberty, 4 – seem to have inherited their mother’s apathy towards the game. The elder takes an interest when it suits her, like when some of the boys at holiday camp asked her if her dad really was Peter Crouch. Suddenly, he says, she wanted him to come and pick her up. “And she came on the field after the last game at Burnley they enjoyed that.”Football may have broadened its appeal and become more inclusive over the course of the 23 years Crouch has played the game, but it has also seen a return to the bad old days. There are more incidents of overt racism in the stands. “Yeah, that’s something we don’t want to see or hear,” he says. And is it not extraordinary that there are still no current Premier League footballers who are gay and out? It’s like a last bastion of homophobia. “There is talk of a gay footballer coming out,” he says. “But I don’t think it would be an issue now it shouldn’t be, in this day and age.” Crouch has had abuse hurled at him from the stands, including – since starting out as a teenager – chants of “freak”. And it did get to him. “Of course, I was a bit conscious of being so skinny and tall. I’m different-looking to the average footballer. So, obviously, when I started getting those chants it was hurtful, and it pushed me to the point where I thought: ‘Do I really want to put myself through this?’ Yes, I had doubts and things like that, but I look back on it now and I’m proud of coming through that.”He’s not just different-looking. Crouch doesn’t behave like your stereotypical Premier League player, either. “I think footballers are perhaps too guarded. Maybe I’ve let people in a bit more, just being a bit more honest.”No, it’s not to do with being more middle-class, he says. (His dad worked in advertising – Crouch did work experience at his agency and loved it. He says he might have gone into something like that – as well as remaining a virgin, obviously – if he hadn’t become a footballer). “I had quite a traditional upbringing, but, you know, I grew up around football and footballers, I was the same I’ve got a lot of my mates from football.”He says the football industry and many players take themselves way too seriously. “If you’re a player at the highest level, and you get told you’re amazing, day in, day out, it may be hard to climb down from there,” he says, raising his hand from the sofa, to indicate the highest level. But Crouch wasn’t always up there (except literally). Perhaps that helped make him who is, I say. He says the loan in Sweden grounded him and made him really work for success.“Then I had to struggle at QPR I went up and down, got to the Premier League, but even at 23 I wasn’t quite ready for the Premier League. I went back down. I wasn’t Michael Owen, I didn’t burst on and score a goal for England at 18. I sometimes think the way I did it …”, he pauses, then laughs. “No, listen, I’d rather have been Michael Owen.” But imagine listening to That Michael Owen Podcast. Exactly now you’re imagining switching it off.When we meet, Crouch hasn’t officially hung up the size 12s, and he jokes about taking over from Gareth Bale at Real Madrid, or Neymar at Paris Saint-Germain. But a couple of days later he announces his retirement, on Twitter. And the love comes gushing in, practically national-treasure levels. There is nothing like quitting to silence the knockers and the doubters. He is obviously thinking a lot about it when we meet. He talks about missing the game. “Scoring a goal in front of 50,000 people, getting everyone on their feet, you can’t replicate that. How else do you get 50,000 people to stand up by something you’ve done?”It’s not easy, retiring in your 30s. He thinks there should be more help for players when they reach the end of their playing days. “You got all this money but if you don’t invest it, it finishes and you’ve got no other skills, no other qualifications in anything else. It can be hard and you can see why players get depressed, they drink, or gamble, or get orced it happens a lot. I think there needs to be some sort of care for players.” Crouch feels fortunate, in that he has options that other retiring players don’t have. He’s got his coaching badges, that’s always an option. Oh, and he’s even got the GNVQ in Leisure and Tourism he did as a teenager at Spurs (Ledley King was in the same class). “I could open a swimming pool or something, be a lifeguard.” But for now the media stuff is going well. He loves doing That Peter Crouch Podcast and people love listening to it. “I literally sit there in a pub, having a beer, chatting to a couple of lads about football. It’s like the best job ever.” And now the Amazon show is starting. Move over Gary Lineker, is that what we are saying? “Ha ha ha, no, I’m not saying that. I think you only get out what you put in and he has obviously put a hell of a lot of work into where he is. Because he’s so good at what he does, you forget how good he was as a player. If I can have half the career he has had, that would be good.”Will he be paid as much as Lineker? “No, I will not. He does very well.” Probably unsurprisingly, he won’t tell me how much he will be paid. Will he be political, as Lineker is? “No. He enjoys it. Obviously, I’ve got my opinions, but they won’t be getting shared.” Red or blue, though – talking not Liverpool football teams, but politics? “Ha, green.” Leave or remain? “Oh, no comment, I’m not getting involved in that it just angers people. I think that’s genuinely why people enjoyed the podcast, because every other podcast I looked at was a Brexit podcast. Everyone is talking about leaving and remaining – it’s like, let’s put that down for a second and have a laugh.”Back of the Net is available on Tuesday evenings on Amazon Prime"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/792aa75cec1e1965ef0e20a5077200511e87ce83/0_366_3357_2013/master/3357.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1c37f4f784aba7007f47ac0457fa9eed","title":"tv tonight horrors and hardships in kate winslets family closet","story":"The Oscar-winner travels to Scandinavia to explore longstanding rumours.

China controls another part in the east.India and Pakistan have gone to war three times over Kashmir, most recently in 1999. Artillery, mortar and small arms fire are still frequently exchanged.After the partition of colonial India in 1947, small, semi-autonomous ‘princely states’ across the subcontinent were being folded into India or Pakistan. The ruler of Kashmir dithered over which to join until tribal fighters entered from Pakistan intent on taking the region for Islamabad.Kashmir asked Delhi for assistance, signing a treaty of accession in exchange for the intervention of Indian troops, who fought the Pakistanis to the modern-day line of control.In 1948, the UN security council called for a referendum in Kashmir to determine which country the region would join or whether it would become an independent state. The referendum has never been held.In its 1950 constitution, India granted Kashmir a large measure of independence. But since then it has eroded some of that autonomy and repeatedly intervened to rig elections and dismiss and jail democratically elected leaders.Kashmir’s special status, given in exchange for joining the Indian union, has been in place since 14 May 1954. Under article 370, the state was given a separate constitution, a flag, and autonomy over all matters except for foreign affairs and defence.\u0026nbspAn additional provision, article 35a, prevented people from outside the state buying land in the territory. Many Kashmiris believed this was crucial to protecting the demography of the Muslim-majority state and its way of life.The ruling Bharatiya Janata party repeatedly promised to scrap such rules, a long-term demand of its Hindu nationalist support base. But analysts warned doing so would almost certainly ignite unrest.On Monday 5 August 2019, the government issued a presidential order to abolish Kashmir’s special status. The government argued that the provision was only intended to be temporary and that scrapping it would boost investment in Kashmir. Critics, however, said the move would escalate tensions with Pakistan – which quickly called India’s actions illegal – and fuel resentment in Kashmir, where there is an insurgency against Indian rule.There has been an armed insurgency against Indian rule over its section of Kashmir for the past three decades. Indian soldiers and Pakistan-backed guerrillas fought a war rife with accusations of torture, forced disappearances and extra-judicial killing.Until 2004, the militancy was made up largely of Pakistani and Afghan fighters. Since then, especially after protests were quashed with\u0026nbspextreme force\u0026nbspin 2016, locals have made up a growing share of the anti-India fighters.For Indians, control of Kashmir – part of the country’s only Muslim-majority state – has been proof of its commitment to religious pluralism. For Pakistan, a state founded as a homeland for south Asian Muslims, it is the last occupied home of its co-religionists. Michael Safi and Rebecca Ratcliffe“Jamia Masjid old town Baramulla witnessed approx 10,000 people offering prayers,” the spokesperson said on Twitter. It was not immediately possible to independently confirm the claim.India’s foreign ministry shared photos of people visiting mosques, but a spokesman was not able to specify where the photos were taken within Jammu and Kashmir, which New Delhi downgraded from a state to two federal territories a week ago.The Kashmir police chief, Dilbagh Singh, said people “have been asked to offer prayers locally”. Shanawaz Shah, a local resident, told AFP: “I can’t believe we are forced to be in our homes on this festival. This is the festival of joy and happiness.”There is very little independent information about what is happening in Kashmir because of the communication blackout. Tens of thousands of troop reinforcements have flooded the main city of Srinagar and other Kashmir towns and villages.Last week police reportedly opened fire and used teargas to break up 10,000 protestors in Srinagar, the region’s main city, which took place after curfew rules were temporarily eased to allow people to attend Friday prayers. An Indian home affairs ministry official denied there were protests of any more than 20 people. The BBC later released a video showing huge crowds marching through the streets of Srinagar, as well as police opening fire and using teargas.Curfew rules were introduced in Kashmir on Monday last week, just hours before the government announced it would revoke the territory’s autonomy and rules that prevent outsiders from buying land. Many Kashmiris fear the move would alter the demography of India’s only Muslim-majority state and its traditions.It is unlikely people will be able to carry out many of the usual celebrations for Eid-al-Adha, one of the biggest events of the year in Kashmir. Typically, residents visit hundreds of neighbours, relatives and friends door-to-door to offer the meat of a sacrificed sheep or goat.The security lockdown appears to be aimed at avoiding a backlash in Kashmir, where most people oppose Indian rule, and is expected to last until Thursday, India’s independence day.Restrictions on movement were briefly lifted again over the weekend, allowing people to visit shops, but reimposed on Sunday afternoon. On TV news, jeeps were shown driving around the region, telling people to return to their homes and shopkeepers to shut markets.Associated Press contributed to this report"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/975263e356f9e9deac9b23a6c6e7597c23b8f47d/61_0_1798_1079/master/1798.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ad6abfeaf8c4b68ef7b6ca5218e97e84","title":"greenland residents traumatised by climate emergency","story":"Islanders are struggling to reconcile impact of global heating with traditional way of life, survey findsThe climate crisis is causing unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety to people in Greenland who are struggling to reconcile the traumatic impact of global heating with their traditional way of life.Scattered across 17 small towns and approximately 60 villages, all situated on a narrow coastal strip, Greenland’s residents have often been overlooked by data science. The island faces some of the most acute social issues in the world with high levels of alcoholism and historically disproportionate rates of suicide.According to its lead author, Kelton Minor, the survey finally gives Greenland’s most remote and inaccessible communities a voice on the climate crisis.“Therein lies the paradox: while satellites and sensors monitor the surface of Greenland’s ice sheet, chase icebergs and scan sea ice daily, relatively little is known about what the residents of Greenland think about their changing surroundings.”According to the data, detailed in a  investigation carried out across Greenland in the last month, the majority of local residents interviewed believe that the climate emergency will harm its people, sled dogs, plants and animals. The revelation contradicts arguments that local people believe climate breakdown will benefit the Arctic and raises concern over a growing mental health crisis around climate in the polar region.Minor said: “We find that a large majority of the Greenlandic population thinks that local sea ice has become more dangerous to travel on in recent years, suggesting that perceptions of growing risk are widespread for this important social, ecological and economic platform used by residents from all regions. Importantly, we find that residents are more likely to feel negative rather than positive sentiment when thinking about climate change, recent changes in sea ice, as well as glacial changes.”The survey is revealed as the Arctic faces potentially record warming levels. According to the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Colorado, US, Greenland has already lost more than 250bn tonnes from a combination of melt runoff and low total snowfall in July.For mental health professionals who specialise in the polar region, the latest survey findings from Greenland will present another red flag for the Arctic’s vulnerable Inuit communities. According to Courtney Howard, the board president of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, who lives and works in the Arctic, the intersection between the climate emergency and mental and physical health will become one of the world’s major issues.Howard said: “Temperature change is magnified in circumpolar regions. There is no question Arctic people are now showing symptoms of anxiety, ‘ecological grief’ and even post-traumatic stress related to the effects of climate change.“We are challenging the medical profession to acknowledge the world we are inheriting. Schools and universities aren’t considering how climate change will affect people, from a medical or a psychological perspective, so we are not training a new generation of medical professionals to help people in a fast-changing planet and this is intolerable. We are moving too slowly on this.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3983125.1565537933!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"exemption from irish to be made easier education sources say","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Joe McHugh: under the new rules students will be granted an exemption from the study of Irish “only in rare and exceptional circumstances”.  Photograph: Alan Betson Pupils will be able to secure exemptions from the study of Irish without requiring psychologists’ reports under new changes being introduced from the start of the school year.It follows a Department of Education review which found evidence that the system was being “gamed”, with psychologists being placed under pressure by parents to give exemptions to students who did not qualify for the opt-out.Under long-standing rules, Irish remains compulsory at primary and secondary school, but students are entitled to opt out if they have learning disabilities, special needs or have lived abroad for a long period.The changes mean pupils applying for exemptions on the grounds of disability or special needs will no longer require a psychologist’s report to back up their claims that they face special barriers in studying the language.Education sources say the changes will likely make it easier and more straightforward to secure exemptions and they expect numbers to rise.This is because some parents and students, especially in the run-up to the Leaving Cert, feel exemptions allow weaker Irish students to focus on other subjects.Some sources have also suggested that if there is significant growth in the number of exemptions it may trigger a new debate over the status of compulsory Irish.‘Fairer’ systemIn a statement, Minister for Education Joe McHugh said an overhaul of the system for granting exemptions from the study of Irish is long overdue. “By making key changes, the system will be fairer and more supportive of students while at the same time ensuring that all children have equal access to study the Irish language,” he said.He said that under the new rules students will be granted an exemption from the study of Irish “only in rare and exceptional circumstances”.Under the changes, the new criteria will only apply in English-medium schools.Students in special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools will not be required to apply for an exemption.Psychological assessments will no longer be necessary to process an application for an exemption.Age-related criteria for decisions on exemptions are being changed from 11 years of age to 12, which brings the circular into line with the final year of primary education.The decision to grant an exemption will continue to be made by the school principal.Mr McHugh said, under the revised rules, the decision to exempt a child should only be taken following detailed discussion with the student’s parent or , teacher, special education teachers and the student.Learning difficultiesFollowing a public consultation earlier this year on draft revisions to the system, he said revised circulars for primary and post-primary schools will take effect for the 20192020 school year.The public consultation on the issue of exemptions, which ran from December 2018 until January 2019, saw an unprecedented response with just over 11,000 iniduals sharing their views.The revised circular clarifies that an exemption may be granted in circumstances where students with significant learning difficulties have had access to a differentiated approach to language and literacy over time. In such instances, it says an application for exemption may be considered when a student has at least reached second class and at the time of the application for exemption presents with a standardised score on a discrete test in word reading or reading comprehension or spelling at or below the 10th percentile.It states that a pupil’s IQ is no longer to be used as a diagnostic specifier. Based on the draft revised circulars, psychological assessments will no longer be necessary to process applications for exemption from the study of Irish. The revised circulars make provision for the appeal of a school’s refusal to grant an exemption for the first time."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3945514.1565349854!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert results and cao helpdesk your questions answered","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Results Helpdesk guidance counsellors Deirdre Garrett and Brian Howard work to answer questions. Photograph: Sara Freund There are three guarantees in life: death, taxes and the inevitability that some students will be upset or confused about their Leaving Cert results. We can’t help you with the first two, sorry. But, from August 13th, The  free online exam helpdesk is here to answer questions from parents and teens about the implications that the 2019 Leaving Cert results might have for them.The helpdesk will be manned by Deirdre Garrett and Brian Howard, who are both members of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors. Garrett is a guidance counsellor at St Paul’s Secondary School in Monasterevin while Howard is a guidance counsellor at Newbridge College.Our guidance counsellors aim to respond to all your online queries within half an hour but, particularly on results day itself, the huge volume of queries means it can take longer before they get back to everyone. Due to changes in how the exam results are being delivered this year, there may be fewer guidance counsellors in some schools – and students and parents may be more likely than ever to contact The  helpdesk.“We’ve never had a question we don’t have the answer to, but if we didn’t know, we find out,” says Garrett. “Our key advice: stay calm, research your options and if you feel you don’t know what your options are, get on to the helpdesk.”What sort of questions does the helpdesk receive, and how do they answer them?Queries tend to be similar from one year to the next but, with the introduction this year of an online portal where students will be able to access their results online from as early as 10am, Howard anticipates a larger-than-usual volume of calls about the new system.Last year, a student missed out on a place on a veterinary medicine course in UCD as a result of examiners incorrectly totting up her points. She took a High Court case and won, prompting the State Examinations Commission to undertake a reform of the system so that other students wouldn’t go through the same ordeal.“As a result, there’s a new student support portal and every student has been given a PIN number and encouraged to register with this,” says Howard. “From 10am, they can go online and get their results. This will probably mean that fewer students go to their school to collect the results. The possible downside is that students don’t have immediate access to the school’s principal and guidance counsellors if they go online, but the upside is that, this year, they will get the results and CAO offers much faster, and the appeals process will be sped up too. They will only have to wait two days between results and CAO offers. Students will also get a breakdown of how they did in the different parts of the exams, including orals and practicals, and be allocated a time to go back to the school and view their scripts.”This year, scripts for some exams were scanned and marked online, and students will be able to view these through the portal.When the CAO first moved online, it was dogged by crashes, and there’s a possibility the volume of students logging on could cause delays.What if students have lost their log-in details for the new portal? “They will have to go back to where they sat the exam,” says Howard.2. Confusion over Hear and Dare offers3. Why didn’t I get a place? Minimum entry requirementsIf a student was exempt from Leaving Cert Irish and got the required CAO points for their chosen course in a NUI college but hadn’t applied for the exemption or let the college know, then they will be considered as not having met the minimum entry requirements. The same could apply if they don’t have a European language when applying to another university.Hope is not lost, however: they could still get in on round two.“Sometimes parents contact the helpdesk because they’re not sure of how to add up the points, especially for the Leaving Cert Vocational Programme,” says Howard. “For the LCVP, you add up the points for the six best subjects and, if the points for the LCVP are among your six best, leave them in – if not, take them out and replace them with the points for your next highest grade.”There’s a big misconception about bonus points for honours maths. “You only get 25 bonus points if maths is one of your six best subjects,” Howard says.The exam helpdesk receives a lot of queries about the dates for viewing scripts and when rechecks will be completed. Students will have received an exam handbook with all the information needed, and it can also be downloaded as a PDF from Examinations.ie – The  helpdesk can provide information too.Students only need to wait two days for their offer this year, but there’s very understandable anxiety for those who aren’t confident of getting the course they hoped for. And when the offers do come out, some will be disappointed.The  guidance counsellors will be on hand to talk students through their options, which include the pros and cons of repeating details of PLCs and how they can be a route into a college course apprenticeships and training studying abroad and the value of other options, including a year out.The helpdesk receives queries from students who applied for medicine and want to know if they are in with a chance of an offer.7. Have points but not minimum entry requirementsA student could get 550 points and still miss out on a course that only requires 500 points. “This could happen if, for instance, they applied for primary school teaching but didn’t get a H4 in Irish,” Garrett explains. “We advise that they have the option of only repeating Irish they could study in their own time while doing a PLC course or working.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3983335.1565563148!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervicalcheck longer wait for smear test results possible as lab exits programme","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMedLab cleared its 55,000 backlog of slides last week, the company confirmed on Sunday, and is no longer carrying out work for CervicalCheck.Women may once again have to wait longer to have their smear tests examined under the State’s cervical cancer screening programme following the exit of the main Irish-based laboratory from the programme.The capacity available to CervicalCheck to process tests has been greatly reduced after MedLab Pathology, based in Sandyford, south Dublin, completed its work for the programme last week.Since May 1st, MedLab has focused exclusively on clearing its share of a massive backlog in the programme, which at one point was causing delays of more than 33 weeks in providing smear test results to women. Since then, the Health Service Executive contracted another lab, Quest Diagnostics, to expand its work for the programme by processing new slides that would formerly have been dealt with by MedLab.MedLab succeeded in clearing its 55,000 backlog of slides last week, the company confirmed yesterday, and is no longer carrying out work for CervicalCheck. Its work over the past three months explains the fall in the overall backlog in recent months, from 81,000 in March to 28,000 last week.Remaining backlogIt is unclear, however, whether the remaining capacity in the system is sufficient to ensure the remaining backlog is cleared and to ensure wait times do not increase. Despite the fall in overall numbers on the waiting list, the waiting time for results appears to be edging up. Last week, the HSE said it was taking up to 14 weeks and, in some cases, longer for women to get their smear test results, an increase from 13 weeks reported in April. Quest, based in the US, is now responsible for processing 90 per cent of CervicalCheck slides. However, there have been a number of IT-related controversies affecting the scheme recently. A lab at the Coombe hospital in Dublin processes 10 per cent of the slides but sources say the speed at which it can handle these tests has greatly reduced since the High Court ruling in the Ruth Morrissey case last May. ‘Absolute certainty’Mr Justice Kevin Cross’s finding that screeners must have “absolute certainty” before giving a smear the all-clear has caused widespread concern among those involved in screening, who say it imposes a standard for negligence that is incompatible with a screening programme. An appeal by the State, Quest and MedLab will be heard by the Supreme Court in November.The HSE said last week the labs were making “steady progress” in processing all outstanding tests.MedLab’s Sandyford facility continues to handle private work as well as testing samples for other screening programmes, including BowelScreen, but the end of its decade-long association with CervicalCheck is likely to lead to layoffs.The backlog for processing CervicalCheck tests is largely due to a Government decision last year to provide women with free out-of-cycle smears. This was done to allay women’s fears after it emerged last year that hundreds of women with cervical cancer had not been told of a retrospective audit of their earlier smears.The decision continues to have repercussions in the system, most recently in the form of increased pressures on the State’s 15 colposcopy units. The HSE has been unable to say how long women whose smear tests show cell changes are having to wait to be seen for colposcopy."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"We talk to our career guidance counsellors about the most common queries they receive \u0026ndash and how they answer themSchool principals to decide on basis of standardised testsSuspect in his 30s held in connection with incident at house in Blackrock on FridayJoe McHugh pledges university registration fees will not exceed \u0026euro3,000 if FG returnedthe term had the advantage that it avoided ascribing blame to any of the participantsBrinkmanship represents \u0026lsquomassive working capital drag on business\u0026rsquo, trade body saysLarge guns must be stripped down for maintenance every three monthsEyewitness to August 1969: Civil rights campaigner Dermie McClenaghan80,000 households expected to face annual charge of up to \u0026euro500 for excessive useStudy links disparity to socioeconomic disadvantage and poor complianceCapacity may not be sufficient to clear backlog left as MedLab ends involvementStudents who appeal grades set to receive results three weeks earlier than normalIssuance of Irish passports to people living in North has risen significantlyA Parent\u0026rsquos Diary: \u0026lsquoWe are awaiting decisions about the future that are out of our hands\u0026rsquoDocuments released under FoI show those with highest spending on Oireachtas servicePsychological assessments no longer necessary to process applications for study opt-outGovernment accused of \u0026lsquoprogressively destroying the fabric of hospital services\u0026rsquoPreviously unpublished report claims 50-60 people would have died without volunteer efforts"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3983228.1565546595!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"germany seeks to reclaim weimar republic from fascism that followed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGoethe House, Weimar: at its best, the republic enshrined human rights and, at its worst, left ajar a door to the instability that aided Hitler’s rise to power in 1933. Photograph:  Klassik Stiftung WeimarGermany’s far-right populists are on the rise, as are random, violent street killings. People are dizzy with the potential – and danger – of new mass media. And, all over Berlin, posters have gone up for the Moka Efti orchestra.What sounds like an episode of the crime drama series Babylon Berlin, shining a light on the dingy corners of the interwar German capital, is, in fact, Berlin 2019.A century ago, on August 14th, the so-called Weimar Republic came into being after the constitution drafted and agreed in the city of Goethe was formally adopted.Germany’s first experiment in democracy collapsed 14 years later, triggering nearly six decades of fascism, war, ision and peaceful unification. But now, before gearing up to celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Germans are taking stock of the dark and light of their Weimar legacy.The challenge of this centenary: to try to look at the history without the benefit of hindsight.At a recent centenary celebration in Weimar, President Frank Walter Steinmeier insisted the Weimar Republic was more than a “one-way street”, an inevitable slide towards economic chaos, Hitler’s Nazi “barbarity” and six million Holocaust dead.“We should no longer view the Weimar Republic only from its end,” said Steinmeier.‘Turning point’It was in Weimar that delegates gathered from February 1919 to draft Germany’s first democratic constitution, after the war defeat, the collapse of the German monarchy and bloody battles for power on the streets of the capital.Steinmeier insisted the Weimar constitution was a “turning point in German history” that, at its best, enshrined human rights and, at its worst, left ajar a door to the instability that aided Hitler’s rise to power in 1933.For chancellor Angela Merkel, the lesson of Weimar is that “every generation must once again struggle for democracy”. With populist leaders on the rise around the world, her remark was no empty turn of phrase.The 1919 constitution was a landmark, giving German women the vote for the first time. Social Democrat Friedrich Ebert, in his first address as president, told Germans that the constitution gave citizens “direct rights of referenda, legislature, also as referee when the political forces fight . . . all of this is more strongly institutionalised than in any other constitution”.But the same document also handed considerable powers to the president, foresaw no threshold to enter parliament and permitted the suspension of rights under vague “emergency” powers. These flaws – combined with swingeing reparation costs and external economic shocks from the 1929 Wall Street crash – overwhelmed the political system.After 13 years of street battles – with the police, the communists and other enemies – the Nazis came out on top in 1933 elections, secured power and began dismantling the very constitution that helped them to power.Now, across a very different Germany, the interwar republic is being celebrated – even reclaimed – from the shadow of the subsequent fascist dictatorship.Weimar, the city of the republic’s birth, is championing its other legacy from the same era: the progressive Bauhaus school of design that can still be seen in everything from Ikea to the iPhone.Exhibits from eraBerlin’s Historical Museum (DHM) has put on a landmark show of 250 exhibits from the era showing how modern and forward-thinking the first German democracy was. Visitors can explore a modern fitted kitchen plans for new apartment blocks with air and light-filled courtyards to counteract TB rampant in older blocks and family planning pamphlets urging young people to “not go blindly into marriage”.The new medium of radio features prominently with recordings of discussions by guests including the physicist Albert Einstein that capture the buzz of the new medium – and its accelerating effect on contemporary society.Pride of place is given to Dr Magnus Hirschfeld, who founded an institution in Weimar-era Berlin researching the complexity of human sexuality – until the building and its research were destroyed by the fascists.The recent success of Babylon Berlin has sparked an explosion of interest in the Weimar era and the real-life band from Babylon Berlin’s fictional Moka Efti club is on tour.The highlight of each concert is singer Severija Janušauskaite, who appears in the show as drag-loving Russian countess Svetlana Sorokina, delivering her hypnotic rendition of the song Zu Asche, zu Staub (To Ashes, to Dust).For Berlin museum director Raphael Gross, the lesson from the republic’s failure is that successful democracy requires compromise that serves all. Failure on this front, with a nod to modern-day politics, opens the door to populist dictatorship of strong leaders and easy answers to complex problems.“Part of democracy is being aware that however much one is convinced of one’s own position, nobody can be as confident of the truth as if they were God,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed really goes recycling rubbish behind scenes","story":"The chaos of Britain’s recycling system is exposed today with hundreds of thousands of tons of waste being redirected to landfill or incinerators.Despite residents sorting their household waste into separate bins, up to half of “recyclable” material is not being recycled in some areas of England, government data shows.It comes as an undercover investigation by The  and Unearthed reveals staff at a recycling centre in London are sending recyclable plastic and paper to be incinerated.Today, The  launches a Zero Waste campaign calling on the Government, local councils and private companies to do more to boost the country’s lacklustre recycling rates.It is backed by Boris Johnson...To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Justice Secretary risks Brexiteer anger as he restates belief that no-deal will cause \u0026#39chaos\u0026#39Jeffrey Epstein: Who is embroiled in sex scandal - and why are there conspiracy theories over his death?Parents warned not to allow their children to travel in Ubers alone as drivers complain they are under pressure to break rulesGran Canaria wildfire forces evacuation of 1,000 and spreads towards popular holiday area\u0026#39Chicken shop\u0026#39 gangs recruit children with offers of free food, say charity chiefsUK weather: Britain set for summer misery with rain forecast for rest of week and commuters warned of disruptionVersace apologises in China over T-shirts identifying Hong Kong and Macao as countries Ghislaine Maxwell: The British socialite at the centre of Jeffrey Epstein sex scandalIrish PM refuses to back down over the backstop ahead of talks with Boris JohnsonComment: No wonder they\u0026#39re worried about exams - we\u0026#39ve robbed our children of the gift of independence\tBritish academics call on University of Hong Kong not to dismiss jailed law professorThe Queen shows support for Duke of York amid Jeffrey Epstein scandalHong Kong violence escalates as police and protesters clash in metro stationsFour in five UK airports increase \u0026#39kiss and fly\u0026#39 charges, according to studyGP waiting time breaches two weeks for first time, as new housing developments blamed for pressure on surgeriesRailway station ticket barriers could be replaced by sensors which detect when passengers board trainsParents using garlic and mayonnaise to try and get rid of their children\u0026#39s head lice, report finds Theresa May could snub Philip Hammond from resignation honours after \u0026#39frustrating premiership\u0026#39, it is claimedSerious offenders face longer jail sentences in crackdown by Boris Johnson on soft justiceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"best telegraph audio inside fortnite world cup future fast food","story":"Every Friday the  will bring you a selection of our best articles, comment pieces and features in audio form to be listened to at your convenience.Following the new Prime Minister\u0027s visits to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, Philip Johnston writes that a radical new plan might be required to keep the Union together.Kyle Giersdorf might not be a name many people know, but the 16-year-old gamer recently became £2.4m richer after becoming the Fortnite world champion.

The motherland\u0027s sovereignty and territorial integrity are sacred and inviolable, the studio\u0027s statement read in part.The offending T-shirt identified Beijing and Shanghai as in China but Macao and Hong Kong as separate countriesVersace said the shirts had been removed from all sales channels on July 24 and destroyed.It\u0027s our company\u0027s negligence and we express deep apology for the impact it caused, it said on Weibo. Versace reiterates that we love China and resolutely respect China\u0027s territory and sovereignty.Donatella Versace, sister of the fashion house’s late founder Gianni, issued a similar statement on her official Instagram account, apologising for any distress and insisting she had never wanted to disrespect China\u0027s National Sovereignty.Versace is not the first foreign company to face flak over how it describes Hong Kong. China has pressured international airlines and other companies to describe the city as Hong Kong, China on their websites, rather than just as Hong Kong. The latest flap comes at a sensitive time for China, as pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong are motivated in large part by a desire to protect their way of life from interference by the central government in Beijing. Justice Secretary risks Brexiteer anger as he restates belief that no-deal will cause \u0026#39chaos\u0026#39Jeffrey Epstein: Who is embroiled in sex scandal - and why are there conspiracy theories over his death?Parents warned not to allow their children to travel in Ubers alone as drivers complain they are under pressure to break rulesGran Canaria wildfire forces evacuation of 1,000 and spreads towards popular holiday area\u0026#39Chicken shop\u0026#39 gangs recruit children with offers of free food, say charity chiefsUK weather: Britain set for summer misery with rain forecast for rest of week and commuters warned of disruptionGhislaine Maxwell: The British socialite at the centre of Jeffrey Epstein sex scandalIrish PM refuses to back down over the backstop ahead of talks with Boris JohnsonComment: No wonder they\u0026#39re worried about exams - we\u0026#39ve robbed our children of the gift of independence\tBritish academics call on University of Hong Kong not to dismiss jailed law professorThe Queen shows support for Duke of York amid Jeffrey Epstein scandalHong Kong violence escalates as police and protesters clash in metro stationsFour in five UK airports increase \u0026#39kiss and fly\u0026#39 charges, according to studyGP waiting time breaches two weeks for first time, as new housing developments blamed for pressure on surgeriesRailway station ticket barriers could be replaced by sensors which detect when passengers board trainsParents using garlic and mayonnaise to try and get rid of their children\u0026#39s head lice, report finds Theresa May could snub Philip Hammond from resignation honours after \u0026#39frustrating premiership\u0026#39, it is claimedSerious offenders face longer jail sentences in crackdown by Boris Johnson on soft justiceLabour could bring an end to the \u0026#39Glorious Twelfth\u0026#39 as it calls for review into grouse shootingWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2019/08/08/TELEMMGLPICT000166955495_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqlZ9johlWGFSeShMcoPCPXZfOPKIOZn3kWR549NEUVrM.jpeg?imwidth","title":"would best placed lead government national surrender","story":"Cardboard cutouts of anti-Brexit MPs, including Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve are presented by pressure group Avaaz outside ParliamentWe need someone with a real track record of trying to make the United Kingdom unworkable I am enjoying this talk of a Government of National Unity as the solution to our Brexit ills.

A crucial first step would be to automatically issue all necessary companies with an EORI number to minimise the hoops that firms need to jump through to be ready for day one.“There are many fundamental outstanding questions relating to the rules and processes of trade in the event of no deal.“While the Department for International Trade has been working with third countries to ensure the rollover of existing FTAs, many of these critical arrangements have not yet been formally agreed, and firms can’t plan for the future based on warm words. Maintaining preferential access to countries where the EU has trade agreements is critical to maintaining competitiveness in key markets.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It was how they were produced and how people used them when they got to the UK that matters. So that was a real eye-opener.”Most of this comes from\u0026nbspfertilisers,\u0026nbsppesticides and the fuel used by machinery during harvesting.They are then processed and sorted. If the orange is used to make juice, 22 per cent of the total footprint is down to transport and distribution.Professor Reay said: “If you just assume everything closer to you is better, so if you’re thinking these blueberries or cucumber from Holland in January will be low carbon, they\u0026nbspwon’t be. It’s going to be intensive production with a high carbon footprint.“This will massively outweigh the food miles of bringing them\u0026nbspfrom a country where the climate is right at that time of year.”Created with Sketch.Teenage climate change protesters threatened with arrest at Heathrow  Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Four teenage protesters, holding a banner reading “Are we the last generation”Police surround the protestersFour teenage protesters, holding a banner reading “Are we the last generation”Police surround the protestersAccording to government data, buying a tomato grown in the UK has three times the footprint of a tomato grown in Spain.Lettuces grown in the UK during winter are cultivated in poly tunnels which require\u0026nbsplots of energy to keep them warm. In terms of carbon emissions, it is more environmentally friendly to buy them from Spain during the winter and in the UK during the summer.But food miles do matter if the product has been transported by air. For this reason, Professor Reay says consumers should avoid eating out-of-season soft fruit such as raspberries and blueberries.A 100g box of blueberries\u0026nbspgrown locally or imported via ship will produce around 100g of carbon dioxide. If it’s flown in, that increases by ten times, pushing its carbon footprint up to more like 1kg.Destruction of land must stop to tackle climate change, says reportClimate change could cause toxic mercury to accumulate in seafood“If you want to go into the high carbon footprint foods then once it’s been air freighted you’re in real trouble. That’s when the food miles absolutely soar in terms of emissions. We should have a blanket ban on air freight,” said Professor\u0026nbspReay.Despite the fiendishly difficult business of counting carbon he says the message “buy local” needs to go with “in season”. \u0026nbsp“The food mile message is a little more nuanced than it’s sometimes presented,” he added.Reducing waste would also make a significant difference to the carbon footprint.According to 2017 research, food waste accounts for 8 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions. If food waste were a country it would come behind China and the US as the largest emitters on the planet.Professor Derek Stewart, an agri-food sector expert from the James Hutton Institute, said the book was interesting but some of the data could be challenged, notably on the grounds that it only looked at carbon dioxide emissions.Ships use dirty fuels that emit nitrogen and sulphur as well as carbon dioxide which has a significantly larger greenhouse gas impact than carbon dioxide alone, he said.PMQsProfessor Stewart added: “The carbon footprint is too nebulous for most people and in fact forms only part of a food supply chain.”Dr Eugene Mohareb, a lecturer in sustainable urban systems at the University of Reading, commended the overall analysis of food miles and the impacts of production.“In an ideal world, embodied carbon from production and transport would be communicated to the consumer on food products so that they could make informed decisions. But in the absence of that, eating produce in season can be a good guide,” he said.Food systems contribute to between 20 and 30 per cent of emissions globally and Dr Mohareb says the UK is unlikely to reach net zero by 2050 unless these emissions are reduced.“There are many things that we as consumers can do to reduce this impact. For example, we found that a simple measure, such as using grocery delivery instead of collecting by car just half of the time, reduced someone’s total impact on the food system by around half a percentage point,” he said.Eating vegetarian\u0026nbspone day a week could reduce someone’s overall impact by around 4 per cent.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.22. When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.21. Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.423 Avengers: Age of Ultron20. Just in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.19. Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.18. A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 723 s of the Galaxy Vol 217. The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.16. Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.15. Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1023 Ant-Man and the Wasp14. While the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.13. What comes after the end? It’s the question that was hanging over the Marvel Cinematic Universe ever since the release of Avengers: Endgame was sold to us as the ultimate, cumulative chapter in a series of 22 interconnected films. And yet, while Far From Home is distinctly mid-level Marvel fare, there’s a lot to be said for the fact it isn’t crushed under the weight of its own ambitions. It feels comfortably like the end of a chapter, the beginning of a new one, an epilogue, and a palate cleanser all at once. It also works perfectly well as a film about Spider-Man.12. Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. 11. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.10. With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.9. Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. 8. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.7. While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.6. While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.5. It’s a film that’s hard to place within the MCU canon, simply because the majority of its emotional pay-offs only work due to the groundwork laid by over a decade of filmmaking. Avengers: Endgame is less about inidual storytelling and so much more about the collective experience of cinema itself. This exists to be consumed in the dark, surrounded by loved ones, as  you all cheer, gasp, and cry in unison. The fan service at work may, at times, feel a little outrageous in just how bold it feels, but Endgame earns the right to indulge. This, above all, is a celebration of these movies and their impact on the world. 4. Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.3. Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2223 s of the Galaxy 2. Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.1. Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.23. Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke).

Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk. HOStanley Kubrick’s creep-show classic is remembered for the indelible images of that violent finale chase, but its reputation and influence stem from the slow-winding tension that precedes it. Jack Nicholson is the struggling writer whose sanity frays over a winter season at an isolated and haunted hotel Shelley Duvall plays his increasingly desperate wife. Touching on questions of domestic violence as well as delivering a ghost story for the ages, this will get under your skin and stay there. HO742 Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978)One of those remakes that justifies remakes, Philip Kaufman’s beautifully skilful spin on the McCarthy-era alien-clone thriller translates it wickedly to the psychobabble age of the 1970s, with a bit of post-Watergate panic thrown in. Donald Sutherland’s lugubrious health inspector is a nicely grumpy enemy of the pod people, and the hysteria ratchets up masterfully. PSWes Anderson\u0027s meticulously mannered and beautifully composed films are not to all tastes, but when combined with a cast of this calibre and a more-than-usually heartfelt script, they are capable of magic. Gene Hackman plays the disgraced patriarch of a family of geniuses, making one last attempt at redemption. With a who’s who of Hollywood in support, it’s a story that is as bizarre, hilarious and moving as family life itself. HO942 Lawrence of Arabia (1962)David Lean’s First World War epic about TE Lawrence remains a filmmaking milestone, the movie that Steven Spielberg rewatches before starting each new film. Its genius is to combine huge scale battles – notably the attack on Aqaba – with psychological insight into the toll that the war took on Lawrence’s mind. The white-led casting of Arab characters is appalling to modern eyes, but with its daring, dazzling filmmaking it remains one to watch despite that. HOA devastating portrait of the poverty trap, Vittorio De Sica’s neo-realist masterpiece remains all too relevant. Antonio (Lamberto Maggiorani) is offered a desperately-needed job – but it requires a bicycle, and when his is stolen he and his son resort to desperate measures to get it back. Shot with non-professional actors who lived in circumstances close to that of their characters, this is a study in compassion and empathy. HOSpanning five decades of Chinese history, this sprawling epic follows two stars of the Peking Opera from harsh childhood training through the perils of the Second World War, the Communist takeover and the Cultural Revolution. Director Chen Keige drew on his own experience of the Cultural Revolution to shape this groundbreaking, tormented romance both between Zhang Fengyi’s Ziaolou and Leslie Cheng’s Dieyi, and between Ziaolou and his former prostitute wife Juxian (Gong Li). HOOriginally titled 1984½, Terry Gilliam’s crazily ambitious riff on Orwell is a dystopian comedy about a world stuffed to bursting point: one clerical error and it threatens to burst, plunging Jonathan Pryce’s befuddled low-level bureaucrat into madness and chaos. A nightmare of retro-futuristic oppression, outfitted with mad bravura and some of the best sci-fi production design ever. PSPauline Kael thought that the basic appeal of movies was the “kiss kiss bang bang” of action and romance, but Yasujirō Ozu demonstrates that film is capable of much more in this quiet family drama. It’s a simple story about two elderly parents visiting their adult children, only to find that the younger generation is busy with other things. But it’s also a meditation on the passing of time, and on grief, and on the constant push towards the new that will break your heart every time you watch it. HOIf we have learned anything from film noir, it is that murder pacts never work out well for both parties. That’s certainly the lesson when Fred MacMurray’s infatuated salesman offers life insurance to Barbara Stanwyck’s femme fatale Phyllis against her unloved husband. The scheme gives way to a riveting stew of suspicion and paranoia, with Stanwyck’s ruthless determination warping MacMurray’s Neff out of all recognition as director Billy Wilder tightens the screws. HO1542 Days of Heaven (1978)Terrence Malick’s second, and for many, greatest film is a mesmerisingly gorgeous love triangle set in the Texas Panhandle in 1916, loosely based on an Old Testament parable. Richard Gere and Brooke Adams are the lovers who pose as brother and sister to fool a rich, dying farmer (Sam Shepard). Nestor Almendros’s astounding magic-hour photography rightly won an Oscar, and Linda Manz supplies heartbreaking, plainspoken narration as Gere’s younger sister. PSThe problem with calling something “the greatest film ever made” is that it begins to sound like homework. Forget that: beyond all the technical dazzle and ground-breaking filmmaking Orson Welles’s masterpiece has red blood in its veins and a huge beating heart. What’s more, its portrait of a thrusting, occasionally demagogic tycoon and the hollowness at the heart of his success remains as relevant as it ever was, and the suggestion that America might be susceptible to media manipulation all too believable. HONirvana and despair among a troupe of 19th century theatre actors, in Marcel Carné\u0027s luminously moving epic of the heart. This not only represents the full flowering of French cinema\u0027s Golden Age, but a gracious look back at the performing traditions film was built on. It’s peopled with some of the most touchingly clownish characters you’ll ever see. PSWhether you see it as Alfred Hitchcock’s celebration of voyeurism or simply one of the most nail-biting thrillers ever made, it’s a superb example of the Master of Suspense at work. James Stewart’s photographer, laid up with a broken leg, becomes obsessed with the lives of his neighbours and suspects one of murder. The unusually vulnerable hero – as in Vertigo – increases the stakes and ensures that simple brawn won’t save the day, while Hitchcock ratchets up the tension unbearably by putting Grace Kelly’s plucky girlfriend in the lion’s mouth. HOClaudette Colbert\u0027s eloping heiress and Clark Gable\u0027s hack on his uppers warily team up on a Greyhound bus, only to aggravatingly fall for each other. Frank Capra\u0027s evergreen romcom all but invented the love-hate formula that\u0027s one model for silver screen chemistry, hoicking up Colbert\u0027s skirt to flash a leg when they need to hitch-hike, and dismantling Gable\u0027s smarmy defences. The biggest hit of its day for a reason, it was also the first ever film to win the big five at the Oscars. PSThe trials of young black basketball hopefuls in Chicago tell us volumes, from their upbringing to all-or-nothing career rimshots, about the opportunities otherwise denied them. For these portraits of inner-city poverty, gliding between frustration and triumph, Steve James’s epic of ghetto realities has been influential on every sports doc that has come in its wake. The Academy’s documentary branch will never quite live down failing to nominate it. PSThis blistering Billy Wilder and IAL Diamond script is a demonstration of just how dark a love story can be get without tipping entirely into bitterness, a standing rebuke to every lazy, schmaltzy comedy going. While the entire cast is stellar and Shirley MacLaine was never better, it’s worth ignoring them all and just watching Jack Lemmon’s meek office worker CC Baxter. Every gesture and glance is flawless he carries entire scenes without a word. HOThe title of Wim Wenders’s Palme d’Or-winning emotional odyssey is both a real place and a broken state of mind. The missing Travis (Harry Dean Stanton) is found wandering there in a battered cap, and begins a trek to make amends with his ex (Nastassja Kinski), whom he finds, oblivious to who he is, on the other side of a Houston peepshow window. Culminating unforgettably with this long-take tête-a-tête, it\u0027s a mesmerising quest for redemption, with a Ry Cooder score that will twang its way into your soul. PSIt’s encouraging how many obituarists of Philip Seymour Hoffman identified this as his masterwork – literally the performance of a lifetime. The meta-theatrical conceit – Caden Cotard is constructing a play about his life, which becomes as long as his life – lets Charlie Kaufman unleash a panoply of ideas about creativity, self-worth, love, death, everyday and lifelong terrors. It’s bruisingly honest, and a shattering experience for the faithful. PSCéline (Julie Delpy) and Jesse (Ethan Hawke) have settled down since the two earlier films in Richard Linklater’s essential trilogy, Before Sunrise (1995) and Before Sunset (2004), but the problems in their lives – self-inflicted by now – only keep proliferating. Trenchantly pushing them into full-on battle-of-the-sexes territory, the film squares them off for a bitterly adult dissection of a long-term relationship, asking stark questions about love, compromise and lasting the course. PSOther Jean-Luc Godard films are punchier, ruder, more experimental. But this is his most lavish, measured, and sad: an elegiac fantasy of filmmaking, as a loose adaptation of the Odyssey grinds to a halt on Capri, with Jack Palance as the brash American producer trying to sell art by the yard. Meanwhile, the screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) and his beautiful, bored wife (Brigitte Bardot) tussle and reconcile in an incessant, pained ballet. PSSome films strain under the weight of greatness Casablanca’s quality bubbles through. Against the backdrop of the Second World War, two former lovers reunite though everything in the world is pulling them apart. Bogart’s Rick hides a huge heart under a thin veneer of cynicism opposite him Ingrid Bergman’s luminous Ilsa would melt an iceberg. Packed with quotable lines and brimming over with impeccable cool, here we are, still lookin\u0027 at you, kid. HO2742 Meet Me in St Louis (1944)On the surface, Vincente Minnelli\u0027s Technicolor classic is all sweetness and light: Judy Garland, the Trolley song, lots of dancing and tinsel. What makes this one of the great American musicals is an undertow of despair a mile wide. It\u0027s a nostalgia trip as subtly bitter as it is sugary and the subtext of “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” is anything but merry. PS2842 A Trip to the Moon (1902)Georges Méliès pioneered many of the visual and special effects techniques that have formed the backbone of fantastical filmmaking ever since, and he pushed them all to their limits in this turn-of-the-century tale of a rocket trip to the moon to meet the strange creatures who live upon it. Witty touches and a real sense of story mean that this is still entertaining more than a century later, and if the effects are less awe-inspiring now, they’re still beautifully designed and executed. HO2942 Out of the Past (1947)Cigarette smoke gives everyone a halo in this masterly, Jacques Tourneur-directed tale of a private investigator (Robert Mitchum) who can’t escape old associates – especially Kathie (Jane Greer), the doll-faced schemer who’s perhaps noir’s ultimate femme fatale. Aka Build My Gallows High, it’s a fatalistic masterpiece, with Kirk Douglas as the smarmy gangster setting Mitchum up for a fall. PSA screwball comedy of substance, Howard Hawks\u0027s remake of The Front Page is an objectively odd mix of high stakes and high comedy. Yet it works because the machine-gun dialogue is so quick that there\u0027s never a moment to question what’s happening (the great screenwriter Ben Hecht, who co-wrote the original Broadway play, worked on it uncredited). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell, as the warring editor and star-reporter trying to work together long enough to land the story of the year, remain the standard by which all on-screen chemistry should be judged. HOWho\u0027s eavesdropping on whom? Hatched before Watergate and speaking eerily to it, this audacious story of an obsessive surveillance whiz (a career-best Gene Hackman), commissioned to snoop but finding himself morally embroiled, is a slippery plunge into Seventies paranoia like no other. What a run Francis Ford Coppola had, slipping this one in between the first two Godfathers. PSJohn Travolta\u0027s Z-movie sound man, out recording one night, accidentally tapes what turns out to be a political assassination. Brian De Palma hit peak ingenuity and gut-punch profundity with this stunning conspiracy thriller, mounted with a showman\u0027s élan but also harrowing emotional voltage from its star. It’s one of the most delirious thrillers of the 1980s, with a bitterly ironic pay-off that’s played for keeps. PS3342 City of God (2002)There’s a deep contradiction at the heart of this acid-bright portrait of the violence in Rio’s favelas. On one hand these child hustlers and teen gangsters have an intense lust for life, an exuberance displayed in dance and play and love on the other, they value life cheaply and take it without a qualm. Director Fernando Meirelles and co-director Kátia Lund cast a talented band of local kids to give it authenticity and then punctuated their story with Scorsese-esque violence that still shocks. HO3442 Hannah and Her Sisters (1986)The erging romantic fortunes of Hannah (Mia Farrow), Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest, who won an Oscar, as did Michael Caine) provide an ideal structure for Woody Allen to check in on a midway state of adulthood, when there\u0027s already a sense of disappointment about squandered promise, but still much to play for. It hits the miraculous sweet spot between all Allen’s modes and tones. PSThe Coen Brothers had already established a ghoulish signature style with Blood Simple, but here they showed us how funny they could be, in a zig-zagging kidnap farce which manages the difficult feat of being both zany and adorable. Nicolas Cage and Holly Hunter are the unlikely couple whose abduction of a spare newborn quintuplet, Nathan Jr, causes all hell to break loose. PSThis looks and acts like a thriller, but in reality Michael Haneke’s exploration of colonialism, guilt, paranoia and privacy cares more about subtext than about scares or mystery. A well-to-do Parisian family are tormented by the arrival of surveillance tapes of their lives, but it’s not clear who could be sending them or why, leading patriarch Georges (Daniel Auteuil, never better) to confront his own past sins. As a subversion of genre and viewer expectation, there are few to match it. HOStraight up the best Bourne movie – an experience Ultimatum can’t help but want to repeat, more falteringly – because of Paul Greengrass’s phenomenal instincts for pace, Matt Damon’s unguessed flair for minimalism, and a script by Tony Gilroy that’s all about conscience. Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant. 142 Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981)With this update and upgrade of the 1930s serial adventure, Steven Spielberg turns what could have been pastiche into a practically perfect film. Harrison Ford’s daring archaeologist is almost always out of his depth but has impeccable underdog charm, and Douglas Slocombe’s casually stunning cinematography is matched by one of John Williams\u0027s finest scores. Indy is ultimately irrelevant to the entire plot, interestingly, but his indefatigable effort to do the right thing still inspires. HO242 The Wings of the Dove (1997)Henry James is notoriously difficult to adapt well, but here is the darkly shimmering exception. Helena Bonham Carter still hasn’t topped Kate Croy, conniving but also trapped by her circumstances, as a leading role the masquerade of her and Linus Roache\u0027s motives makes the film a psychological thriller of sorts. Iain Softley directs the Venice sequences with bewitching gamesmanship, then tears your heart out at the end. PSJapanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki\u0027s films delight kids with their bright colours, imaginative characters and plucky heroines (usually). But there\u0027s meat to their bones for adults to digest, especially in this towering fantasy epic. As young Chihiro takes a job in a mysterious bathhouse peopled by spirits in order to save her parents, viewers can explore everything from deeply rooted interpretations of traditional Japanese myth to Miyazaki\u0027s fascination with Western filmmaking and the Second World War. And visually it’s unparalleled. HOLuis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí changed the face of cinema with this 16-minute-long Surrealist short, instantly confronting the viewer with the sight of an eyeball being slit open. Narrative is jettisoned, and the unnerving power of juxtaposition championed in dreamlike montage, which still has a fizzing voltage and suggestive power. PSYes, but hear us out: Avengers is a grand experimental film. Marvel risked four popular franchises on this superhero throw of the dice, something never attempted in cinema history. They won, and made the fizzing chemistry of the unlikely gang who must save us from aliens look easy. But the failure of every Marvel imitator since makes clear how impressive this billion-dollar gamble really was, and how difficult it is to tell character-driven stories in blockbuster cinema on this scale. And as a bonus, it has a Hulk.

Barring Mad Max: Fury Road, it’s the best and most enduring action movie of the present millennium. PSOrson Welles suggested that Buster Keaton’s silent Civil War comedy might be the greatest film ever made, and who are we to argue? Keaton’s Johnny Gray is a key figure on the railroads of the Confederacy, but he and his engine, The General, must go above and beyond to defeat a Union spy. Ignore the dodgy politics and focus on the sublime physical comedy of Keaton’s beautifully composed routines. You’ll come out wondering if movies even need sound. HOThe Babadook is a black, hunched pop-up book monster who raps on your door three times before paying a visit. And you can’t get rid of him. Widowed mum Amelia (brilliant Essie Davis) can’t remember reading his book to her emotionally disturbed misfit of a son (Noah Wiseman) before. Jennifer Kent’s thoughtful Australian chamber shocker, a feast of inventive design, claws its way into you and leaves scratch marks. PSIs it impossible for men and women to be purely platonic? It is according to Harry, in this beautiful, brainy comedy about two neurotic New Yorkers who become friends and then more. Directed by Rob Reiner and written by wonderful Nora Ephron, it\u0027s a paean of sorts to Woody Allen\u0027s early films, with razor-sharp observations about sex and dating (I\u0027ll have what she\u0027s having). It\u0027s still the pinnacle of both Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan\u0027s careers. Toy Story revolutionised animation Up and Wall-E vie for the best opening of any film this century, but for sheer audacity Pete Docter’s head-trip must prevail. As a little girl struggles to adapt following a family move across country, her emotions go on a madcap adventure through the mind itself. What’s dazzling here is that two completely separate films unfold at once. Kids watch brightly coloured sprites on a quest adults watch a psychologically dense depiction of how we think and feel. It’s wonderful.Disinterred from a script Tarantino wrote in the mid-Eighties called The Open Road – the same screenplay that also spawned Natural Born Killers – Tony Scott\u0027s True Romance is a pulpy, hyperviolent twist on a damsel-in-distress fairytale, with a plinky-plonky score that is based on Badlands. Christian Slater and Patricia Arquette are the lovers on the lam, chased by Christopher Walken\u0027s suave mafioso. Bombastic, brash – and totally brilliant.

The balance of exporting manufacturers that have increased orders also fell to +9, down from +21 in the same quarter last year. In services, it fell to +5 from +14.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersUncertainty has increased significantly since the April to June period as the prospect of a no-deal Brexit has become more likely under Boris Johnson’s government.The BCC warned that many businesses are not ready for the “immediate and abrupt” changes that leaving the EU without a\u0026nbspdeal would bring.It urged the government to fast-track through paperwork that all UK businesses will need\u0026nbspto trade with the EU after Brexit.A “worryingly low” number of firms have obtained an “Economic Operators Registration and Identification” number\u0026nbsp(EORI), which is required for customs purposes, the BCC said.How badly could Brexit disrupt farming exports from Northern Ireland?Hannah Essex, co-executive director at the BCC, said: “There is real frustration among business communities across the UK at the lack of clarity about trading conditions after the UK leaves the EU, and we’re already seeing the impact of that uncertainty.“While the majority of firms want the government to avoid a messy and disorderly Brexit, we’re calling on the government to put practicalities first and implement measures to ensure firms are as prepared as possible for whatever scenario they face. A crucial first step would be to automatically issue all necessary companies with an EORI number to minimise the hoops that firms need to jump through to be ready for day one.“There are many fundamental outstanding questions relating to the rules and processes of trade in the event of no deal.“While the Department for International Trade has been working with third countries to ensure the rollover of existing FTAs, many of these critical arrangements have not yet been formally agreed, and firms can’t plan for the future based on warm words. Maintaining preferential access to countries where the EU has trade agreements is critical to maintaining competitiveness in key markets.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Pink Meanie was discovered during a nightlight jellyfish e by the collections team in the waters around Robben Island and in Cape Town Harbour. Pink Meanies are jellyvorous, meaning they feed on other jelly species by reeling them in with their long tentacles. Discovering the Pink Meanie in its early ephyra stage meant the team could study its growth rate which turned out to be very quick as it grew to the metaephyra stage in about a week and a half. The Mexican pink meanie (Drymonema larsoni) was only discovered in the year 2000. A Mediterranean relative, known as the Big Pink Jellyfish (Drymonema dalmatinum) has been known to science since the 1800s but when spotted in 2014 it had been almost 70 years since the last sighting.

He doesn’t waver. He just stays strong.”Makayla Meyer, 15, a Des Moines high school student, said she is attracted to Mr Sanders’ unapologetic push for his values.“There’s a lot of people who say America can’t be a socialist government, but Bernie stands by who he is,” she said.Jake Atkinson, 23, a recent university graduate\u0026nbspwho was visiting from London, said that the anger he sees in Mr Sanders can speak to people on a broad range\u0026nbspof issues, helping people\u0026nbspconnect them and understand the bigger picture\u0026nbsp— and thinks that’s how the Democrats can win the next presidential election.“He really nails the intersectionality of all the issues, and how they’re all related,” Mr Atkinson said. “I think that’s how we beat Republicans in 2020.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Arab, explains how he has lost $1000s of dollars being displaced due to the water crisis in Iraq (Photo: Bel Trew)A United Nations report released last month warned that the world is heading for a “climate apartheid” scenario, “where the wealthy pay to escape overheating, hunger and conflict while the rest of the world is left to suffer”.\u0026nbspIn Baghdad, that is already a reality. On 48C\u0026nbspdays, which are now coming earlier in the year, air conditioners are the most effective way of staying cool. But an electricity crisis in the country is putting even that essential tool out of reach to low-income families.\u0026nbspThe crisis – caused by a combination of corruption, mismanagement and a creaking national grid\u0026nbsp– has exacerbated the country’s energy ide. The result is a huge gap between electricity supply and demand, especially in the summer. A diesel generator can be used to meet some of the shortfall, but running an air conditioner from a generator is a luxury only a few can afford.\u0026nbsp“The electricity is completely unpredictable,” says Abu Ahmed, a metal shop owner just down the street from Muhammad. “Sometimes it comes on at 10am and lasts all day, sometimes it’s only one hour. The air conditioner is out of the question without the government grid.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAbu Ahmed pays around £50 a month to run a generator that gives him a supply of four amps of electricity. That is all he can afford. If he goes over the allotted amps, the power turns off. \u0026nbsp“I can run the fridge and the lights, that’s all,” he says. “I can’t sleep at night and I’m always sweating.”Boiling Basra: Iraq’s water crisis threatens to destabilise the regionIraq’s electricity crisis may be a local problem, but the inequality of keeping cool is a global issue that is likely to become more relevant as temperatures rise.\u0026nbspNearly 2.8 billion people live in countries where the average daily temperature is greater than 25C, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), and less than 10 per cent of them own an air conditioner. The agency estimates that by 2050, 1.9 billion people living in hot countries will be without access to an air conditioner.\u0026nbspProfessor Philip Alston, the UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights and author of the “climate apartheid” report, says the lives of the world’s poorest will be at risk.\u0026nbsp“The ever-higher record temperatures that will be recorded in Iraq and around the world will put vast numbers of vulnerable iniduals at grave risk. Children, older persons, those who are already ill or are just not very strong, will all be at risk of dying from excessive heat,” he tells The Independent.\u0026nbspAFPGetty)“The only way for some of these to get a degree of protection will be from air conditioning. But that costs money both for the system or the equipment as well as for electricity. The poorest people will often have neither access nor the money needed to have access to such relief.”\u0026nbspIraqi cities have some advantages over Europe when it comes to dealing with extreme temperatures. Its neighbourhoods and homes were designed with the heat in mind. Narrow streets carry the wind through tall windows, cool air flows up from the basements in older houses.\u0026nbspAs the recent heatwaves in Paris, London and Berlin have shown, European countries are significantly less well-equipped to deal with these higher temperatures.\u0026nbspLast month’s record-breaking temperature of 38.7C\u0026nbspin the UK prompted apocalyptic headlines, transport chaos and a spate of government health warnings –\u0026nbspand for good reason.\u0026nbspHigh temperatures in Europe are usually accompanied by a spike in deaths, usually among the elderly and people with heart and lung conditions. In 2003, a heatwave caused an additional 70,000 deaths across the continent. The British parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee has warned that Britain faces 7,000 heat-related deaths every year by 2050 unless action is taken.\u0026nbspAs it stands today, Europe is ill-prepared. The IEA estimates that less than 5 per cent of European households are air-conditioned, but it adds that air conditioning could become one of the top drivers of global electricity demand within a few decades.The UK’s Met Office describes heatwaves as “extreme weather events,” but adds that with climate change they are likely to become more frequent. Its own projections show that heatwaves could occur on average as regularly as every other year by the middle of the century.\u0026nbspChildren, older persons, those who are already ill or are just not very strong, will all be at risk of dying from excessive heatThe rise in temperature is likely to have an impact on how we work, too. According to the International Labour Organisation, the best-case scenario predictions for the level of warming would result in a 2.2 per cent reduction of global working hours due to heat stress by 2030, the equivalent of 80 million full-time jobs.\u0026nbspBut as Europe considers a future of climate crises, here again, Iraq is years ahead. Muhammad, the hardware store worker, knows very well how the heat can stop you in its tracks.\u0026nbsp“This job is easy, I don’t move around so much. But it takes an extra effort to do anything. Other jobs, like labouring, is much more difficult.”\u0026nbspAnd while European countries may at least have the time and means to adapt, Iraq is fast approaching an environmental disaster. \u0026nbspAFPGetty)A 2018,\u0026nbspreport produced by a group of academics from the EastWest Institute and the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) described Iraq as “one of the Middle East’s most climate-vulnerable countries”.“Climate change is currently manifesting itself in prolonged heat waves, erratic precipitation, higher than average temperatures and increased disaster intensity,” the report says, adding a prediction that the country’s mean annual temperature will increase by 2C\u0026nbspby 2050.Mahmoud Abdul Latif Hamed, a weather forecaster and manager of environment at Iraq’s Meteorological Organisation, says Iraq is experiencing extreme temperatures earlier in the year. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp“In 2011, the temperature in Baghdad reached 50C\u0026nbspin August. Now it’s June and the temperature in Baghdad is already 49C. That means there has been a two-month shift in reading the temperature,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Fifty degrees is very dangerous if you’re out in the open. For the poor it is even more dangerous. They have no air conditioning to cool down.”According to Hamed, there are things the government can do to deal with the extreme heat.\u0026nbsp“The ideal solution is to make more vegetation, which can lower temperatures. And we need to remove all the factories and old technology,” he says. \u0026nbspBut despite Iraq’s massive oil wealth, corruption is hampering reform and Iraqis are furious. Last summer, deadly protests erupted in the southern city of Basra over the government’s inability to provide reliable electricity and water. The government has promised to invest billions in improving the national grid, but few have noticed the difference so far.\u0026nbspProtesters have been back on the streets this year in anticipation of another sweltering summer.\u0026nbsp“We expect the future climate of Iraq to be very dangerous,” Hamed,\u0026nbspsays. “I expect that if the issue isn’t fixed, it will bring down the government.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They voted to leave the EU. The only problem, as we have since discovered, is that many MPs don’t share the Queen’s trust in the judgment of the British people. Rather than respect the decision, they have sought to overturn it.Given their lack of respect for the British people, it is perhaps not surprising to see their total lack of respect for our Monarch and our long political traditions. It is not the job of hard-Left politicians or Remainer MPs to decide what the Queen should or should not do.The only person from whom the Queen can take constitutionally binding advice is the Prime Minister. Should Boris Johnson lose a vote of no confidence then the Queen will be advised by her outgoing Prime Minister about who can or cannot command the confidence of the House of Commons.Further, as Prime Minister, it would be up to Mr Johnson to advise the Queen on whether to give Royal Assent to a Bill passed by the Commons and Lords blocking a No-Deal Brexit. It would be well within his rights to advise the Queen not to sign such a bill into law.Were Johnson to seek to remain after  days without calling an election, he would be breaking the law, and it would then be for the courts, not the Queen, to intervene.It is certainly possible in theory that the sovereign could be called upon to choose between two rival claims to form a government. However, this would be regarded as highly political and has not been done since .In reality, it is far more likely that the numbers in Parliament will tell us who does or does not have a majority, and that a general election will be called before getting the Queen involved.We all know what this is really about, though. The vote for Brexit was always destined to bring us to a constitutional crisis. It was the first moment in our country’s long and proud history when a majority of people outside of Parliament asked for something that a majority of people inside Parliament did not want to give.The right way through this mess is not to drag the Queen into politics but to deliver on the decision that was made by the British people more than three years ago.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It wasn’t. It was a vote to take back control.And as we look towards our departure, this Government must deliver an open immigration system that welcomes those who will  contribute to the economy and  le of our great country.With a say on who comes in — and who doesn’t — we’ll be able to ensure our public services are ready for a population increase and that the supply of houses goes up as quickly as it needs to.Don’t believe the doomsayers.

She’s since become a celebrity chef in her own right.I recall that Alex brought her sheepish husband along with her that morning for her first appearance on live TV.Perhaps it was for moral support, but I reckon it was more likely to keep an eye on him. He did his best impersonation of a penitent man and they somehow managed to reheat the souffle.Of course, it didn’t last.They split up in  and that same year, Hollywood began his relationship with ex- barmaid Summer.Alex was convinced the affair began before they finally split but this was vehemently denied by both Paul and Summer.Paul and Alex, of course, are now orced. And he apparently faces an imminent court battle over cash.Alex could even end up with half her ex-husband’s ­estimated £million fortune.She is currently enjoying a holiday in France, where she was photographed looking chic, cool and effortlessly ­elegant.No one could fail to forgive her for feeling a bit smug that her ex has been so publicly dumped. After all, she had to bear her share of public humiliation over his behaviour.Meanwhile, it gets worse and worse for Paul, as inevitably there is now talk of ­Summer writing a book and appearing in a clutch of reality shows.She didn’t sign the NDA so is completely free to warble about their sex le and all sorts of potentially embarrassing revelationsshe wishes.So it looks like Paul is leaving Summer behind him and entering the autumn and winter of his le alone, with only himself to blame.I’ve just gobbled up the entire new BBC series Fosse Verdon about the hugely talented husband and we team who, among many other hits, gave us musicals Sweet Charity, Cabaret and Chicago.It’s gratying to see Broadway legend Gwen Verdon finally given the acclaim she deserves for the part she played in Bob Fosse’s success.He was a genius choreographer and director but also a notorious womaniser, chain-smoker, heavy drinker and pill popper.This series never shies away from Fosse’s sleazy side, showing how manipulative he could be – and his seduction of vulnerable young actresses and dancers is not easy to watch.We are light years from the #MeToo movement, and this series illustrates why we need it so much.Sam Rockwell plays a blinder as Fosse, but Michelle Williams is a revelation as Gwen Verdon.It’s as though the red-headed dancing star has been brought back to le.You know those stock responses you get after stating the bleedin’ obvious – about the Pope being Catholic and bears defecating in the woods.There is another one which I always thought was very callous.“Does Rose Kennedy own a black dress ”This is particularly unfeeling given the many tragedies visited upon the Kennedy clan – continuing right up to the present day.Theirs is a long litany of pain and suffering.Matriarch Rose endured the death of her eldest son Joe during World War Two, before the unimaginable ordeal of seeing two more sons publicly gunned down.First when John, as US President, was assassinated in . Then his younger brother Bobby, the former Attorney General turned senator and presidential candidate, was brutally slain in .The “Kennedy curse” has persisted through the decades.Twenty years ago, John F Kennedy Jnr, JFK’s only son, died while flying his light aircraft to the Massachusetts island of Martha’s Vineyard when it crashed into the ocean.In , Mary Kennedy, the estranged we of Robert Kennedy Jr – Bobby’s son – was found dead in her New York home, having apparently taken her own le.And this week, the family gathered for yet another tragic occasion.This time it was the funeral of Bobby’s -year-old granddaughter Saoirse Kennedy Hill, who died from a suspected overdose at the family compound in Cape Cod.Rose died in  aged .She was spared witnessing the deaths of some of the younger members of the family, including poor Saoirse.But after all she endured during her long le, she deserves a bit more respect and understanding than being the punchline to a weak joke.Whoever signed up Michelle Visage for Strictly Come Dancing deserves a pay rise.Michelle, right, one of the stars of the fabulous RuPaul’s Drag Race, will be a firecracker of an addition to Strictly. She’s sassy, sexy, ballsy and a real grafter.She has a wonderful dirty laugh and a terric outlook and she’ll seize this show by the throat.I’d have paid real money to have seen her reduce sacked former pro Brendan Cole to a whimpering jellyfish.It’s a huge shame that’s no longer a possibility, but bosses need to make sure Michelle is paired with a young, hungry dancer not afraid to take risks.There could perhaps be a chance for Kevin Clton to win two Glitterballs in a row after his success with Stacey Dooley last year.Kevin and Michelle could really burn up that dance floor and there would be no hanky panky from this loyal woman whose -year marriage to hubby David is rock solid.So no Strictly “curse”, but knowing Michelle, maybe rather a lot of Strictly cursing.Her big-heartedness remains undimmed even under the cruel shadow of Alzheimer’s, so it was no surprise that Dame Barbara Windsor used her nd birthday this week to demand more action to help fellow sufferers and their families.While other entertainers with long careers might have used their special day just to celebrate their achievements, Dame Barbara instead pleaded for us all to show compassion towards those with dementia, and for the Government to ensure more resources are made available.Barbara and her devoted husband Scott Mitchell have become ambassadors for the Alzheimer’s Society charity and have sent an open letter to Boris Johnson to sort out the care crisis that is making le so very hard for everyone affected by this disease.Now Boris might profess to being unafraid of all of the EU grandees as he tries to deliver Brexit, but he should be quaking in his boots at the prospect of the wrath of our Barbarahe doesn’t deliver vital help and money to those affected by dementia.More power to this incredible woman and how lucky she is to have Scott to take care of her because, sadly, not everyone dealing with dementia has such a devoted partner.They have both made a huge dference in raising awareness and much-needed cash.When this horrible disease is finally vanquished, and one day it must be, we will never forget the part Barbara and Scott played. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And we should all rejoice in that.DAMNING new statistics reveal the average wait for a non-urgent GP appointment is now more than two weeks.This is simply not good enough.Boris Johnson promised in his first speech as Prime Minister that it was his job to make sure we don’t have to wait for weeks on end to see our doctor.The latest figures highlight the enormity of that task.There is a limit to what can be achieved by under-pressure health service staff and, though the PM has moved quickly to free up extra funding, there will never be an endless supply of money for the NHS, no matter who is in No.What is needed is serious reform and some radical thinking.Jeremy Corbyn will doubtless oppose any new ideas and continue using the NHS as a political football.Butthe Prime Minister can prove as single-minded on the health service as he is proving on Brexit, there is still hope.VAR made its Premier League debut on the opening weekend of the new season and had an instant impact.In spite of teething problems, it’s great to see the right decisions being reached by the video assistant referees — but fans should not be left in the dark while it happens.Refs should be mic’d up, like in rugby, so supporters can hear what’s going on.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Five years later, the terrorist – now held by western-backed Kurdish forces – claims he never bought into IS ideology, despite spending half a decade under the brutal regime. In an exclusive prison-cell interview with the Mirror, Parvez said he was stuck between “a wall and a hard place” and unable to leave. And the family he abandoned in West London, while admitting they will “always hate what he did”, have called for him to face justice in Britain. Parvez was stripped of his citizenship, but his parents Mohammed and Riaz want it restored so he can face court here.  They also want his we and young children, one of whom is disabled, to be brought up with their family in North West London. They are believed to be in a camp in northern Syria.Riaz, , has demanded a meeting with Home Secretary Sajid Javid to discuss his case. Weeping as she was shown photos of Parvez, who has lost more than four stone in prison, talking to the Daily Mirror in Syria, she said: “I can’t believe this is Hamzah.”A relative, who asked not to be named, insisted “he has to come back”, despite blaming the stress of Parvez joining IS for causing Mohammed, , to suffer a stroke and a brain haemorrhage. She said: “He was very selfish. People treat us like terrorists and we are good, normal people.

She insisted he should face justice in Britain, not Syria or the United States.

They live just km away from the frontier with the North while being surrounded by the Benaughlin Mountain in Co Fermanagh. Because of their location, the father and son duo now fear a no-deal Brexit will bring milk export taxes and border checks.Breffni told the Irish Mirror : You would [have fears] over a hard border – most definitely. Especially as I cross it five or six times a day.“I’ve heard stories about it before. [My dad] would be worried about it. What went on years ago it was torture for the people. “I don’t think it’ll come to that. I think they learnt enough years ago with the amount of people that were killed and injured. It couldn’t come down to that again.” Will a no-deal Brexit turn your le upside down  Email webnews@mirror  The dairy herd management graduate, who rents a number of fields across the border in the North, studied for two years at Ballyhaise Agricultural College before he started farming full-time. He added: “I’ve a lot of family across the border. My mother Jacinta’s from Fermanagh – only about five minutes down the road in Kinawley. “We’ve a lot of uncles and aunties down there and I’d cross the border five or six times a day maybe. “You’d hardly notice and you wouldn’t pass any dference. “My relatives would be concerned. The way the whole thing was going on and then it didn’t even happen in March and now it’s extended until October. “I think people are just fed up at this stage. Farmers obviously want some sort of a deal, but I think people are surprised by the situation.“I never thought it would happen at all and with Boris Johnson in now, I think things could change again.”Breffni believes former prime minister Theresa May was trying her best to secure a deal and says the backstop provided some degree of certainty for the border region and both jurisdictions.I think the deal we were getting for the North and the southern part of Ireland was meant to be the bees knees but nobody would back her.” The young farmer, whose older brother is Cavan footballer Gearoid McKiernan, is also very worried about the prospects of tax hikes on milk exports eating into their profits. He added: “Farming is a tough game. Tarfs would be the biggest [Brexit] worry, especially in the dairy industry. “Our dairy exports [in Ireland] are worth over €million and I think about €million of that is exported to the UK. “If there’s tarfs on all that, what way is it going to go ” Breffni explained how most of their income comes from dairy farming, with  cows on their farm. He said they buy a lot of their feed from cross-border business Lakelands, adding: “We make our own silage and we buy in the meal and fertiliser.

Sophie Carly Hope Smitherman was born at .pm on December , . Her parents Lyndsey and Sam Smitherman heard her cry twice before she was rushed out of the room and taken to intensive care where she lived for less than  hours. The first time Lyndsey was able to hold her little girl was after she had died. She said it felt like apossomeone had torn her heart in halfapos. Sophieaposs mum and dad had just watched doctors desperately perform CPR on their tiny daughter but eventually there was nothing more that could be done. She had struggled to breathe immediately after birth and her platelets had not formed properly meaning she had been bleeding. She had a total of  blood transfusions in the  hours she was alive, her mum said. Her siblings Jack-James, six, Annabelle-Violet, five, and Meadow, four, tragically never got to meet their baby sister.    Lyndsey turned  on Motheraposs Day this year, but she said it killed me inside. The mum-of-four told how results from an autopsy two months after Sophieaposs death on .pm on the December , , revealed she had died of Parvovirus B. Parvovirus B is a virus that commonly infects children and is not routinely tested for during pregnancy. Lyndsey claims she was told by doctors thatshe had been tested for it during pregnancy, her baby could have been saved with a blood transfusion while still in the womb. The mum is now bravely sharing her story to raise awareness of the virus, in the hope that other pregnant women will become aware of it and consider requesting a test. Lyndsey says she does not want anyone  to suffer like they have had to.    Speaking to Mirror, Lyndsey, from Kent, described the heartbreaking moment her baby girl passed away as doctors performed CPR. She said: We kept on saying aposyou can make it, you can do it Sophie.apos I sort of zoned out and felt like it was not me in the room. They said aposwe are doing everything we can for herapos and carried on for a while longer. But then they came over and said aposwe have got to stopapos. It was like someone tore my heart in half and I wanted to collapse to the floor because I was in so much pain.  But I couldnapost collapse to the floor because no one would have been able to pick me up because of the pain. As soon as she passed away they said we could hold her. Within seconds I had her in my arms and it was the first time I held her. It was amazing to be able to feel her but hard knowing that she was not actually there.    The school supervisor added: The Parvovirus B had got to her so much it was shutting everything down. The virus was in her heart, so the whole body went into shut down. I wish I had been tested for it because then I would still have her here. Lyndsey and husband Sam, , found out in May last year they were expecting another baby. The mum said it was just like any of her other pregnancies, she was sailing through it, going to her scans, and everything seemed fine. But on Sunday December  when Lyndsey went to bed things werenapost quite right. There was not a lot of movement, she described. All my girls, when Iaposve been pregnant, have kicked me to pieces. Sophie would come up between me and Sam when he used to lie on my belly, but that evening she didnapost do it.  When Lyndsey woke up the following morning she said things had not got any better as she tried to get her moving. She phoned the hospital and explained how she felt reduced movement and was advised to go in to be checked out and monitored. At that point she was nearing the  week mark. When she went into hospital for tests, Lyndsey said medics told her aposwe need to get her out as soon asapos. Theyaposd picked up her heart rate was not great and it was like she was sleepy inside, Lyndsey said. They broke my waters to try and get everything started and my contractions began pretty quickly. But doctors could see she was not getting her breath back quickly enough so they suggested an emergency c-section. We wanted to be safe so we went for it. Lyndsey said doctors were reassuring about the cesarean and she and Sam felt quite relaxed as the procedure for Jack-Jamesapos birth had been OK. Sophie was born at .pm on December , , but she was immediately whisked away by medical staff. As soon as she was born, we heard her cry twice and then she was taken away from us to help her to breathe, Lyndsey told. Just as they said to Sam aposdo you want to come over and see her,apos they rushed her out of the room and said she needed to get a bit of help. We didnapost get told anything until we went into the recovery room.  Lyndsey said as it approached midnight a doctor came to show them a picture of their daughter and explained she was in intensive care having trouble with her lungs and was jaundiced. Other people were coming in the room with their babies, but I didnapost have my baby Lyndsey said, explaining she and Sam still hadnapost met their precious daughter properly in person. In the picture she had looked perfect, she was still our daughter. But it was heartbreaking not being able to see her. It was about .am on December  by the time they were allowed to see her. Before they took her, they brought her to us but it was only for five minutes, then they rushed her out, Lyndsey said. I wanted it to last longer, she said, but her baby needed a blood transfusion. We didnapost even get to touch her as she was in an incubator. The parents were warned Sophie was not forming her platelets which was causing her to bleed. We were told sheaposd need to be transferred to another hospital but I couldnapost go with her and had to wait until .am until the ambulance took me, Lyndsey said. Sam had to drive as they wouldnapost let him in the ambulance. When they got to the second hospital, little Sophie was having further scans. It was .am when they got to see her again. She was in her little incubator and had wires coming out everywhere, Lyndsey said. She had lots of dferent machines around her and a blue light on her for jaundice. Her skin was really shiny and she was very bloated because she was being pumped with dferent things. She couldnapost breath, she was having blood transfusions every hour. I loved the fact I was able to be there with her, but at the same time I was thinking aposshe has so much going onapos.  Lyndsey still tried so stay positive, and believed her daughter would be fine and that she was in the best place. I just wanted to spend all the time with her, she told. They allowed us to sit there and touch her. We were able to stick our hand through the holeand touch her hand. But after a little while of holding her, her stats dropped and we had to move. We werenapost allowed to touch our own daughter. Doctors were constantly at her side. At around .pm, Sophie had a terrying setback as she suffered a cardiac arrest. The parents were not present at the time and were told by doctors what had happened after they had aposbrought her backapos. They warned that aposthings werenapost brilliantapos. I was shocked and thought aposwhatanything had happened to her,apos Lyndsey told. But after they said they brought her back I felt positive she would be OK and she would pull through. I thoughtsheaposd got through that, she will get through this, little fighter.  Lyndseyaposs parents had brought the other kids to the hospital after school, but they were not allowed to see their new sister as she was too ill. Late that night, Lyndsey and Sam were askedthey had thought about christening their daughter. Sam asked, aposdoes that mean she is not going to pull through,apos but they wouldnapost answer that question, Lyndsey said. I kept thinking aposshe is my little girl, she will make it throughapos. Sophie was christened at am on December  with a priest coming into the hospital for the ceremony. By .am they were taken aside by a doctor who explained aposthings werenapost looking greatapos. He said only half of her heart was doing the work, Lyndsey said. He said aposshe may not make itapos andshe did things wouldnapost be brilliant for her. That made us feel really sick. We asked my parents to get the kids out of school early so they could come and see her before anything happened. The kids didnapost get to meet her at all. At . Lyndsey and Sam were back in ICU with their daughter but had to witness doctors performing CPR on her, at barely two days old. It was hard, very hard, it made me feel really, really low, Lyndsey said. She added: My parents had just arrived with the other kids, they were waiting outside the door when she passed away. Sam was there with me the whole time, he never left my side. All we left the hospital with was a memory box with a few things of hers - her little hat that held the tubes in place, little sunglasses to cover her eyes from the blue light. Lyndsey said two months later, following an autopsy, they found out their daughter had died of Parvovirus B, also known as aposslapped cheekapos. The NHS says:Parvovirus B is a virus that commonly infects children. It is usually transmitted by coughing and sneezing and hand washing is important in helping to prevent spread. For most healthy people, Parvovirus B causes a mild, self-limiting illness which is followed by le-long immunity. Pregnant women are not routinely screened for past Parvovirus B infection as there is no vaccine or preventative treatment available. The exact number of Parvovirus B infections in the UK is not known as the virus does not always show symptoms, and the diagnosis can only be confirmed by blood test. In women who are not immune, infection in the first  weeks of pregnancy can lead to serious problems for your baby before it is born.This would usually happen three to five weeks after the onset of maternal infection, but can be later. The greatest period of risk to the baby is between four to  weeks. Infection during this time can sometimes lead to serious complications such as fetal anaemia and sometimes fetal loss .There is a five – ten per cent risk of fetal losswomen develop this infection in the second trimester. Infection in the first month of pregnancy is not thought to carry any risk. Most babies will not be infected or affected by the virus. For more information, click here.

Whereas Kate Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge, and Prince William are more reserved and are rarely seen wrapping their arms around each other.

Sophie Sutton, , was admitted to University Hospital Aintree in Liverpool on May  last year after taking an overdose, but says she was told to go home by medics despite her warnings that she wanted to jump.The former Liverpool John Moores University Student was left in agonising pain and needing surgery after shattering both her legs in the leap from the top of the multi-storey car park.She has been diagnosed with Emotional Unstable Personality Disorder and depression.    Sophie, from West Derby, told the Liverpool Echo that she had been struggling with low-mood, anxiety and suicidal thoughts. She said the jump was a genuine attempt to end her le but she did not feel that the mental health team took her seriously, despite a previous attempt to jump from the same car park. My heart was racing and I felt determined. I was scared at the same time. As I let go I felt instant regret and wanted to go back, but obviously couldnapost, she said. Sophie said she was taken to Aintree Hospital on May  by a relative after taking an overdose, and was checked over before being seen by the mental health team just after midnight.She said: There were two members of the crisis team I saw.We went to a room in AE majors and they asked me why I took the overdose, but at the time I was fixated on what I was doing to do [jump] but I was scared at the same time, so I told them I wanted to jump. They didnapost know how to respond. I donapost think they believed my intentions were real.   After I said I couldnapost get home and had no money, one member said apossound, you can go, find something to do for a few hours or you can walk homeapos so I felt judged and not taken seriously.Then I picked myself up and ran out. Sophieaposs case was one of a series of troubling incidents identied in a review into problems at Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the cityaposs mental health services.The thematic review action plan said some mental health practitioners at the trust, particularly those in hospital settings, were working with gaps in their knowledge.The report mentioned another woman who had thrown herself from the building after being admitted following an overdose. Since itaposs publication, a man in his s fell from the second floor after being sectioned.Sophie, who hopes to work as a mental health nurse, said she would have been seen as high risk after a similar suicide attempt around three months before the fall, when she took an overdose while an inpatient at Clock View Hospital in Walton. She was also taken to Aintree on that occasion and managed to make her way to the top floor of the car park building, but was stopped from jumping by police officers.Despite the warning signs, Sophie said she felt as though the crisis team did not take her intentions seriously, which only strengthened her intention to jump.She said: It was adrenaline at first but then I just got this huge, horrible pain in both legs, and I couldnapost feel my feet. I went back to Aintree in an ambulance and they gave me gas and air and ketamine. Sophie says the tibia and fibula in both legs were broken, and to make matters worse she developed a pulmonary embolism - a blood clot which travelled to her lung.She had surgery to replace metal rods in her legs and remained in hospital for two weeks, before spending another two weeks in a rehabilitation centre."},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather forecast five more","story":"NewsUK weather forecast: Five more days of rain misery in wettest ever AugustThe stormy weather that has blasted Britain in recent days looks set to continue with downpours forecast for at least the rest of this weekShareCommentsByToby Meyjes:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video weather-forecast-rainy-misery-continue-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email August could be the wettest on record with at least five more days of downpours predicted this week alone.

Di Pogson, , decided to get back into dating after losing her husband, Ian, of nearly  years suddenly in July . After years of grieving, Di decided to join a dating site in late , where she was swept off her feet by a jet-setting businessman called Kevin Thompson. He purported to be a fellow widower in his fties based in London - and Di felt an instant connection with him. Believing he understood the pain of losing a cherished partner, as they exchanged messages and spoke on the phone, they grew closer until Di, of Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, genuinely believed she had found love. But, once he had gained her trust, ‘Kevin’ began to ask her for money, fabricating all sorts of reasons from having a vetaposs bill to pay to being stuck abroad with an unusable debit card to wheedle cash from her. Convinced he was genuine and would repay her, Di agreed – until his web of lies began to unravel with alarming consequences.    The police became involved - discovering that Kevin Thompson was a  profile, set up by a gang consisting of ringleaders Yaw Sarpong, , Nicholas Adade,  and Eric Ocansey, , and more peripheral members Obed Addo, , and Daniel Keh, . Speaking out after the con artists were convicted for their crimes at Guildford Crown Court, Di now wants to raise awareness of dating scams to protect other vulnerable people from falling foul of them. She said: “For a long time, I felt so stupid. I’m a grown woman – how on earth had I been conned like this  People may read this and think it would never happen to them, but until youaposve been in this situation, you donapost know. “But aposKevinapos truly led me to believe that he loved me, that we’d be together. I was in a vulnerable state then, having lost Ian, and I wanted and needed to be loved. “Whenever I did start asking questions, he would turn it round on me and make me feel guilty. It was incredibly manipulative. “I can’t go back and undo anything though, and I refuse to let this eat me up, or they win all over again. Now, I just want to help other people and to warn them to be wary online.” Di, who is retired, was approaching her th wedding anniversary when Ian suddenly became unwell, developing dficulty walking. He was taken to hospital and given a CT scan, which initially appeared fine – only for him to rapidly decline just hours later.    She recalled: “He had the scan, and I saw him that evening. I left the hospital at about pm on July  and he seemed relatively fine. “Then, my phone rang when I was back home at about pm. It was someone from the hospital telling me to come back. “By the time I got there, Ian was dead. He’d died of an undetected embolism, which is when the arteries get blocked by something like a blood clot or air bubble. “It was horrendous. The scan being fine had almost lulled me into a  sense of security.” In October , Di began to think about companionship and how much she missed it. She added: “It wasn’t necessarily about relationships. I just wanted a friend – someone to go for meals or to the cinema with.” So, she joined an online dating site and, before long, she came across the profile of Kevin Thompson, who presented himself as a well-to-do businessman. “He wasn’t what I’d call drop dead gorgeous, but he seemed like a nice, normal guy,” she said. “He told me he had a daughter, and that he had also been widowed when his we died very suddenly. “I felt comfortable opening up to him and telling him about Ian, and the memories we had.    “He would tell me about all the places he’d been with his we, and say he wanted to take me too. He sent me all these photos of him on holiday, and I even spoke to him on the phone. “He was well-spoken and sounded completely normal – there was nothing to ring any alarm bells.” After a couple of weeks of talking, Di received a message from Kevin, claiming to have an emergency with his pet dog. She explained: “He said he was stuck abroad and that his card wouldn’t work, but that he needed £ for an emergency vetaposs bill, as his dog was very sick. “I’m an animal lover myself, and he made me feel so guilty. In the back of my mind, I thought, ‘Would a vet really demand money up front like that ’ “But he was so convincing, and every question I had, he came up with a plausible answer.” Convinced she was helping save the le of an innocent animal, Di transferred the cash. And, before long, more requests came through, with Kevin telling ious hoods, each time guilt tripping her into helping. His sob stories included everything from being overseas on a business trip with a blocked card, to having to pay government taxes related to his business so he could fly back to the UK.    “Each time, the amount was around £,, said Di. Before I ever spoke to Kevin, I’d had a couple of spam messages from people asking for money, and each time, I saw them coming a mile off. “If only Iaposd been as astute this time, as I do look back and feel stupid that I fell for his con. “He always had an answer, though, and he would play a lot on my guilt and self-doubt. If I questioned too much, I’d get, ‘Why don’t you trust me ’ or ‘You can’t possibly love meyou aren’t helping.’ “He made promise after promise to pay me back, too, and the way he had presented himself, he seemed like he would be able to. By the end, it felt like I had to keep giving over moneyI ever wanted to see a penny of it back – almost like I had to keep him on side until we met in person. Also, the picture Kevin painted of his glamorous le made it seem asa few thousand pounds meant nothing to him - which Di found made it even harder to say no. “He’d talk about his flash lestyle, how he had a Ferrari and spent summers in Italy. He told me it was degrading that he even had to ask for money, she said. “He even said he had written me a cheque for £,, which is more than I lent him, to thank me.” As Di fell deeper and deeper under Kevin’s manipulative spell, he also convinced her that he was in love with her, to the point where she genuinely believed they were in a trusting relationship.    She added: “He led me to believe we’d be together and have this idyllic le. We’d talk on the phone and he’d say he loved hearing my voice, and would ask when my birthday was, so he could send a present. “He even sent me flowers – some red roses – and would tell me he was going to get me a diamond ring. “He said he loved me, and I said it back. Now, I don’t think I did, but at the time, I genuinely believed I could.” But the illusion of romance and grandeur Kevin had created was swtly shattered in December , when Di came down to London, believing she was going to finally meet him in person. In the weeks prior to this, nagging doubts had been mounting in her mind, but the idea of finally seeing him in the flesh – and the promise he would have a cheque for her – alleviated her suspicions. The plan had been for him to meet her at her hotel near Marble Arch in the centre of the city – but he never came. She recalled: “He seemed really excited to meet me. He’d apparently been to China on business, and was flying in that day. He even asked me to meet him at the airport, so we’d have longer together. “In the end, we agreed to meet at my hotel. I sat in the foyer, waiting and waiting, but he never came. “It was horrendous, I felt like such an idiot. Eventually, I lost my temper and left an angry voicemail. “I didn’t hear back until the next morning. He said he’d been on a delayed flight then fallen asleep at home, but had to go straight back to China as something had gone wrong. “He even turned the voicemail back on me, calling me heartless and saying he couldn’t believe I would speak to him like that.” Di then askedshe could at least meet him to get the cheque he had promised – but yet again, he had an answer, claiming he was already back at the airport and didn’t have it with him to post.    She did have his address, but he told her she wouldn’t be able to get into the property to retrieve her money. By that point, there was no doubt in her mind that something was wrong. What’s more, she was in financial dire straits, having given him a staggering £, – most of which came from a loan she had taken out, on his advice, to help ease her debts. “Kevin knew about the loan – he was the one who suggested it, as I’d been struggling with maxed out credit cards and being overdrawn,” she said. “He said it would be a way to clear all of that and keep myself afloat. But he took every penny.” Shortly after their doomed meeting, Kevin tried one more time to get money out of Di, telling her that once again he was stuck abroad, and would not be able to get home for Christmas. She continued: “He said his daughter would be alone, and that I was abandoning him to spend Christmas by himself. “By then, I knew something was wrong anyway – but there was also no money left to give. I couldn’t have helped himI’d wanted to.” Shockingly, as soon as Di told Kevin she didnapost have a penny to give him, he disappeared, never to message her again. But she was not prepared to let him get away with what he had done and reported him to police. Officers then spent years tirelessly building their case, combing through messages, and eventually unmasking the gang behind the fake profile.    It emerged there was also another victim, who had been conned out of £,. “One of the hardest parts was admitting to myself just how much they had taken,” said Di. “Going through the messages brought it all back – I felt so stupid. “Now, I can see that they were written by dferent people. You can tell by spelling mistakes. But at the time, I was convinced I had found love.” During their investigations, police also found that the address Kevin had given to Di was , registered to a complete stranger. Finally, in July , the gang appeared at Guildford Crown Court to answer for their crimes. There, a jury found Yaw Sarpong, of Hampshire, guilty of conspiracy to commit fraud by  representation, and he was jailed for  months. His associates Nicholas Adade Adu, of Stoke on Trent, Staffs., and Eric Ocansey, of Birmingham, pleaded guilty to the same charge. Adu was jailed for three years and seven months, while Ocansey was jailed for two years – both also receiving  months for money laundering, to run concurrently. Obed Addo, from Roehampton, was jailed for  months for money laundering, while Daniel Keh, of Enfield, north west London, was jailed for  months for converting criminal property and supplying articles to be used in fraud, plus six months for money laundering to run concurrently. Now, Di is looking ahead to rebuilding her le, and is happily in a new relationship after meeting her current partner, who she does not wish to name, online  months ago. She said: “I was wary to get back online, but I now know thatsomebody is making excuses and putting off meeting you in person, it’s not right. Either they are messing you around – or something more.

Even US president Donald Trump shared one on his Twitter account without evidence. Paedophile billionaire Epstein, , who was awaiting trial for sex-trafficking charges, had been put on suicide watch two weeks ago when he was found with neck injuries. But officials took him off the watch list six days later, at the end of July. Rudy Giuliani, former Mayor for New York City, was also amongst those to tweet out questions following the incident on Saturday morning.    He wrote on Twitter: What does the word watch mean in the phrase suicide watch  Who was watching  What does camera show  Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore questioned the credibility of the officials reports as he said on Twitter: I guess they think a country dumb enough to elect Trump is stupid enough to believe Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide. Or not. Malignant narcissist like Epstein - the last thing they do is get rid of the thing they LOVE the most: themselves. Amongst the unfounded rumours to appear online were tweets linking Epsteinaposs death to former president Bill Clinton and his we Hillary. Donald Trump retweeted a video promoting a conspiracy theory that connects to the Clintons just hours after Epstein was found hanged. Terrence K Williams, a conservative commentator and comedian, had made completely unfounded allegations in a video posted to his Twitter.  He wrote in the video caption: Died of SUICIDE on   SUICIDE WATCH  Yeah right!

New York Cityaposs Chief Medical Examiner said the determination is still pending the day after the paedophile billionaire was found in his cell. It comes as the New York Post claimed a source said there was no surveillance footage of the moment the former financier died. According to the paper, cameras are focused on the areas outside cells at the politan Correctional Center but not inside. Chief Medical Examiner Barbara Sampson said in a statement: The Medical Examineraposs determination is pending further information at this time.    At the request of those representing the decedent, and with the awareness of the federal prosecutor, I allowed a private pathologistto observe the autopsy examination. This is routine practice. It was revealed previously how Epstein had been placed on suicide watch after he was found with injuries to his neck on July . However, he had recently been taken off in a decision that has reportedly baffled former wardens. A source told Reuters that two jail guards are required to make separate checks on all prisoners every  minutes.  However, that procedure was not followed in the hours before Epstein was found in his cell. A prison official told the New York Times one of the guards was working for his fth straight day of overtime, while the second corrections officer had been forced to work overtime as well. Other sources old the Daily Mail that Epstein had told prison guards and fellow inmates that he believed someone had tried to kill him. The insider also claimed he seemed to be in good spirits.    There was no indication that he might try to take his own le, the source said. From what I saw, he was finally starting to adjust to prison. I think he was comforted by the rigidity of his new le. For years Epstein, who never married and had no children, had been accused of sexually abusing girls and young women. Following his arrest on July , he had pleaded not guilty to charges of sex trafficking involving dozens of underage girls as young as , from at least  to . He was accused of recruiting underage women to engage in sex acts with him, sometimes over a period of years while paying the women for each encounter.

But mopping, sweeping and dusting can all have a negative effect on our health. And, in some cases, cleaning can even make us ill. We spoke to cleaning expert Ralitsa Prodanova from home cleaning firm Fantastic Services about the top  mistakes you could be making around your home and the best way to keep your pad spick and span. Scrubbing black mould Nobody wants their house to get mouldy, but scrubbing spores can be extremely hazardous. Ralitsa says: “Black mould, caused by damp, is unsightly and itaposs tempting to try and scrub it away. But doing so could cause respiratory problems – and even hallucinations. “Black mould that grows on damp walls can often be highly toxic. These living, organic moulds can send spores into the air – which spread like a virus.”    The most common type of mould can cause respiratory problems, skin inflammation, tiredness and nausea. Whereas moulds such as “rye ergot” can even cause hallucinations. To get rid of mould safely, Ralitsa, advises: “Always wear a protective mask, rubber gloves and safety glasses. “The most effective way of combatting mould is to pour bleach into a spraying bottle, before covering mouldy areas and letting the bleach get to work for  minutes. Open all windows to allow any toxic fumes to escape and wipe and rinse the area.” Skipping the gym From dumbbells to yoga mats, many people have some form of fitness equipment lying around at home. But how often do they get thoroughly scrubbed  Ralitsa, says: “There have been lots of studies into the bugs that lurk on workout equipment. And, often, gym equipment carries more germs than toilets – including those which can cause boils, eczma, acne and rosacea – aw well as the dreaded superbug, MRSA. “Gym equipment might get missing in your cleaning routine but it needs to be wiped and disinfected regularly.” Chemical reactions When youaposre using multiple cleaning products you need to be careful not to mix them.    Ralitsa, says: “Household cleaning chemicals are often hazardous. But they become even more dangerous when mixed. “The key thing to watch out for is mixing bleach with other substances. Bleach and any ammonia-based cleaners is a no-no, as it can potentially create a toxic gas that could even prove deadly in some circumstances. Meanwhile, bleach and vinegar can also release a gas that can attack your airways.” Making your bed Forget everything your mother told you, as making your bed can actually be bad for your health. Ralista, explains: “You should actually stop making your bed in the morning, as soon as you wake up. Instead, you should throw the duvet off the bed and let your mattress breathe. “Dust mites love warmth and humidity, which is why they love your bed.   “The problem is that their microscopic faeces can trigger reactions, including asthma and eczema , as well as sneezing, a runny nose, red eyes, itching, tightness in the chest and shortness of breath.“Butyou leave your bed unmade every morning – exposing your bed to cold air – the miles will simply dehydrate and die. “Then itaposs just a case of washing bedding weekly in hot temperatures while frequently dusting and vacuuming, too.” Not cleaning the vacuum Most of us only empty our hoovers when they are full. But it needs to be done on a regular basis. Ralitsa explains: “The brushes and the insides of vacuums essentially act as a mobile germ factory.  “Bacteria and germs are festering and breeding on the inside, multiplying rapidly. And, there has been research to suggest that  per cent of all vacuum cleaners actually harbour the bug, E. coli. “Iaposd advise homeowners to empty their vacuum on a much more regular basis and to give it a good wipe and disinfection after every use, too.” Forgetting to seal the deal Itaposs incredibly close to all our food – but the fridge seal is often overlooked in the cleaning process. Ralitsa says: “Fridge door seals typically have lots of folds and crevices, where it pushes against the sides of the unit in order to form a tight seal. But these crevices are food residue traps and bugs can sit there, undetected, for years. “It can also trap mould, which gets released every time you close and open the door and which can lead to allergies.”    Not throwing the towel in Tea towels often get used multiple times before theyaposre tossed into the washing machine. But you should actually be changing them every single day. Ralitsa says: “Tea towels are often moist and warm from previous use – allowing for bacteria to multiply rapidly. “Iaposd recommend you either replace them every day with clean, dry ones. Or wash them at the end of each day, so they are ready for use again the next morning.” And Ralitsa suggests performing the same routine for our oven gloves too. Putting the lid down Your bathroom might be sparkling after a good clean, but youaposll instantly undo all your hard workyou leave the lid of your toilet up when you flush. “Every time you flush your toilet, poo particles are flung into the air,” says Ralitsa. “These bio-aerosols can be extremely harmful – and the airborne water droplets are often contaminated with viruses and bacteria.” "},{"url":null,"title":"men can now buy clear","story":"NewsMen can now buy clear plastic shorts - and theyre bound to make people blushClear plastic beach shorts for men now exist and unsurprisingly they leave very little to the imaginationShareCommentsByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsThey leave very little to the imagination \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailPlanning your next holiday and want to make a strong impression when you hit the beach Well fellas, we have just the thing for youyou want something a little dferent from your usual swimming trunks.Four words: Transparent waterproof beach shorts.

We know that as a team.“But you ask for a reaction and you ask for character – that was there in abundance in the second half.“I thought the two boys, McDaid and Todd, coming on did really well and we looked more of a threat.“Looking back at the game now it was a game of two halves — a cliche I know — but it probably ended up a fair result.“Near the end I thought we might nick it, too.“Both McDaid and Todd have been in the mix. I like both of them, and Jamie Ness is back in the mix now, too.“It’s healthy we have him back and healthy we have those two pushing for places. That adds to the squad.”So, what are the possibilities for the Dens gaffer against Ian McCall’s Honest Men Despite an error for the second goal at Dunfermline, Jack Hamilton is the undisputed No  goalie at the club and will almost certainly retain his spot ahead of second-choice Calum Ferrie.After seeing the three-man backline perform well in a commanding performance against Inverness in the Betfred Cup the match previous, it’s clear the same line-up didn’t work at Dunfermline.Every game is dferent but should McPake switch to a back four, that’ll obviously see one centre-half drop out.The knock picked up by skipper Josh Meekings and his injury history make him favourite to miss out.Andrew Davies is nowhere near match fitness so that leaves Jordon Forster and Jordan McGhee as central defenders for this one.At full-back, Jordan Marshall did OK and will likely continue, as will Cammy Kerr on the right, though he didn’t have his best night at East End Park.A shake-up in defence would bring another midfielder into play and with McDaid, Todd and Ness all banging on the door for a starting spot, McPake has decisions to make. Young Finn Robertson has been excellent so far this campaign but his youthfulness may see him replaced by the more experienced Ness for this one.Paul McGowan and Shaun Byrne are key players but,Dundee go to a -- that’s likely to see one miss out – or McGowan moved further upfield.On the wings, McDaid and Todd may have done enough to earn their starting spurs.Danny Johnson’s three goals in two matches make him almost certain to start. Less certain is Andrew Nelson’s place after he was replaced at half-time on Friday, however.Injury and illness have hampered Craig Curran lately, though he is expected to be fit for Saturday.McGowan in behind Johnson could be McPake’s pick for this big early-season clash."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/08/5d4da88d079375.82057049.jpg ","title":"dundee united coaches getting together to raise bumper kiltwalk funds","story":"Dundee United are kicking off a Kiltwalk project to fund some festive cheer this year.A band of community trust coaches plus friends are teaming up for this year’s marathon walk with the aim of raising a bumper bundle to help pay for their Christmas Day event at Tannadice.Michael Malone, United’s community trust education project manager, said: “We should have about  people in total taking part in the Kiltwalk this year.

defeat in Croatia, the Reds were looking to get back to winning ways, but Ilkay Durmus# early goal in Paisley denied them.Derek McInnes’ team never really got their attack going and were found to be vulnerable on the break in damp conditions.The rampant optimism of a week ago, after they’d beaten Georgians Chikhura Sachkhere and then Hearts at Pittodrie, has been dimmed, and they’ll need to improve across the board to have any chance of overturning the Croatian Cup winners’ - first leg lead and keep their hopes of the Euro group stage alive.McInnes made four changes from the team which lost - to Rijeka.Shay Logan, who handed Rijeka a penalty by pulling back Luka Capan, was dropped for new Bristol City loanee Zak Vyner, who made his first appearance.With one eye on Thursday’s , McInnes freshened up the attack with Scott Wright, Connor McLennan and league debutant Curtis Main in for Jon Gallagher, Niall McGinn and Sam Cosgrove – although there were questions marks as to whether Cosgrove’s absence was due to muscle tightness.St Mirren had the first chance to threaten on  minutes from a free-kick after Greg Leigh  bundled Paul McGinn to the deck on the right of the box.Durmus’ initial left-footed effort hit Funso Ojo in the wall, before Tony Andreu’s tame effort from  yards was caught easily by Joe Lewis.However, the home side opened the scoring on  minutes.Greg Leigh got caught out of position after a poor clearing header, with McGinn setting Kyle Magennis free down the right.He squared to the Durmus, who broke into the area and finished into the bottom right corner.It could’ve been two on  minutes. Calum Waters cross from the left headed over by Durmus.Main blazed a shot over from outside the area with  minutes played, having shrugged Gary Mackenzie off in the visitors’ first effort.The Dons interchanging midfield four of Wright, Ryan Hedges, Lewis Ferguson and McLennan wasn’t quite clicking for all their energy, with the man in possession being crowded out.Up the other end, big striker Jon Obika looked a real handful, with his pace, strength and aggression occupying Andy Considine and Scott McKenna.However, Hedges did find space to fire into Vaclav Hladky’s hands from  yards on  minutes, before Ferguson shot miles wide with a free-kick from  yards.Despite building a bit of pressure towards the end of the period, no more real chances materialised.Conversely, an  Andreu free-kick and Durmus overhead kick could’ve extended Saints’ lead, but were both caught by Lewis.Soon after play restarted, Main turned well with the ball and almost found the top left corner from range.On  minutes, Vyner got forward and delivered a pinpoint cross on to Ferguson’s head, and Hladky tipped over the bar.Three minutes later, the keeper threw himself on a deflected McLennan strike. However, he appeared to lt his hands from the ball, which Main stole and rolled into the net.Referee Steven McLean didn’t allow the equaliser – which would’ve been contentious – to stand.But it was a decent spell for Aberdeen, with Hladky punching a whipped Hedges free-kick clear soon after, before Sean McLoughlin looked to handle another of the attacker’s deliveries into the middle.Vyner was booked for protesting too vocerously for a penalty.Gaffer McInnes sent the rested Niall McGinn and Jon Gallagher on for McLennan and Wright in an attempt to force the issues for the Reds.But, on  minutes, St Mirren could’ve scored again, but Andreu somehow flicked Paul McGinn’s cross past the post.Ryan Flynn then went close with  minutes to go, ghosting inside, but shooting straight at Considine as he tried to find the inside of the front post.Kyle McAllister was next to try for the home side, and his long-range effort narrowly missed the top left corner.James Wilson was sent on for the Dons as they threw everything at the quick-countering Buddies to try and level it.The big chance of a frantic finish fell to substitute McGinn, from Considine’s cross, but he struck the outside of the post on the angle at the death."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/5425c719-dc3c-4048-b4d0-9cde82ef58e9-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/5425c719-dc3c-4048-b4d0-9cde82ef58e9-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/5425c719-dc3c-4048-b4d0-9cde82ef58e9-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/08/5425c719-dc3c-4048-b4d0-9cde82ef58e9-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"aberdeen man climbs 50 munros in 150 days to raise cash charlie house","story":"An Aberdeen man who challenged himself to climb  Munros in only  days has completed his goal.Bruce Russell, director at recruitment business Right People, is a keen hillwalker and often tackles around  to  Munros a year.Alongside his we Clare for many of the treks, he took on the gruelling task – raising more than £, for children’s charity Charlie House in the process.Charlie House supports children and young people with complex disabilities and or le-limiting conditions.He also often took along its mascot Charlie Dog for the journey.Bruce said: “This was a much bigger challenge than I expected but the thought of those who would benefit kept me going.“It’s such a worthwhile cause, I’m delighted I could contribute.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column june 28 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat is it with recruiting #professionals# to Argyll We seem to be a distinctly unattractive prospect, as witnessed by the problems with recruiting a dentist in Lochgilphead.What people fail to appreciate is that they stand to gain so much more than they would lose by coming to Argyll.The scenery is unrivalled the pace of le is civilised we are not that far from the central belt and a sense of community remains.Just turn to our front page story for proof.Disappointment at losing out on council grant funding has turned into joy in Tarbert.But only because the people of the village have such big hearts, as they have demonstrated in the past.The council may argue that this vindicates its decision to refuse funding.

Day one saw us head out from Carloway aboard the SYSAC II under the watchful eye of skippper Robbie Bell who knows these waters like the back of his hand.The day kicked off with a bait hunt in the East Loch but the mackerel were pretty scarce, it took an hour or so to fill the baskets before steaming out to the two-mile mark in search of spurdogs. By then there was a fair wee wind picking up and it was a tad rough to say the least, with the heavy swell claiming a few breakfasts along the way.All that was soon forgotten as the battle commenced with the mighty spurs. The action started on the first drop with some thumpers coming aboard, single and double shots causing mayhem thrashing about the deck and we lost count of the number of rigs sliced through on the way up. But that’s what we came for, not everyone’s choice but great sport all the same.In between the madness we picked away at the haddock, whiting, grey and red gurnard, ling and pollack, until we had our quota and decided to seek the smoother waters of East Loch Roag for some flattie bashing on the soft ground. It was good to get into the calm and fish the light gear, picking away for dabs and plaice. There was plenty around, nothing huge but a steady flow coming aboard taking us to the end of the day with a good mixed bag of species.Day two set off in brilliant sunshine and not a breath of wind, it was almost tropical conditions. We quickly got our supply of fresh bait in West Loch Roag and set off for the rough ground in search of a few more species, but there was little or no drt so we took a turn into Clf Bay and settled in for a day on the rays. It was brilliant fun, everyone got their fair share with loads of thornback rays and a few spotted rays coming aboard, plenty of dabs, plaice, dogfish and a bonus lb oz turbot to add to the tally. It was a great opportunity to brush up on some of fishing techniques that don’t get practised much at home.We decided to hit the hard ground on the way back to the harbour. It was quite slow, maybe a wee bit early yet, but it produced more haddock, a lovely lb cuckoo wrasse and pollack bringing our two day adventure to an end. All in all another excellent club trip.This year we picked up  species,  counting fish and a few personal bests. Add to that, great company, loads of banter, a good skipper who makes a mean cup o’ tea and you have the ideal ingredients for another memorable few days away on Lewis. We’ll be back next year for sure.Results: Nikki Thompson  points, Robert MacBrayne , Nick Friel , Jim Smith , Gary Sinclair , Steven MacBrayne ."},{"url":null,"title":"mach1 scottish tarmack rally championship report","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWith  starters and  Cobble shop STRC registered the championship tables were always going to change on this mid-season two day event.Sunshine was forecast for the Machrihanish Airbase Community Companycourse and that’s what was delivered. Some crews were hoping for rain but this year it wasn’t to be. Last year’s winner Bruce Edwards in the Darrian T GTR was favourite and since Bruce had not driven the car competitively since Mach   we all thought he would be a bit rusty.Bruce led from the start and set some impressive times throughout the two days but on the last stage he threw it all away and rolled the car as he clipped a large lorry tyre a mile from the finish line, unable to right the car and with the stage blocked the clerk of the course decided on the grounds of safety to cancel the final stage. This allowed Alistair Inglis in the lotus Exige and a previous Mach  winner to clinch the top spot.Class  had  STRC registered this year and new to class  was Tom Blackwood in the gorgeous yellow and Black Fiesta R+. Tom#s first event driving in anger and showed that with some tweaks here and there with suspension settings it’s a great car to drive. How well the car drives notwithstanding, there was a slight moment coming out of one of the tight sections onto the main runway when Tom ran wide and clipped a boundary fence damaging the front bumper of the car but kept the fence intact. Tom finished third Overall and second in class .John Rintoul in another Fiesta R on the back of the recent win at Crail was on it all weekend but just couldn’t clinch the win this year, John finished second overall and took the class win.Alan Wallace in the distinctive green and white Mitsubishi Evo finished a very well deserved th overall and third in class. Harry Chalmers was a Mach  virgin and loved every mile of the venue. Harry commented at the end of the event they we had no problems at all on day one and the car ran faultlessly all day to give him a real confidence boost to push on harder and let him get used to some new parts on the car. Harry kept it neat all day and came away with rd overall after day one.Day two was very fast. Fastest he’s probably been in the car to date with these faster stages suiting faster cars Harry just had to push on brake late and keep it tidy and with that being said the team dropped to th overall due to some of the quicker cars retiring out.Harry said: #I couldn’t be happier for how this event turned out for the team and are all delighted with the result and how far they have come.#Harry also managed the full two days on the same Hankook Tyres Finishing th overall.Alan Stark in the stunning Red Mitsubishi Evo had decided he was playing the long game and would drive accordingly. The plan went well and they played about with tyres trying to make them last for the two days. On the second last stage on the Saturday the manold gasket started to blow and he lost a fair bit of power mid stage. The service crew managed to bolt it up again but the long stages were killing it and it usually faded about  rds in each time.On Sunday he decided to push on a bit and of course it bit him. The interior mirror fell off and he became aware there was a car coming up behind after a merge but wasn’t sure how close. He decided to do the next lollipop and then see where he was on the straight but in his enthusiasm got to him and he understeered into the bales bouncing off them, hitting his bonnet. He also noticed the brake pads were rattling more than usual and it turned out they had lost a pin. The team had to improvise with spare tyre borrowed from Allan Wallace which didn’t quite fit but they wired it in and it lasted.Class  had  STRC registered crews this year and top spot and current championship leader in class went to Colin Gemmell in the Mark  Escort. Colin had a trouble-free run on both days and managed to finish the event th overall just  seconds behind Tom Blackwood and second in class.Alistair Inglis winner of the  Mach  stages kept just ahead all weekend. Nothing could touch his car which stuck to the road like glue.Inglis said: #Overall victory and a class win  Can’t get any better.#Robert Marshall in the Mark  Escort was looking forward to some decent results but an issue on day one with the car losing all its water put an end to any real chances and on day two an engine mount broke putting an end to what Robert described as a perfect weekend.Ross Auld was a welcomethe Mark  Escort and also managed a couple of days assistance in setting up the venue. Ross had managed to set some decent times on Saturday but late in the day the alternator belt snapped and took with it the dry sump belt causing the engine to cease. Ross loaded up the car and headed home and by the Sunday evening he had the engine out the car ahead of its rebuild.Class  saw four STRC registered crews compete in Kintyre this year and top of the list was Greg Inglis in the Lotus Exige. Greg exited the last stage on the Saturday and noticed the rear brake calliper hanging off. A call was made to Montrose where a spare part was removed from a car and the handover was done half way between Montrose and Machrihanish. Greg finished a respectful fth overall and took the class win.Second in class and th overall was Michael Harbour in the Mark  Escort, on the back of electrical problems that saw the team fail to finish the last round at Crail the team have now got the car singing on the stages. Michael didn’t report any issues during the weekend and brought the car home in one piece.Michael Robertson isn’t having the best of luck this season as the Honda Civic Type R driver reported issues with the CV joint that led to driveshaft and df failure but as usual the team loved the event and will be back for sure.Class , with eight registered STRC in class  the battles were all tensely close. Taking top honours in the class was Kyle Adam a full two minutes ahead of nearest class  car of Des Campbell. Kyle also managed a top  overall clinching th spot and despite some overheating at one point the car ran faultlessly doing his championship hopes no harm.Lochgilphead local, Jamie Miller in the C R Max loves the track and had the luxury of booking indoor servicing. With navigator Ian McCulloch, his biggest problems were brake related but with some fluid changes and adjustments it was just all back to normal for the team finishing a well-deserved th overall and fourth in class.Kayleigh Strachan in the Citroen Saxo finished th in class on the event and th overall but managed to pick up  points and th in class in the STRC.Gary Coutts in the Fiesta commented after the final stage on the Sunday that on the second to last stage of day one he developed a few ‘minor’ issues. A change of driveshaft, ball joint, wheels and tyres seemed to cure the problem. With an early start on the Sunday morning the car was back on form. Loss of intercom on way to stage  and a half spin on stage  cost them a bit of time and after a few tweaks at service they were away again. The last stage of the day was cancelled resulting in a th overall and th in class.Alan Watt was again out in the green Saxo and finished th in class and st overall. A great result for the team with no damage or mechanical issues to report.Class  had four teams registered in the STRC this year at Mach  but only one managed to finish.

For example, we have baskets and containers full of stones, shells, ribbons and seeds that we’ve collected.#The nursery site is among the trees so there are lots of leaves, twigs and branches too.#We encourage the children to freely develop their ideas with everything we have here andthey have an idea of something they want to create, we try as much as we can to help them to do it.

Ardrishaig Bothy was open and help was on hand to introduce youngsters to riding a bike, or brush up on their cycle control skills. There was also a unique opportunity to join the th Duke of Argyll on a walking tour of the Crinan Canal as he uncovered the Chronicles of Crinan, butthat was too energetic then there was the option of sitting back to be entertained.Mid Argyll Pipe Band took time off from competition to play to the crowds. They joined some local bands who made sure toes were tapping from early morning until the end of the day.Of course, the main event was the ribbon cutting to formally open the Egg Shed and let the crowd who had gathered in Pier Square get a first look at the much-anticipated new building. Scottish Canals Chief Executive Catherine Topley together with Chief Executive of Argyll and Bute Council Cleland Sneddon addressed the crowd before enlisting the help of some young local helpers to help cut the ribbon and allow the first guests to flood in.As well as learning more about ‘Britain’s most beautul shortcut’, and its souvenir shop, the Egg Shed hosts a multi-purpose community space, free for the local community to use, which has a multitude of uses. It currently hosts an exhibition of Crinan Canal paintings by artist Richard Demarko, who when asked how he would describe them said they were: ‘a love letter to the Crinan Canal.’Mid Argyll Councillor Dougie Philand attended the launch and said: #It was a very well organised event and well attended. It sends out the signal that not only Scottish Canals but other partners are interested and are now investing in Ardrishaig. Long may this continue in order to regenerate the village back to the splendour it once enjoyed.#Councillor Donnie Macmillan, who also attended said: #I had a wonderful day at the opening of The Egg Shed. I would like to congratulate everyone who helped to make it a professional and successful day. Everyone involved played their part in a professional manner.#I hope this is an important part of the regeneration of Mid Argyll and I will continue to give them all my support in my duties as a councillor.#The Egg Shed is the latest marker in the regeneration of Ardrishaig Harbour and has already been taken to the community’s heart.

It is bounded to the west by Montgomerie Terrace.ldquoThe proposed new development will be accessed via a new access created off Montgomerie Terrace, with the two new houses towards the front of the site, which replace the existing ldquodoran pre-fab and former canoe shed, accessed off the B.ldquoThese proposed homes reflect high standards of design to ensure successful integration with the character of the local area, without damaging the design characteristics of the conservation area.ldquoThe materials, scale and height of the surrounding area have all been assessed to ensure the proposed development is in keeping with the existing housing.The plans attracted five objections relating to the height of the buildings in relation to nearby properties, and raised issues surrounding privacy and sunlight.However, at a meeting of Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee on Monday August , planning officers urged councillors to approve the plans.In a written submission to the committee, planning officer Julie Hayward writes: ldquoThe main issue with the development is the potential impact of the dwellinghouses proposed on plots five and seven on the light, privacy and outlook of Orchard House to the east due to the position of the proposed houses and dfering ground levels.ldquoThe agent has submitted a drawing to show the relationship between the three houses and section drawings showing ground levels.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the proposed house on plot seven, the proposed house would have two bedroom windows in the east elevation at ground floor level and would be on slightly lower ground. Applying the guidelines in the approved supplementary planning guidance, there would be no signicant loss of light or privacy to Orchard House from this property.ldquoIn terms of the impact of the house on plot five on Orchard house, the garage would be positioned on the eastern side of the proposed house and the decking is shown on the western side beyond the rear wing.ldquoThere would be a window and door to the garage and a window to a WC in the rear elevation, which are not considered to be habitable rooms. There would be a large glazed area in the rear wing serving the living room.ldquoThe house is on signicantly higher ground than Orchard House.ldquoAgain, when applying the approved guidance there would be no direct overlooking and no loss of privacy to the habitable rooms of Orchard House.Kelso councillor Simon Mountford said he did not object to the proposals, but wanted to see a design change: ldquoWhat we have here those very boring roof shapes, although I appreciate modern roofs do not have chimneys or anything to break them up a little bit.ldquoIrsquom wonderingwe could ask the developer to break up the roof lines with some new designs.Tweeddale West councillor Eric Small told the committee: ldquoIrsquom quite happy with the way itrsquos sited in this location, so Irsquom going to go with the officers on this one.

We knew it would last forever, but forever had its day.The Twin Peaks-inspired Love Dilation is as dark as it is atmospheric.But it is perhaps the utterly engrossing simplicity of Imprints that makes it so special.

Built around a single, beautully menacing chord, which apparently symbolises the background radiation in our universe, the finale discusses the search for discovering a unying theory of everything.To quote Small from Imprints, As you travel through space, you are displaced, imagining time. You exist like a plant, you bloom and you grow, then wither and die. But the one card you play, genetically, is always an ace.

at Barrel Law, near Hawick.In September, plans for an poundm wind farm were rejected by Scottish Borders councillors.The proposal would have seen seven turbines, of up to m in height, erected on land to the north-west of Roberton, near Hawick.The company behind the plans, Germany-based ABO Wind, then submitted an appeal to the Scottish Governmentrsquos planning and environmental appeals ision .As part of that appeal process, the DPEArsquos appointed reporter Elspeth Cook held a hearing at Forman Hall, Roberton.However, the hearing was simply to clary and define legal terms and certain technical standards in order to help inform Ms Cookrsquos decision.For example, one point of contention between Scottish Borders Council and ABO Wind is whether or not the combined appearance of Barrel Law and the existing wind turbines at Langhope Rig will create a lsquolandscape with wind turbinesrsquo or a lsquowind turbine landscapersquo, as per the legally-defined definitions.The councilrsquos position is that a distance of between -km is required in order to maintain the current landscape type in the valley, but ABO Wind suggest the turbines should be less than km apart, as they state that spreading out the two turbine sites would actually make the landscape look more saturated as the wind turbines would effectively cover a larger area.Furthermore, they state that a greater distance between the two developments would push the Barrel Law turbines outside of the topography which makes wind farms viable in this area.Appearing as part of ABO Windrsquos  of representatives, land and development consultant James Welsh told the reporter: ldquoIn our opinion we preserve the distinct identity of the two groups.ldquoThere are examples of wind farms being approved with similar distances between them but still being accepted as being clearly separate wind farms.ldquoTo insist on a greater separation would increase the effect of a cumulative effect between them.Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning consultant, Dr Guy Wimble, said: ldquoI donrsquot dispute that they are identiable as separate elements, my issue is the effect of the wind farms on the landscape, and recognising that they are two dferent wind farms not one development.ldquoThe proximity of them makes this appear more of a wind farm landscape rather a landscape with wind farms.ldquoWhile I accept that separating the developments would make the wind farms seem more spaced out, by putting them closer yoursquod increase density.John Campbel QC, appearing on behalf of a group of objectors called Barrel Law Action Group, said: ldquoIf you pull the wind farms apart then clearly you increase the area of cumulative effect.ldquoIf you pull them together, yoursquore going to increase the cumulative effect just by sheer numbers, and you lose the ability to discern the two as distinct entities.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, appearing in his capacity as Scottish Borders Councilrsquos executive member for planning and environment, told the hearing: ldquoIt seems to me that the guidance allows for developments in this area but doesnrsquot necessarily promote it.ldquoNo one is disputing that the two wind farms would be separate, wersquore working to find out what degree of separation would be appropriate.Mr Welsh responded: ldquoIf you increase to a km distance it will push all m turbines outwith the area that has been identied as having the appropriate topography for this type of development.Ms Cook also sought clarication on certain technical points, mostly surrounding tables and figures contained within ious reports submitted by the appellant and the local authority."},{"url":null,"title":"art-thou-shakespeare-cyclists","story":"BORDERS

I#ve been on many a demonstration in my time and this was one of the best.Rolling off the ferry on the Friday evening we were welcomed by a guard-of-honour standing along the pier waving saltires.The townsfolk turned out in droves to welcome us, waving saltires from windows and even stringing saltire bunting across the street at fourth-storey level. I had the romantic impression that the good folk of Campbeltown had been following the ious pro-independence rallies as they worked their way around the geography of Scotland and had just been waiting for their own town#s turn!The sun stayed out for us right until pm. Then the rain suddenly came down and we took down our Pensioners for Independence stall.  That evening Yes Kintyre put on a special party for us all with local musicians in the Argyll Arms Hotel.On Sunday some of us stayed on and explored your beautul peninsula. As the ferry pulled away that evening members of Yes Kintyre stood along the harbour wall holding up saltires to bid us farewell.Thank you all again for a memorable experience.Yours,Mary McCabe,Glasgow.Sir,It was my great privilege to attend yet another Open at Royal Portrush and to witness  year-old Oban golfer Robert MacIntyre finish tied sixth in his very first Major Championship.It was a wonderful performance, and confirmation, of the talent and the temperament we, the journalists, felt sure that he had.  He is now a Euro millionaire, but he remains an open, helpful and cheerful lad with both feet firmly planted on the ground, thanks to a great family and a strong desire to remain in his home town.I was at Glencruitten for the first time in June and soon discovered why Robert wants to go back there on a regular basis after weeks on tour.  It#s a terric club, no airs and graces.  They are very proud of Robert, and rightly so, but I very much doubtthey would allow him to lose his down-to-earth approach to international recognition.Yours,Jock MacVicar, Southend-born Scottishgolf correspondent and long-time Dunaverty member. Sir,Through the columns of your newspaper, may I express my grateful thanks to all the businesses, organisations, and iniduals, who donated to our fundraising, allowing the dancers to compete in the United States Highland Dancing Championships held recently in Las Vegas.We had a very successful trip, placing in both the Highland and choreography events. It’s installed in the dancers they are there to represent Campbeltown and the Dance School rather than any inidual, and hearing the town name announced at the presentation of trophies to our four trophy winners was a very proud moment indeed. The dancers fought every inch of the way to put our small town on the map.Our thanks once again to the following: MACC, Tangy Wind Farm, West Kintyre Wind Farm, Killieguer Caravan Park, DM Fabrication, Glenside Tractors, Howdens, Kintyre Youth Fund, McFadyens Contractors, Tesco Bags of Help, Jim Martin Supplies, Southend Parish Church, Peter McKerral  Son, C’town Co-Op, C’town Running Club, C’town Rotary Club, C’town Firemans Club, C’town Motor Co, C’town Rotary Club, C’town Loyal, C’town Common Good Fund, C’town Inner Wheel, C’town Community Council, Paul Grumoli, Mr and Mrs Brown, Mr and Mrs Russell, and Laura and Jake, Tesco Staff.Yours,James McCorkindale,McCorkindale School of Dancing.Sir,On Monday evening, July , five sacks of tin cans had been placed in the clear glass bin in Tesco#s car park. Some sort of gathering must have taken place over the weekend. You cannot run a countryyou can#t distinguish between a glass bottle and a tin can.At least something sensible is going to be done about the Rest and Be Thankful road. It was acceptable to try to prevent the hillside from being washed onto the roadway. It has been obvious for several months,not years, that that was not possible.At last someone has seen thata wide trench is dug between the hillside and the road, the hillside can still be washed down but will not reach the roadway.Yours,James W Mackay,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltown rallies to independence march","story":"The independence march through Campbeltown on Saturday was a huge success and put a real zest for le back into the town which has been too long forgotten.That was the view of organiser Manny Singh who despite his apparent sacking from the All Under One Banner organisation was very much still in charge at the Campbeltown march.Afterwards he said: #It was a huge success for Campbeltown and the biggest demonstration for decades. There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here. Local people were coming off the pavements and joining the procession so it created a good, positive vibe.Pro-Unionists opponents held their own counter demonstation. However, the march went off without any incident and there were no arrests, with only one warning which was drug related.A spit of rain earlier in the day failed to develop into poor weather as the marchers would round the town to hear speakers and listen to musicians at the rally at Kinloch Green.Mr Wilson said he was particuarly pleased at the turnout as there had been some confusion over whether the march would go ahead due to internal sions within the hierachcy of All Under One Banner, which has organised independence marches across the country.Following Mr Singh#s sacking, founder Neil Mackay resigned from his position on its national executive pending an internal investigation.Pro-UK Unionist group A Force For Good met the march on the shore front and say they filmed and counted the marchers, as they have at previous events, and afterwards claimed the turnout was just .Director, Alistair McConnachie, said: #All Under One Banner is basically the marching wing of the SNP. AUOB, and SNP MPs and MSPs, lie about the numbers which attend their marches, sometimes up to  or  times.#Unfortunately, they are not challenged by the Scottish media. The good news is that A Force For Good has a presence at every AUOB march.

are fortunate in Scotland to have a way out of such dficulties in the form of a Debt Arrangement Scheme , which is one of Scotland’s best-kept secrets.  It’s available from charitable organisations such as StepChange and from commercial debt advisers such as TC Debt Solutions, too.  It is a Scottish Government scheme that is legally binding and prevents creditors from taking further action against people who owe money.Set up back in  by the Scottish Government, the scheme allows people to freeze interest and charges on their debts and pay their debts off interest-free over a longer period of time.  This brings payments down to levels that people can afford and gives people the chance to get their lives back on track.  Interest and charges are simply written off.Apart from reducing debt, one of the best things about the DAS scheme is that it protects people from their creditors but is not a form of insolvency: people get to pay back their debt in an affordable way.  Lenders like the scheme because they know they will eventually get their money back – and borrowers like it because they don’t have to pay interest charges and they get longer to pay their debts off.  It’s a case of everyone wins.There’s plenty of information about the Debt Arrangement Scheme online at  www.aib.gov.uk debt-arrangement-scheme.  Thousands of people have used the scheme, but so many

summer tournament, winning the competition in , the one-off match was played in a good spirit, but it was the Pupils who found their ruthless streak to snatch a win in the closing minutes.Rhu, fielding a team with plenty of height and energy, featuring several former youth players from Dumbarton FC # and former teammates of Pupils’ playmaker Donald McCallum # threatened early on.At the other end, though, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils had first-half chances, with Scott Souden and youngster Calum McKillop both having one-on-one opportunities, but their efforts were stopped by the Rhu keeper.The second half exploded into le on the hour mark as former Sons youth Callum Scott made his mark for Rhu, turning inside his marker to curl a classy left-footed finish beyond stand-in goalkeeper Ellis Robertson.Undeterred, the Pupils searched for an equaliser, and were given the opportunity minutes later when a Rhu handball in the box was penalised by referee Thomas d’Alessandro.John McCallum, playing as sweeper in a back three with Fraser Wylie and Ross Souden, stepped up to send the keeper the wrong way and make it -.However, after a lapse in concentration, the Pupils conceded a second goal, a cleverly guided header from a near-post corner evading Robertson in goal.Then, with the -degree heat and high humidity making the game hard work for both teams, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils rallied to equalise.A sweeping move involving midfield trio Keith Mitchell, Stuart Crossan and Donald McCallum found Scott Souden, who made no mistake when bearing down on goal, lashing a right-foot shot past the Rhu keeper, to the delight of his teammates and the clutch of Campbeltonians making the long journey to spectate.Then, in the dying seconds, after seeing shots blocked at their own end, thanks to some vital interventions from Robertson, the Pupils stole a winner when midfield substitute Finn Scott was teed up by Scott Souden to slot the ball home low beyond the Rhu keeper, ensuring the visitors completed pre-season unbeaten.Pupils manager Campbell Robertson said: ‘The conditions were tough, but the boys played really well, and our shape was good too. We would like to thank Rhu Amateurs for their excellent post-match hospitality.’Meanwhile, the Pupils’ centenary season officially starts tomorrowwhen they host Argyll rivals Lochgilphead Red Star at Kintyre Park, in the SAFL’s aptly named Centenary Cup, with a pm kick-off.And with two more Saturday group matches to follow in August, firstly away to Dunoon and then at home to Tarbert, the Pupils will look to continue their dazzling pre-season form once the competitive action begins.Photograph:"},{"url":null,"title":"simply the best for james","story":"James was + after nine holes and then proceeded to put together an excellent back nine to finish on +.Meanwhile Donald had gone to + n the front nine only to fall back on the inward nine and finished on +.Result: , James Williamson +  ,  Donald Brown +  ,  Bill Brannigan +  ,  Sandy Watson +  , Ken MacMillan +  , Robert Cook  +."},{"url":null,"title":"letter trying to keep everyone happy","story":"We, as the private landowners, have endeavoured throughout the years to make this historical area  as fully accessible to the general public as possible.Our use of introducing a few sheep to graze down the grass over certain months of the year is our preferred method but often, when summer visitors appear, we find the animals get frequently disturbed and distressed with human contact , and very often remove them in busy months to avoid any upset.The larger access gate is frequently left wide open, leading to constant rounding up of the livestock and  posing a danger to the passing road users, with even the odd complaint about our animals ‘deposits’  around the Footprints area coming into the equation too.Changing climate conditions have ensured that bracken and other plant species have increased in volume as every year passes and with worry about the decreasing insect population and visiting dogs perhaps being harmed by ingesting sprayed grass, we have never used any chemical solutions to help keep the undergrowth at bay.Strimming has been used on occasions  but this, too, has produced complaints from the public about the unnecessary removal of wild flowers and plants that provide food for the visiting bird and butterfly population.Sign posts are often needlessly torn down and often used to fuel beach fires and barbecues, with even the old, fragile, stone dyke surrounding the area being constantly clambered over,  rather than using the access gate, causing stones to be dislodged and even the wall being  deliberately dismantled, in order to use the stones to construct fire pits for outdoor cooking.In short, we’ve found there are never any easy answers when it comes to trying to keep everyone happy.Yours,Catherine Barbour,"},{"url":null,"title":"top artist jolomo finds inspiration on his doorstep","story":"The latest exhibition by John Lowrie Morrison, which opens on Saturdayat the Archway Gallery in Lochgilphead, concentrates on paintings of Crinan and Knapdale, landscapes found within a few miles of his Tayvallich home.Although John’s work is now sought out by collectors all over the world, he continues to exhibit every August at his #local# gallery # this will be his th solo exhibition at the Archway.

He retired from the House of Lords in , but his lelong interest in and passion for politicsremains intact. And he is as engaged in the principal issue of the day as the rest of us. Not that he is any clearer as to what is going to happen.ldquoItrsquos very dficult to predict what this Prime Minister will do because he has said so many dferent things. He talks about leaving at any cost. He talks about there being a one-in-a-million chance of a No Deal Brexit. I donrsquot think he knows. I donrsquot think anybody knows. I think wersquore flying blind and I think that is deeply dangerous for the country.And how does he feel about that  ldquoExasperation and anger and in a sense, fear. Not for me. Irsquom  and Irsquom comparatively prosperous. One of the things that irks me particularly about leaving the Community is that it wonrsquot be people like me who will suffer. It will be people at the bottom of the heap. It will be the disadvantaged and the dispossessed. It will be generations in -or--yearsrsquo time. We are mortgaging the future of the least well off, and thatrsquos alien to all I believe in.And where in all this does his own party stand  Whither Labour  Does he know  ldquoNo. One of my complaints is we have failed to adopt a serious position over the great issue of our time, perhaps the great issue of the century where Britainrsquos future lies. Our party doesnrsquot have a firm position in either direction.Note that ldquowe. Hattersley remains a Labour man through and through. He is probably best known for his time as the partyrsquos deputy leader through the s when Neil Kinnock was trying tothe party to power during the Thatcher years. He was always seen to be on the right of the party, although today he declares himself a ldquoradical socialist. And he was critical of the Blair government at the turn of the century. The question today is what he feels about the party now.Later this week he is in Scotland to tell us. He is appearing at the Edinburgh International Book Festival to talk about the future of the party he has served for so long. What hersquos actually going to say, though, hersquos slightly reluctant to tell me.ldquoThere are a number of things the Labour party has to do to recover and get itself back into the mainstream of politics, he argues. ldquoBut Irsquom not going to tell you what they are. Otherwise, no one will come.For a few minutes we circle around the subject. Is the leadership part of the problem, I ask  ldquoYes. And I shall deal with that.Can that be changed  ldquoYou are going into forbidden territory, he says, laughing.Well, would it be fair to say that Corbynism is a kind of mirror image of Blairism, both movements in their own way deeply inimical to what the Labour party should stand for ldquoNo. I had very many reservations about New Labour because I am a radical socialist and Irsquom not sure they were. I believe in equality and Irsquom not sure they did. Some people will blame Corbynism on New Labour and the Third Way, but I donrsquot believe they are responsible for it. I believe that Blairrsquos was a good government that made one terrible mistake with Iraq. But, my word,Tony was leading the Labour party now, I think it would look very dferent.The ultimate question that must be asked, I suggest, is what Labour stands for now. ldquoYou are asking the fundamental question Irsquom addressing on Thursday. What is the Labour party for  And Irsquom going to say we havenrsquot made it clear what wersquore for. We were always, since our foundation, reluctant to talk about the principles, the ideology. Wersquod just rather get on with it. And now is a time when we have to define what we are for, what we are about.Whatever his opinion of the current Labour leadershipHattersley thinks there is no shortage of talent on the Labour benches. ldquoThe parliamentary party is more full of talent than any time in my political experience. Night after night you put Newsnight or Channel  News on and some backbencher yoursquove never heard of ndash quite often a young woman ndash will speak with immense ability, grasp, confidence, understanding. The parliamentary Labour party is full of people of very high quality. They need to say what we stand for.When it comes to Scotland, he is, as you might expect, a Unionist. ldquoBut I understand part of the reason for Scottish nationalism. And part of the reason is not just the desire for independence. Itrsquos that the Scottish National Party filled the radical vacuum that was in part left by Blairism. The Labour party lost some of its radical edge and the SNP took over. So,we had a genuinely radical Labour party ndash not an extreme Labour party ndash I think Labour would do much better than it is doing in Scotland.That may be wishful thinking on his part. But then, as he says, he can recall a time when Scotland had no Tory MPs. Hattersleyrsquos political le covers most of the post-war period and the sht from welfare state consensus to the confused, atomised, political present. He was born in  and served as the MP for Birmingham Sparkbrook from  to .He also had, as politicians of his era did, a hinterland. Hattersley has also been a successful writer. In his last book, Catholics, published two years ago, he revealed that his mother Enid OrsquoHara, ran away with a priest, Frederick Hattersley, two weeks after he had officiated at her wedding to another man. Itrsquos a remarkable revelation. Did learning his fatherrsquos story change how he looked back on his own le, I wonder  He thinks not.ldquoI wish I had known about it because my father and I were very close. But he was a very self-effacing, retiring, shy sort of man and I would have liked to known about this heroic moment in his le when he did this, in my view, wonderful thing. And it makes me unhappy because I think he didnrsquot tell me because he thought I would be ashamed of him. In fact, I would have been very proud of him and I wish I had known about it.When he was  Hattersley read a book about equality and it changed his le. Politics suddenly seemed a worthy ambition. The frustration may be that, after serving in the Harold Wilson and Jim Callaghan governments in the late s and through the s, he spent the rest of his political career in opposition as Labour toiled during the s and early s.What he did achieve in that time was to see off Militant, one of the things, Hattersley says, he feels most proud of. ldquoFor two or three years, two or three of us, two of us really, John Smith and me, spent our time going around the country saying the Labour party is better than it sounds. Speaking out for the real Labour party in the country. And somebody needs to do that again. Because some of the old people, literally some of those expelled years ago, are now back with card-carrying Labour membership doing the damage they did before. So, we must go over all that ground again. And I hope some people will emerge who will do it.John Smithrsquos untimely death in  left us pondering one of the great what s of modern British politics. Whathe had lived to lead the Labour Party into the  general election  Hattersley is in no doubt.ldquoIf John had lived, we would have had a proper Labour government. He would have won the election. He probably wouldnrsquot have won it with as big a majority as Tony. Tony reached middle classes that John probably wouldnrsquot have reached. But he would have certainly won the election. And not only would Britain have changed, the world would have changed, too. We wouldnrsquot have had Iraq. The damage that was done to Britain and the world from John Smithrsquos death is incalculable.Roy Hattersley will discuss ldquoThe Labour Partyrsquos Future this Thursday at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, at .pm."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-john-mcdonnells-edinburgh-declaration-caught-scottish-political-world-completely-surprise","story":"If anyone tells you that theyd expected this, theyre lying. McDonnells Edinburgh Declaration caught the Scottish political world completely by surprise. The SNP couldnt believe their ears. I initially thought his remarks, especially the reference to ldquothe English Parliament, were just a badly-briefed UK politician talking off the cuff. But no. It is now apparently UK Labour policy to accept the SNPrsquos call for ldquoindyref. Gobs were well and truly smacked.Most smacked of all were the Scottish Labour Partys. Their leader, Richard Leonard, was left speechless. The Shadow Chancellor had directly contradicted Labours  manesto promise to oppose a repeat referendum. Only in March, Leonard made clear in an interview with the Daily Record, that a future Labour government would, like Theresa May, refuse any request for a ldquoSection  Order to trigger a legally-binding referendum on independence. No s no buts.:Scottish Labour registers lowest level of income in nearly two decadesNot any more, it seems. The Branch Office, as the SNP like to call Scottish Labour, has been told to back the policy of their deadly enemy. Christmas has come early for Nicola Sturgeon, without the turkeys.Many Scottish Labour MSPs were incandescent, as was the former Labour shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray MP, who called McDonnell ldquoludicrous and demanded that he ldquoapologise to Richard Leonard , and reaffirm Labours policy of opposition to a referendum . Off-the-record comments from Scottish Labour figures were unprintable. Unionist Labour MSPs put together a statement ldquodeploring\" the change in policy. This backfired when it emerged they hadnt cleared it with Richard Leonards office.The Labour MP, Paul Sweeney, then added to the confusion by calling for a multi-option referendum including federalism, or devo max as it used to be called. This was once proposed by Alex Salmond in , and rejected by Labour and the Conservatives in favour of a binary Yes No question. Saying Labour were all over the place would be an insult to geography.So, what on earth is going on  Why was one of the key figures in the UK Labour party provoking a split on one of the most contentious issues in British politics  And right in the middle of the Brexit row. Labour is now ided every which way on the constitution: over Scottish independence and over leaving Europe. McDonnell has left the Scottish party an impossible task: trying to win Scottish votes without a policy on Scotland in a general election thats possibly weeks away.:Scottish Labour breaks silence over anti-semitism investigation by blasting \"biased\" BBCWhat seems to have happened is this. Labour, at a UK level, has started to think about forming much wider political alliances in future in order to defeat the rising tide of the right. This has been discussed by a number of Labour people, including the former BBC economics editor Paul Mason in his book Clear Bright Future.Mason has argues that Labour should abandon its traditional base in the white working class and the trades union movement, and look to creating a new progressive alliance, or ldquopopular front, with LGBT and BAME groups, and with other progressive political parties. Mason regards the SNP, unlike most other nationalist parties, as progressive and social democratic. On the eve of McDonnells Edinburgh interview Mason called infor ldquoa penalty-free independence referendum whenever Holyrood chooses.Im not saying that Paul Mason is writing Labour policy. Far from it. Many in the party regard him with suspicion, not least for appearing to abandon the working class. But it looks asthe Labour leadership has finally been persuaded that the SNP is not just a band of ldquotartan Tories, and that Jeremy Corbyn could do business with Nicola Sturgeon.Scottish Labour is anyway likely to be crushed again in the forthcoming General Wlection, while the SNP is in line for around  Westminster seats according to the polls. Its support would almost certainly be requiredLabour is to try to form a government, and McDonnells intervention could be an attempt to prepare the ground. Theres been no love lost between Corbyn and the mostly Blairite rump of the Scottish Labour Party, so he probably regards them as expendable.Not that Labour is admitting any of this. Indeed, the line from McDonnell in Edinburgh, echoed by the Shadow Business Secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey on Newsnight, is that Labour will not form any ldquocoalitions or pacts with anyone. Labour is still smarting from those Tory election posters in  which showed the then leader, Ed Miliband, in Alex Salmonds breast pocket. It is imperative for Labour, in England at least, to deny any hint of an alliance with the SNP.But Scotland is a dferent. A ing Labour government in Westminster would require the tacit assistance of the SNP, perhaps on a confidence and supply basis. At any rate, the UK party leadership seems to have decided that offering a referendum is a risk worth taking to help some future co-operation to happen. This is huge development and raises questions about whether Labour can still be called a Unionist party.Paul Hutcheon: the biggest threat to the Union is Scottish Labours disintegrationLast week felt asa dam has broken. After three years in which Scottish politics has been in suspended animation, suddenly everyone was talking about independence again. Even Conservative commentators like The Times Iain Martin are now calling for a referendum in five years. s Simon Jenkins believes independence itself is now unavoidable, and called on Westminster to plan for it now.Of course, a referendum may not deliver a Yes. The polls still show Scotland split down the middle on independence. But this is a vindication of Nicola Sturgeons cautious, constitutional approach to winning independence. It is a blow to her critics, who had been calling for an unauthorised referendum, or even UDI. The former SNP MP, George Kerevan, had been calling for mass civil disobedience to obstruct London transport. But this is a blow her internal critics will be happy to take for there is now a real possibility of a referendum in the next couple of years.That isLabour manages to defeat Boris Johnson ndash a big ask, perhaps, but far from impossible. There will likely be a vote of no confidence the Tory PM next month, and he will almost certainly lose. If Labour fails to form an alternative government in  days, then Johnson has to call a General Election. Hes hoping to delay polling day until after Brexit on October . But that is a risky tactic. Such constitutional jiggery pokery could easily alienate voters, many of whom are anyway unconvinced by Johnsons abilities.Just about anything could happen in the next few weeks. But what is not in doubt is that Scottish independence, or at least a referendum, is back on the agenda.

However, he loved children, and he loved writing. Baum wanted a daughter - he planned to call her Dorothy - but when his first child Frank was born in , Baum began inventing stories to entertain him, stories which would eventually be published as The Wonderful Wizard of Oz in August , with  sequels following.Baum was unsuccessfully adapting his Oz stories into films in the early years of Hollywood when he died at his home, Ozcot, in Calornia in . Twenty years later, in , Hollywood would finally work its magic on Baumrsquos creation and turn The Wizard of Oz into the most celebrated and influential film in cinema history.This week the movie marks its th anniversary. For a film which moulded the childhoods of millions, the story of how this strange fairytale came to the screen is far from kid-friendly. In fact, at times, itrsquos strictly for adults only.THE STUDIOIN , Louis B Mayer, the mogul who headed -Goldwyn-Mayer, the most glittering of Hollywoodrsquos dream factories, bought the rights to The Wizard of Oz for ,. The plan was to make a movie rivalling Disneyrsquos game-changing Snow White. MGM marked Oz lsquoProduction Number rsquo. It cost nearly m to make and was one of the most expensive productions ever, taking nearly  years to turn a profit. The filmrsquos lyricist, Yip Harburg, said the studio never banked on Oz making money: lsquoOnce a year they did a loser for prestige.In the s, the studio system ran Hollywood. Directors, writers, and actors were all lsquoownedrsquo by one of the big studios like MGM or Columbia. Studio bosses had final say, and below them the producer was king, not the director. Writers were told what movies to work on, as were directors and actors.Herman Mankiewicz, whorsquod go on to win an Oscar for Citizen Kane, was the first of ten writers attached to Oz. An alcoholic, his major contribution was the idea that the film should be shot in black and white when Dorothy is in Kansas, but in colour when shersquos in Oz. The American poet Ogden Nash stepped in briefly after Mankiewicz was taken off the project, but it was third writer Noel Langley, aged just , who made the script his own, and created much of the story, including the ruby slippers - although they were originally silver. However, he also had sprawling side stories involving the Wicked Witchrsquos son lsquoBulborsquo, which were later cut.Summer leaves: Scotlandrsquos top writers select their favourite literary fragmentsLangley, however, would see his career ruined by studio boss Mayer. After shooting ended, Langley was heard to publicly say: ldquoEvery time Mayer smiles at me, I feel a snake has crawled over my foot. He was blacklisted and couldnrsquot get another job for any studio.Langley watched the movie alone in a cinema on Hollywood Bouled when it was released. ldquoI sat and cried like a bloody child, he said. ldquoI loathed the picture. He wasnrsquot alone. The New Yorker called it a ldquostinkeroo. As Aljean Harmetz says in her book The Making of The Wizard of Oz: ldquoMost of the serious critics thought it dreadful.THE MUSICThe wrong man got the Oscar. When Oz won the Academy Award for Best Original Score it went to Herbert Stothart - house composer for MGM. The only problem was he hadnrsquot written any of the songs - the real work was done by lyricist and composer Yip Harburg and Harold Arlen. But under the studio system jobbing songwriters were treated as badly as jobbing screenwriters.Arlen and Harburg - later blacklisted as a communist during the McCarthy era - were paid a flat rate of , and given a bungalow at MGM to live and work in. Their first task was tackling ldquothe lemon drop songs - light, catchy tunes like Ding Dong the Witch is Dead and Wersquore Off to See the Wizard. Some tunes, like If I Only Had a Brain, had already been written for other musicals and just needed new lyrics.The idea for the filmrsquos anthem, Somewhere Over the Rainbow, came to Arlen when he drove past Schwabrsquos Drugstore on Sunset Bouled - a place that summed up the songrsquos sense of longing. The drugstore was famous for the wannabe movie stars who hung out there, and the legend that a beautul girl could get an agent before she finished her milkshake at the soda fountain.After his first preview of the movie, though, Mayer pulled Over the Rainbow from the film asking: ldquoWhy does she sing in a barnyard . Harburg and Arlan were horried. Harburg said the studio bosses were ldquoignorant jerks. Eventually, Mayer relented and allowed the song to remain. Other songs were not so fortunate - The Jitterbug took five weeks to shoot and cost pound, but ended up on the cutting room floor for the first release.As the filmrsquos biographer Aljean Harmetz says: ldquoWhat is most remarkable about the Wizard of Oz - and perhaps the mark of its success - is that one doesnrsquot really think of it as a musical.THE STARSMGM was famous for having ldquomore stars than there are in heaven. Judy Garland was one of  actors under contract with the studio when she was hired in , aged , on  a week. It was the beginning of a career which would bring Garland fame and adoration, as well as abject mental and physical suffering. She was a raw and sensational talent but not conventionally beautul, and in the Hollywood of the s that meant ldquothe teeth capped, the nose restructured, the thick waist held in by corsets, and the body reshaped as well as possible by diet and massage - as Aljean Harmetz describes how Mayer moulded his young star.The mogul even referred to Garland as his ldquolittle hunchback. He initially didnrsquot want her in Oz and tried to secure Shirley Temple, but she was under contract with th Century Fox. The trials and humiliations of child stardom led to a letime struggle with drink and drugs for Garland - eventually leading to her death, after a number of suicide attempts, by an accidental barbiturate overdose aged .Ray Bolger, Bert Lahr and Jack Haley - who played the Scarecrow, Cowardly Lion and Tin Man - were all seasoned vaudeville stars on higher salaries than Garland. Bolger was on  a week. Haley was a last minute replacement. Initially, Buddy Ebsen - who went on to star in the The Beverly Hillbillies - was cast as the Tin Man, but an allergy to aluminium make-up nearly killed him, and Haley stepped in.WC Fields was the first call for playing the Wizard - but he wanted too much cash, asking pound,, so Frank Morgan begged the studio for the role. Morgan was not a star, but a charming alcoholic. He carried a briefcase filled with Martinis so he was never without a drink. In an astonishing coincidence, a frock coat bought from a second hand store for Morganrsquos costume was found with a label stitched inside - it read lsquoL Frank Baumrsquo, and was authenticated as the writerrsquos. When shooting wrapped, Morgan gave the coat to Baumrsquos widow.The Wicked Witch might have turned out very dferentproducer Mervyn Le Roy had his way - he wanted a glamorous villainess, all sequins and figure-hugging dresses. Studio bosses scotched the idea, and the role fell to Margaret Hamilton who made the part her own.Hamilton was a -year-old single mother who, although shersquos terried generations of children, is recalled by all who knew her as a kind, gentle, clever and funny woman. Playing the Good Witch Glinda was Billie Burke, the bejewelled we of Florenz Ziegfield, of Ziegfield Follies fame. When her husband died leaving her half a million in debt, Burke turned to the movies to stay afloat. Burkersquos dressing room had satin walls and a pink chaise-longue, Hamiltonrsquos was a canvas tent.:Brian Cox on bringing Logan Roy and Succession home to ScotlandThere was one final star to cast: Toto - played by Terry, a female Cairn Terrier, who suffered from chronic shyness. Despite a tendency to hide when there was loud noises, Terry was hired on pound a week. By that stage of her career, -year-old Garland was on pound.THE MUNCHKINSldquoWe had a hell of a time with those little guys, producer Mervyn LeRoy recalled. ldquoThey got into sex orgies at the hotel. We had to have police on every floor hellip Everything you can imagine sexually was going on.Screenwriter Noel Langley remembers ldquoshowgirls being escorted to their rooms by armed guards. Judy Garland once said: ldquoThey were drunks. They got smashed every night and the police had to pick them up in butterfly nets.Others described the Munchkins as an ldquounholy assemblage of pimps, hookers, and gamblers.One Munchkin actor bit a policeman, a few were known to carry knives, and some female Munchkin actors did solicit the crew. But as the filmrsquos biographer Aljean Harmetz says most were well-behaved. ldquoMemories are distorted because the activities of [a] few hellip were applied to all the Munchkins.In fact, many - whorsquod been exploited and abused due to their disabilities - were shy and vulnerable. This was the era when most of the  little people needed for the film could be hired from a company called lsquoSingerrsquos Midgetsrsquo, on five dollars a day.The lsquobig worldrsquo was also dangerous. Attendants were hired to take some to the bathroom after one actor fell down a toilet and couldnrsquot get out.SHOOTINGOz had four directors. Richard Thorpe for two weeks, George Cukor for three days, and King Vidor for ten days - but it was Victor Fleming who got the credit and put in the most work over four months. Fleming also took the Best Picture Oscar from Oz with his other film of  Gone With the Wind.Fleming was macho to the bone. He shot wild cats outside his Bel Air home, and had a particularly vile party trick of killing flies and eating them. He was a flamboyant anti-communist with his own plane, and infamous for womanising. During one confrontation on set, Fleming lost his temper with Garland who was unable to stop laughing at the clowning of Lahrrsquos Lion.John Lee Mahin, a screenwriter friend of Fleming who was on set, recalled: ldquoThey must have done the scene ten times and eventually she was giggling so much she got hysterical. She couldnrsquot stop laughing. And Vic slapped her on the face. lsquoAll right now,rsquo he said, lsquogo back to your dressing room.rsquo She went. And when she came back she said, lsquoOk.rsquo And they did the scene.The shooting was exhausting and gruelling - especially for the Lion, Tin Man and Scarecrow who suffered through y make-up sessions and baking arc lights. By lunchtime, with their make-up melting, the crew found them so ldquodisgusting to look at that the three ate alone in their dressing room.Garlandrsquos breasts were bound with cloth to keep her looking pre-pubescent, causing her considerable pain, but she never complained. Many of the crew worked round the clock and the place was awash in alcohol.Filming was plagued by accidents - thanks to the demanding and physical special effects. Betty Danko, stunt double for Margaret Hamilton, was crushed on set. Hamilton was badly injured when she caught fire during a scene where the witch disappears in a puff of smoke. Her face was burned and the skin on one hand completely removed, exposing the nerves. She was unable to film for six weeks. When she ed, Fleming grasped her so hard by the injured hand that she almost fainted.LEGACYAlthough the film has earned billions to date, it initially made a loss of about m at the box office. However, its real legacy isnrsquot financial but cultural. Its simple message of family, hope and home caught the imagination of a public about to face six years of war in Europe. Its arrival on TV at Christmas from the s to the s secured its place in the hearts of babyboomers and Generation Xers. The gay community embraced Garland as a suffering icon.Director David Lynch once said Oz influenced every film made since . His own movie Wild At Heart is a love letter to Oz. Steven Spielbergrsquos AI is Oz reimagined with robots. Musicians have been inspired by it, like Elton John with Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. If therersquos a list of all time great movies, Oz is there, usually at the top. Its words and symbols, songs and ideas are weaved into everyday le. How often do you hear someone say lsquoWersquore not in Kansas anymorersquo, or refer to a villain as lsquothe Wicked Witch of the Westrsquo. The Wizard of Oz has shaped our imaginations from childhood to adulthood - which is why even at the ripe old age of  it will continue to live on long after all of us have quit the stage.Ray Bolger the Scarecrow said it was the moviersquos ldquosimple philosophy which made it immortal: ldquoTherersquos no place like home, everybody has a heart, everybody has a brain, everybody has a soul."},{"url":null,"title":"issue-day-comic-con-scotland","story":"When is it taking place The Royal Highland Centre in Ingliston, Edinburgh, on October  and .So who will be there For such a young event, itrsquos proving to be a big draw - top of the bill this year is Belgian action hero Jean Claude Van Damme, star of movies such as Kickboxer, Street Fighter and The Expendables .And you can buy the lsquoPlatinum JCVD Experience rsquoYou sure can - for a tidy pound,  people can have a ldquounique once in a letime experience.For that price, you receive a package that includes a signed photograph in a commemorative frame, a professional photo with the -year-old actor and tickets to an intimate talk about his le and career, after which he will do a ldquomeet and greet around the audience, which is limited to only  people.

mine in Cononish for  years and claims it will now be able to begin commercial gold production later this year.If successful, this will be the first time in decades that the precious metal has been mined in Scotland.Richard Gray, managing director and CEO at Scotgold, said he believes the the project will ldquoprovide a signicant boost to the local economy around Tyndrum.In the latest raft of funding for the firm, finance provider Simply has loaned the project pound,, which has been used to purchase equipment including an excavator, a loading shovel and a dumper.It is hoped that this will give the firm the last push it needs to be fully operational by the end of the year.Ross Pickburn, regional sales manager at Simply, said: ldquoThis was an incredibly interesting deal to work on, not least because it was the first gold mine Irsquod ever helped fund.ldquoItrsquos great working with a company that produces Scottish gold and a team that is creating jobs in the area.ldquoWe got to know about the needs of the company and were able to structure a deal that worked for all parties.Scotgold acquired the Cononish site in  and has embarked on a long journey to bring the mine up to a workable state and start producing gold.Planning permission for the project has been agreed, subject to certain conditions, by Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority, while the business also recently renegotiated and extended a secured loan deal with Nat le Roux, its chairman and ldquomajor shareholder.The loan facility from Mr le Roux, who is a former chief executive of the IG Group, is said to have increased by up to poundm to poundm.At one point Scotgold predicted that gold and silver production at the site could reach as much as pound million per year over a seven-year lespan.However, this has changed over time due to fluctuations in the price of gold.Experts think there could be as much as five tonnes of gold to be found in the hills near Tyndrum, encased in quartz which must be dug out and crushed.Up to , ounces of precious metals could be mined per year, and the project could create around  jobs for local people.Villagers in nearby Tyndrum, a popular stop on the route north to Glencoe and Fort William, hope to open a visitors centre and market Cononish gold to tourists.Scotgold produced its first gold from Cononish several years ago during a bulk ore processing trial at the site.It was later sold for an average of pound, per ounce, a more than three-fold premium on the average gold price of the day.The mineral was sold in the form of ldquorounds minted by Baird and Co Bullion Merchants.The first round, embossed, like all the coins, with a stagrsquos head, was snapped up by Graham Donaldson, a Scotgold shareholder who lives in Christchurch, Dorset.His bid of pound,.p was the highest.At the time of the sale, he said: ldquoAs to what I would do with it now, I would probably look at it and stroke it, and put it in a safe.Mr Donaldson said he and his we planned in time to get new engagement and wedding rings made from Cononish gold, to replace the budget rings they bought when they married.ldquoThose are worn thin, he added.Scotgold, which also has offices in West Perth, Australia, believes its gold will attract a premium price as a niche product for tourists, jewellers and couples keen on Scottish gold wedding or engagement rings.The firm also previously announced it had struck a deal with a prominent jeweller to manufacture the first items made from Scottish gold.Exploration work in another area - the Grampian gold

wind and watertight accommodation in remote locations which are left unlocked for anyone to use and have become popular with hillwalkers and climbers.Scattered throughout the wilder parts of Scotland, England and Wales they are the shepherdsrsquo cottages, huts and similar buildings many of which in the normal course of events might be allowed to fall derelict.Very few are less than a century old

Bernard Heath after he spotted a remark in the visitor book at the Backhill of the Bush bothy in Galloway Forest park, suggesting the setting up of a club to save a growing number of deserted farm buildings from ruin.He felt a collective effort was needed to keep the abandoned cottages and huts weatherproof in order ldquoto maintain simple shelters in remote country for the use and benefit of

They obtain the ownersrsquo permission to maintain buildings as bothies and to make them available as open shelters.MBA volunteers are tasked with visiting the buildings to look for any structural faults or cosmetic issues that need fixing or more fundamental renovation. And it is the volunteers that carry out the restoration and maintenance work which is financed by member subscriptions and by donations.The charity revealed that their latest annual spending on the bothies has risen by % and expect that the expenditure will not stop there.Neil Stewart of the MBA said: \"We now look after  bothies plus two emergency mountain shelters throughout Scotland, Wales and northern England.\"Through membership fees and generous donations we managed to spend a record sum of pound, on bothy maintenance in  and managed to increase our membership to over , - an increase of %.\"These buildings are however in remote areas and subject to the worst ravages of the weather so ongoing repair and maintenance is required.

who has a background in working with at-risk young people and developing environmental learning programmes for schools.In the Highlands and Western Isles, every summer would see women and children migrating to higher land with the cattle for summer grazing. There they would live in simple huts, shielings, making butter and cheese, with the younger generation learning about themselves and their heritage from the elders.:It is exactly that spirit of community and transmission of customs that Dr Harrison and partner Karen Marshall, who runs the projectrsquos outdoor nursery, are working so hard to maintain.The Shieling Project was dreamed up  years ago when Dr Harrison, who at the time was a nomadic educator, travelling from school to school helping children paint a ldquopicture of the richness of where they lived.He dreamed of having a permanent site where he could rear livestock and teach people the value of working with, and for, nature. It was during the study of his PhD in Place Based Education that the idea began to crystallise.He said: ldquoI was thinking about the shieling as a way of educating kids because thatrsquos how they learned about the wider natural landscape. In the old days, they went up to the shieling, they found about all the place names and all the plants and animals out there.ldquoI loved the idea of kids being in the outdoors, running around the hills, learning about them, looking after the cows, fending off the wolves, singing all the songs around the fireplace.ldquoEventually, I just kind got to a stage where I had no choice but to start.Six years on and the project now has  employees who welcome school and private groups to pitch in while learning lost skills.The project represents the value of how communities used to live. Dr Harrison said: ldquoItrsquos a reminder that we managed to live for a very long time in a sustainable way. There were more people living off the land who were were self sufficient.Careful not to romanticise what would have been a hard le, Dr Harrison believes modern societies would only benefit from reconnecting with the wild.He said: ldquoI think nowadays when we think about environmental issues, we just think humans are bad but the Shieling is giving children a story that people arenrsquot inherently bad but were part of a healthy eco-system.ldquoThe Shieling is a little tradition that has got a big message about what wersquore struggling with today about sustainable communities.Children, young people and adults come to the project to learn how to tend to animals, grow food, cook and turn off their devices to collaboratively create a culture for themselves through songs, storytelling and film.Guests help construct low carbon buildings and monitor the energy they are using while on site.:Dr Harrison said: ldquoTypically environmental education has been disaster education. How rubbish everything is, attempting to motivate change by guilt and shame. Here, and especially for children, we think that a stronger motivation is love, enjoyment, care for a place.ldquoHere we let people experience a bit of off grid living and be outside for long periods of time. All this adds up to skills for a sustainable future, but it also adds up to fun, to a sense of mental and physical well-being.Dr Harrison hopes that visitors might then see any changes they need to make to adapt to and mitigate climate change as positive.He said: ldquoIn terms of educating children like this, the idea is that we try and use practical experiences so wersquore getting peoplersquos bodies and minds engaged, because most of schooling is either sitting being told stuff or is virtual and itrsquos not engaging peoplersquos bodies and hearts, as well as their minds.It is during the practical experiences of making a basket or digging up peat or feeding calves where young people can think through the ideas they are being taught and ldquolive through some of the big questions being asked.Dr Harrison said: ldquoYou canrsquot ask a child what a stable future looks like and expect an answer in a minute. They need weeks or years or lives to think about that. And they also need to experience it, rather than just have it as an abstract thing, because thatrsquos the problem with all these big things like climate change, sustainability, and bioersity, theyrsquore so huge. How do you get hold of it  How do you understand it  How do you make it real in a way that you can hold on to and do something about it ldquoOtherwise, itrsquos just like, lsquooh, Irsquom scared about thatrsquo, because itrsquos just an idea.The untraditional gender politics of the historical shielings is another teaching arm of Dr Harrisonrsquos programme. While the men remained in the low lands with the burgeoning crops, the women took the cattle, and therefore all the wealth, up to graze.He said: ldquoThat alone was fairly unusual in some of these traditional cultures where the men tend to be fairly entrenched in their power positions.Children are ldquowonderfully resilient, and flexible and open to new ideas but are not able to make the choices about how they live and what they do.Dr Harrison said: ldquoWhat wersquore trying to do is show that sustainability is a way of being happier and healthier and having fun.ldquoWe want them to see that we can build up build some of our buildings, we can grow some of our food, we can take our entertainment, art, and cultural experience back into our own control and do it ourselves. We can actually have a feeling that wersquore involved in our landscape and our community.The beauty of the project is that it looks both backwards and forwards to inform its teachings.Dr Harrison said: ldquoWersquore asking what the future is going to look like, and what does that mean to you."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-working-class-solidarity-not-end-borders","story":"In  Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the STUC, the Scottish churches and civic Scotland agreed the Claim of Right which asserted the sovereignty of Scotland within the UK. It stated that the signatories acknowledge the sovereign right of the Scottish people to determine the form of government best suited to their needs and do hereby declare and pledge that in all our actions and deliberations their interests shall be paramount. The Claim of Right was launched at a historic ceremony in the General Assembly Hall in Edinburgh. I attended as Vice -Chairman of the Scottish Labour Party. It was signed by every Labour and Liberal Democrat MP who were currently serving, including Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling, except Tam Dalyell. The Claim of Right was the genesis for the  Scotland Referendum which led to the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament. The Claim of Rights was endorsed by the Annual Conference of the Scottish Labour Party and this position has never been rescinded.This does not mean that Scottish Labour cannot campaign against independence in a referendum as they did in , supporting the status quo or some form of devo max. However, I agree with our former First Minister, Henry McLeish that Scottish Labour must have positive and radical policies for a new constitutional settlement.Richard Leonard passionately argues that the problems and solutions for working people are class-related and not those of national identity. He is right. But where and at what level those class solutions are applied are for voters to decide on tactical and other considerations. Working-class solidarity does not and never has ended at borders.There is also a lot of hypocrisy from Labour MPs and MSPs who support a second referendum on Brexit but oppose a second referendum on independence, the democratic principles are the same.I am a long-time supporter of devolution of power not just to the countries and regions of Britain but to communities. Our unwritten constitution is in desperate need of reform, a fairer voting system, abolition of the unelected House of Lords, an elected head of state with specied powers to hold ministers to account, and much more.Bob Thomson, Past chairman treasurer, Scottish Labour Party, Glasgow G.AS a \"tribal\" Labour voter who may never vote Labour again, could I suggest to Jeremy Corbyn, John McDonnell, Diane Abbott, et al that they should consider leaving and, instead, take over an obscure student union somewhere far away and play their infantile games there, as this is clearly their level. This would allow the grown-ups a chance to revive a once-great party and provide a credible challenge to one of the worst governments in living history.Jim White, Glasgow G.REGARDING the many letters you have published over recent days about the increasing woes of the Labour Party, I note that they iniably refer to \"Scottish Labour\" or even the \"Scottish Labour Party\", but according to the Electoral Commission, Labour in Scotland is registered merely as an accounting unit of the UK Labour Party.It is hard to whip up enthusiasm for an accounting unit, and as Richard Leonard sits Miss Haversham-like in his branch office,amid the ruins of his expectations, he should admit thathe and his members have no aspirations for their Scottish accounting unit it is hardly surprising they have no aspirations for Scotland.Ruth Marr, Stirling.THE SNP would like Scotland to leave the UK but remain in the EU. However,Scotland left the UK, before or after the UK left the EU, then Scotland would be both outside the EU and outside the UK.Most people would agree that for Scotland to prosper it must agree trading terms with both the rUK and the EU, possibly becoming an EU member state. I am told by nationalists that the UK Government does not care about Scottish interests. Nationalists portray Westminster as the villain. Irsquom then puzzled by the seemingly contradictory idea that somehow Westminster would be better disposed towards Scotlandit were to become independent. I would have thought a separate rUK would put its own interests first and at the expense of Scotlandrsquos. While Irsquom sure Scotland could become an EU member, the terms of its joining are not decided by the people or the Government of Scotland, it would be on EU terms.Outside both the UK and EU, Scotland would need to find secure trading partners and make trade agreements quickly. This is also the weakness in Brexit it is not a strong negotiating position, even for a large country. The argument that Scotland has great natural assets that other countries will compromise their interests over is simply wrong. Except for niche brand luxury products, for example whisky, there is nothing that can be found in Scotland that cannot be sourced, cheaper and in greater quantity where, this includes financial services, energy, petrochemicals, timber and food.I suggest it would be a serious mistake to leave the UK, eventhe UK leaves the EU. There is little to be gained from compounding the current Brexit situation. If Scotland left the UK I think many people would be disappointed with the result.James Reilly, Turrf.CHRISTINE Grahame, SNP MSP , displays selective memory loss.

And so, hersquos thinking a new pro-yes party could bring in more regional list votes for the cause.On the face of it, the theory seems sound. The Holyrood electoral system was set up with the aim of making it dficult for any one party to get a majority which means a party that performs well in the first-past-the-post seats will find it harder to make gains on the regional lists.:Jim Sillars: Wings over Scotland plan for a new party could \"split\" pro-indy voteYou can see this from the last election. The SNP did well in the list vote, but because it also did well on first-past-the-post, it was the other, mainly unionist parties that picked up the list MSPs. Mr Campbellrsquos idea is that a Wings party could change this by taking some of the list votes that are being ldquowasted on the SNP, therefore increasing the chances of a Yes majority.But the theory has over-looked two important factors. First, the SNP wonrsquot stand for it. At the last election, they ran a ldquoBoth votes SNP campaign based on the theory thatthey lost some first-past-the-post seats, they could pick up seats on the regional list ndash and that was despite the fact there were other pro-independence parties standing on the list, such as Rise and the Greens. Adding another party based on Wings is not going to change that.Second, Mr Campbellrsquos theory is based on the idea the SNP will broadly retain the number of first-past-the-post seats they have at the moment, but thatrsquos far from certain. Whether we like it or not, the next Scottish election will be fought on a single issue ndash whether the pro-Yes parties should be given a majority to demand another referendum ndash and in that scenario many,not most, supporters of the union will vote tactically against the SNP, and that means the party could lose some first-past-the-post seats. Combined with losing list votes to Wings, this could put a pro-independence majority at risk.There are also particular problems with a party based on the Wings brand, the main one being its aggressive image. Mr Campbellrsquos traditional response to this has effectively been ldquochill, itrsquos just banter but the SNP leadership knows the more aggressive nationalists have damaged the cause in the past and a party based on Wings would only heighten the problem. Yes, any Wings party would only be an outer limb of the Yes movement, but political poison could spread quickly through the bloodstream.:Labours Tom Watson: Scottish indyref is not the answerThe Wings party would also do something  damaging: it would draw attention to the dis-satisfaction within the Yes movement ndash indeed, the ision appears to be one of the reasons Mr Campbell is considering starting up the party in the first place.In his blog discussing the idea for example, Mr Campbell said SNP supporters didnrsquot want to vote for ldquoextreme radical fringe parties like the Greens because they donrsquot want to ldquofill womenrsquos changing rooms and toilets with male rapists. This, of course, is a reference to his opposition to the proposals to allow trans people to identy their own gender, but itrsquos only one of the SNP policies he dislikes.You might say: who cares about these disagreements over policy as long as everyone agrees on the bigger aim of independence  But part of the success of the yes movement in  in growing so rapidly was that the dferent groupings more or less fell in behind Alex Salmond. A new Wings party, on the other hand, could provide a mouthpiece to those within the independence movement who are unhappy with Nicola Sturgeon over a range of issues: among them, trans rights, the timing of a second referendum, and the swing towards austerity, as some see it, that was signalled with the Growth Commission. If the yes movement is, and looks, ided ndash particularly over the economy ndash voters will fear a Brexit-style debacle and will be more likely to vote no.And, finally, we have the image problem: what would a Wings Over Scotland party actually look and sound like  Famously, David Cameron once dismissed UKIP as a bunch of fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists and therersquos a real danger that a Wings party would attract people from the extremities of the independence movement in a similar way.You know the ones I mean. The ones who are blatantly anti-English. The ones whose arms ache from waving saltires. The ones who believe Mr Campbell didnrsquot really lose the defamation case against Kezia Dugdale. And the ones who suggested that the women who accused Alex Salmond of sexual assault might have ldquothrown themselves at him. Presumably some of this bunch would stand for the Wings party and what a sight that would make.I appreciate, of course, that none of this may happen in the end, but the success Mr Campbell has made of his blog would suggest therersquos a decent chance of him making a success of a party too.The problem is that, in real politics, the megaphone hersquos been pointing at people who think like him will be turned on an entirely dferent audience: voters who need to be convinced therersquos a coherent, rational and calm plan for Scottish independence.Those kind of voters are unlikely to be impressed by Mr Campbellrsquos aggressive style.

Internal features such as stone benches have also been found along either side.The hall is oriented towards the sea and finds include steatite , pottery, a bone spindle whorl and a fragment of a Norse bone comb.The find provides tantalising evidence of the earliest phases of inhabitation on this farm and settlement mound which may well have been inhabitated for over , years.It provides another piece to the ,-year jigsaw along this archaelogy rich stretch of coast as Westness in Rousay — described as the #Egypt of the North#.A team of archaeologists from the University of the Highlands and Islands Archaeology Institute, Rousay residents and students have been digging at the site for a number of years, investigating the later stages of the farm complex and its waste heaps with a particular focus on past diet, farming and fishing practices.Although only partly uncovered at this stage, the Skaill hall has parallels with other Norse halls excavated in Orkney, such as Snusgar, and where in Scotland.The excavation is part of the Landscapes of Change — Archaeologies of the Rousay Clearances and Westness Estate project which is exploring the Skaill farmstead.The present farm at Skaill dates to the th and th centuries and was part of the Rousay clearances during the mid-th century.The name Skaill suggests the site was home to a Norse hall or drinking hall, and was a high status site.Westness is mentioned in Orkneyinga saga as the home of Sigurd, a powerful chieftain, so it was always likely that a Norse settlement was located somewhere at Skaill.Earlier structures have been found below the present farm during previous seasons, and this season explored more of the Norse phases of the site.Three dimensional models of the farmstead can be found here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Striking the balance between conservation, farming and hunting can be dficult. Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, enabling them to control goose numbers sustainably, and sell goose meat for profit.”Until now, meat generated by the Orkney resident greylag goose project could only be sold locally by retailers based on Orkney.SNH is working to secure longer-term arrangements for the sale of resident greylag goose meat in Scotland.

The Scotsman believes Mr Brown to be entirely correct.Prime Minister Boris Johnson campaigned for the UK to leave the EU on the promise that the process would be straightforward and the benefits great and bounteous. Only those in the most profound state of denial can still believe that.Mr Brown warns that the UK is now sleepwalking into oblivion. This may be true of those who continue to believe the fairytales peddled by pro-Brexit politicians but those who are leading the charge for the UK to crash out of the EU, without even the mitigation of a deal, know precisely what they are doing. Rather than sleepwalking, they are wide-eyed and energised. Those who have voted Labour in the past - indeed, anyone who believes in the value of a decent and thoughtful politics - may find it rather depressing that Mr Brown has had to fill the intellectual void on Brexit created by the current leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn.It is Mr Corbyn who should be making the case against a No Deal Brexit but his career-long Euroscepticism and his lack of political acumen mean he is a completely ineffectual figure in this debate. In fact, he barely registers as a participant in these must turbulent of times.In Mr Corbyn’s absence, Mr Brown warns that the ideals of an inclusive outward-looking Britishness could not survive the isiveness and chaos of a no-deal Brexit and insists that No Deal Brexit must be stopped in its tracks.However, eventhe will to stop the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal exists in the House of Commons, they may be unable to act,The Institute for Government warns that MPs may have limited opportunities to stop a No Deal scenario. It looks increasingly likely that the UK’s exit from the EU will be brutal and messy. The Scotsman believes this will represent a catastrophic act of recklessness on the part of the Prime Minister and his acolytes. And we are deeply concerned about what the ensuing chaos will mean for the future health of our democracy.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch are the english more convinced about independence than scots","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...It seems that many south of the Border are surprisingly clear-sighted about independence, writes Lesley Riddoch.The “good riddance” message came loud and clear mid-June when a YouGov poll found  per cent of Tory party members want Brexit eventhat leads to Scottish independence. But now that Lord Ashcroft’s poll has confirmed that the feeling ismutual, there’s been a tidal wave of influential opinion pieces from the English left, urging Scots to launch the leboats and save ourselves. According to Matthew Norman in the Independent: “Were I Scottish, I would be mad for independence. I’d say sod the crude oil price [and] sod the Barnett formula.” Last week John McDonnell’s surprise revelation that Labour will not block a second independent referendum prompted the ’s John Harris to promise: “If another independence vote materialised … I would be back there [Scotland] in a flash, to seeat least one part of these islands can leave behind the current wretchedness, and find something better.” Yesterday the Observer carried a long piece from Aberdeenshire, where  per cent voted No in . Harriet Sherwood observed: “In Inverurie’s market square, most willing to express a view appeared to favour independence. But many who declined to discuss their political leanings may be supporters of the Union.” That’s perfectly true, but Sherwood’s piece is full of quotes from No voters ready to publicly admit they’ve changed their minds or at least are open to argument. Simon Jenkins’ no-holds-barred Comment is Free column last week was the most widely circulated on social media. Clearly no heartfelt supporter of independence, Jenkins surveyed the long history of English indference to first Irish and then Scottish Home Rule campaigns, compared Scotland’s flatlining GDP with that of soaring Denmark and suggested “separatists” should thank Boris and Brexit for hammering the final nails into the Union’s coffin: “If I were a Scot, I would vote for independence tomorrow. I would want nothing more to do with the shambles of today’s Westminster Parliament.”Scots-born Times’ columnist Iain Martin insists the end of the Union isn’t preordained but admits the “most ominous news for unionists” was that only  per cent of Ashcroft’s poll sample thought Scotland would vote to stay in the UK in a second independence poll. Actually the truly ominous news was probably already known. The UK Government’s private polling has remained unpublished in Scotland for obvious reasons – but Boris Johnson would be well aware of its contents. So, everything from the “do or die” Brexit declaration to the ridiculous  pence coin “celebration” has occurred in the full knowledge they are driving Scots towards independence. Clearly the Minister for the Union believes that’s a price worth paying. Martin’s solution has already been outlined by others without the capacity to enact it: “A commission devolving maximum powers across Britain, on taxation, for example, and something closer to a federal collection of states, pooling defence and foreign affairs [with] an elected replacement for the Lords in the shape of a Britain-wide senate.” Friend, it ain’t gonna happen and everyone knows it. Gordon Brown’s weekend intervention ironically confirms that the F-option is stone dead. Five years after his fateful Vow, the former Labour leader insists that, “to prevent the rise and rise of dysal nationalism, the first step is to stop no-deal in its tracks”. Really.Quite apart from the Ashcroft poll’s revelation that  per cent of Scottish Labour voters also back “dysal nationalism” , SNP politicians have been highly visible in the legal action that won the right for MPs to revoke Article  and will be part of this week’s court bid to stop Johnson suspending parliament. Despite taking pelters for their troubles, Nicola Sturgeon and her MPs are trying to stop no-deal in its tracks far more constructively than the party Brown once led. In fact, his stale rhetoric only serves to remind voters that “a system of government as close to federalism as you can have” never materialised. Instead the Brexit power grab and new Westminster plans to spend cash directly in Scotland mean the Vow is meaningless and its architect is lost in time. Still, the intervention of the English Left and prominent Remainers is strange, given that Scotland’s departure would leave them with a near-permanent Tory majority – or whatever worse fate awaits once Brexit delivers economic disaster. Are they motivated by a selfless “you go, because we can’t” sentiment or by enlightened self-interest – “you create a sane, social democracy because we may need escape north soon” A friend went south last month to visit English relatives who were quite hostile to independence first time around. Now they want to knowtheir kids will get passports in the new independent statethey attend Scottish universities now. It certainly seems that many English people are surprisingly clear-sighted and decisive about independence – either from a “glad to see the back of the whining Jocks” perspective or from an honest acknowledgment that Scots “didn’t vote for this mess”. My guess is that important strands of English opinion have never been sentimental about the Union. It’s just been an arrangement that has now run its course – in the view of prominent players on both sides. South of the Border, the Union has been a calculation, not a calling – however overwrought English politicians sometimes contrive to appear.Former Labour MP Tom Harris told Radio Scotland last weekend that the “hard Left” of his party “always regarded the Union as a colonial construct. That’s why Jeremy Corbyn stayed at home on his allotment when Labour MPs came up in .”Perhaps. In Scotland, though, that colonial construct has been much more than a calculation. It’s been cloaked with sentiment, studded with power and fuelled by the chronic fear of failure that bedevils the disempowered. Thanks to Johnson and Brexit, that cloak is slipping to reveal the intractable problems that blight the once gilded Union path. Opinion here is taking a while to turn, but that’s understandable.Folk are detaching from the authority of Westminster and considering the idea of a new independent country without a blueprint to hand. But make no mistake. Quiet consideration is a crucial part of any change process. A final decision needs a final focus – a deadline. And several are fast approaching. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"25m revamp could see edinburgh tattoo and other big events beamed to princes st gardens","story":"Footage from the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo and major sporting events like Wimbledon, the World Cup, the Six Nations and the Olympics could beamed into Edinburgh#s new open air concert arena in Princes Street Gardens in future.Tattoo organisers have also suggested that regular daytime and evening concerts featuring star performers could be staged once a £ million makeover is complete. The charitable trust leading The Quaich Project has also revealed that live sporting events could also be staged there. Other ideas published on its website include hosting spectacular light shows like The Enchanted Forest in Pitlochry, the staging of “Shakespeare in the Gardens” productions, like those at the Glasgow Botanic Gardens, and even a “Bark in the Park” event for dog-lovers.The Ross Development Trust, which was set up by hotel developer Norman Springford to pursue The Quaich Project, has revealed some of its ambitions ahead of an official planning application next year. The new “world-class” arena would replace an existing concrete bowl, which is currently host a series of Summer Sessions concerts by acts including Lewis Capaldi, Florence and the Machine, Primal Scream and Madness.A global design competition was won two years ago by an American-led consortium after the city council agreed to work with Springford, who has pledged £ million of his own money to try to breathe new le into the gardens as an events arena.Tattoo producer and chief executive Brigadier David Allfrey said: “There is a real opportunity to showcase this extraordinary valley in the middle of Edinburgh with all its history and to make it accessible and very exciting as a cultural and recreational space.“I’m really excited about the project. Shouldn’t we\u2028be streaming the fireworks and the pageantry from the castle straight into the gardens  And perhaps giving small concerts during the daytime or in the evenings and at other times of the year ”Writing on The Quaich Project’s website, managing director David Ellis said it was an opportunity for the gardens to become “a world leader in free to access, public, green spaces.”He added: “I’d love to see some form of live sportappropriate in terms of size and scale or screenings of major sporting events in the gardens. Sport is a great way to bring people together and you would enjoy it with a wonderful backdrop and experience a match-like atmosphere without \u2028having to attend the event in person.”Development director Jules Haston said: “I’d love to see a light display in the gardens – either projected on to the castle or a sound and light display similar to ‘The Enchanted Forest.’ I’d also love the gardens to be open on summer evenings – to bring along a picnic blanket and a bottle of wine for ‘Shakespeare in the Gardens’.”A council spokeswoman said: “The Quaich Project is in its design development stage, building towards a planning application in , and we are all committed to delivering improvements which are supported by the people of Edinburgh. ”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"holyrood told to seek its own foreign policy over europe","story":"Scotland#s foreign policy interests are now #markedly dferent# from the UK government, MSPs have been told. And the Scottish Government should also \u2028be ready to deal with rows with Westminster in certain areas of international affairs in order to “promote Scotland’s interests,” in the post-Brexit landscape, experts have told a Holyrood committee.Priorities such as tackling climate change, driving down emissions, defending a democratic and secure Europe and promoting inclusive growth are among the areas which could be at the heart of future of Scottish-EU relations.Anthony Salamone of the Scottish Centre on European Relations says Scotland should develop a “comprehensive modern European strategy” in a submission to Holyrood’s External Relations committee which is conducting an inquiry into the issue.“In the present political context, the Scottish Government’s European and external affairs policies are markedly dferent from those of the UK Government,” he states.“It is also undeniable that Scotland possesses a distinct identity recognised in Europe and globally. “The Scottish Government will have to navigate current and future disagreements with the UK government on EU and foreign policy, determining the best means of promoting Scotland’s interests.”His colleague, Dr Kirsty Hughes, warns that when the UK finally leaves the EU, this will diminish its influence on the “global stage” and hit Scotland.But she added: “There is still room for Scotland to outline its own European priorities.”EvenBrexit goes ahead, the EU’s policies in areas like climate change, single market regulation and human rights among other areas, will all remain of “central importance” to Scotland, she adds.“But influencing the EU and wider European context should remain central to Scotland whether from inside or outside the EU – and that means working with partnersat all levels.”A European strategy for Scotland would set out clear priority areas which could include climate change, cooperating to create a “democratic and secure” Europe, a more open migration policy and pushing for fair growth, according to Hughes.“Engaging with those wider issues more comprehensively through building a European strategy for Scotland, and placing it at the heart of a wider international strategy, can open out our horizons again and give more weight to all the ways Scottish actors – government, political, business, civil society,cultural and more – continue to engage in Europe and the world.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Is it not time you got over it Alas, Ms Sturgeon#sEU policy is vacuous, unsustainable humbug. If Britain stays in the EU, Scotland will automatically leave on Independence Day, creating an immediate “hard border” with the UK . EU tarfs will apply and trade negotiations will be with Brussels, not Westminster. Our . percent budget deficitexceeds EU limits , implying spending cuts tax hikes of around £ billion per year from a total budget of £- billion.We shall face years of austerity, at the end of which we shall adopt the euro and hand over control of our economy and trade, fishing and agriculture to Brussels. ‘Hasta la vista’, independence!Scots will never vote for that.The obvious antidote is to join EFTA, instead of the EU. But that isn’t the policy being peddled to voters. Ms Sturgeon recently confirmed SNP intentions to rejoin the EU on the BBC#s Andrew Marr Show. The policy is unsustainable humbug and it will change before any independence referendum takes place.The problem is Mr Tulloch is you live in a British mindset when it comes to economics and is very much accepting of the present way of government of Scotland .Proactive governments like Norway, Ireland and Iceland run their government and countries a lot dferent from Westminster and have for example a lot higher g.d.ps or bigger economiesthan we have at the moment, Ireland a hundred years ago was an integral part of the British state ,a rural backwater a neo military junta .Today#s economy an open modern European nation is something to be proud of with a g.d.p of  compared to the U.K  or it#s North east of Ireland of dollars.O the JUSTICE of it.Mr Salmond#s  #Declaration of Lerwick# promised new powers for Shetland. The Smith Commission Reportsubsequently made the following recommendation: #Crown Estate#. Responsibility for the management of the Crown Estate’s economic assets in Scotland, and the revenue generated from these assets, will be transferred to the Scottish Parliament. This will include the Crown Estate’s seabed, urban assets, rural estates, mineral and fishing rights, and the Scottish foreshore for which it is responsible.#. Following this transfer, responsibility for the management of those assets will be further devolved to local authority areas such as Orkney, Shetland, Na h-Eilean Siar or other areas who seek such responsibilities…….#Perhaps, Ms Sturgeon will update us on progress, four years on What a great advert for the SNP!!!!# One of the worst education systems according to the international measurement last published.Nicola Sturgeon, albeit unwittingly, chose to wear a Barbour jacket during her brief visit to Shetland. The ‘Barbour’ brand is the ultimate symbol of being proud to be British worn by celebrities around the world, including our own British Royal Family, and made in South Shields in North East England. Although Nicola’s grandmother did come from Sunderland, so it might have been an unconscious calling from her ancestors. ‘Second Working Man– “Leebralism is – feth I can hardly richtly tell dee what hit is!’“What is Leebralism” A Liberal candidate made it clear on a visit to Shetland.It is being in favour of the freedom of business and the freedom of the inidual, even though these may conflict.The man was standing for the European Parliament back when John Major was PM. He was speaking at an NFU meeting in the Lerwick Hotel.Asked about a Tory threat to the minimum wage protection that was in place for agricultural workers, he said he didn’t hold with a minimum wage workers should be free to accept as low a wage as was offered.Their “freedom” was to be exploited.Back then LibDems opposed Labour’s plan to extend the minimum wage on principle. Something to do with their backing from small businesses.Of course they changed their minds once it was clear it was going to happen.A bit like Tavish backing the right of women to join the Royal and Ancient golf club at St. Andrews, after they’d let them in.So the clash between securing the freedom of iniduals and that of business is resolved by sitting on a fence and waiting for a strong wind.What is Liberalism Whose round is it Another classic cock-up from the SNP!

The results are projects which genuinely improve the lives of today#s residents # as well as visitors # and leave a legacy for future generations. What is even more remarkable is the fact these projects are achieved with very little access to loans. The good work of the community trusts is achieved through dogged determination to raise funds within the community combined with seriously clever navigation of the minefield of grant applications. By steadily securing the funds from a myriad public pots and local activities the trusts ensure each project is not only affordable now, but sustainable for generations to come.In Staffin # home to the iconic Old Man of Storr # the local community trust has raised over £, to upgrade existing footpaths and create new ones. There will be new parking, #welcome# structures and interpretation boards at all sites. The whole project will result in what the trust is calling #Skye Ecomuseum# which will encourage visitors to spend more time and therefore more money in Staffin.In the north west of Skye, the Glendale Trust covers a huge area that attracts , visitors a year # many travelling the long and winding single track road to the top five hotspot of Neist Point.The trust, under the leadership of Tim Hunter-Davies and three new directors, is working hard to develop sustainable facilities for the community and tourists. They have taken ownership of Meanish Pier and the foreshore, creating opportunities for local residents and regional businesses alike. It will be run commercially and provide income to enable the Trust to invest in further sustainable community projects.Glendale # which was the subject of Scotland#s first community buyout back in  # is rich in history and the trust is also looking to develop projects that preserve and share the story of the area, as Tim Hunter-Davies explains: #As well as being instrumental in land reform in the last century, Glendale has a rich heritage stretching back through the centuries. A steamer used to sail daily from Loch Dunvegan and was used as a point to transport many people away from Scotland during the Highland clearances. We want to preserve and share our history with the community and visitors.#In south Skye is the Sleat Community Trust. It has been working hard to provide and improve leline services for the community that also benefit visitors arriving and leaving Skye on the Armadale Mallaig ferry.The SCT currently provides shop, post office and fuel services in two buildings no longer fit for purpose. Over £, has been raised from public and private sources to build a new shop with a community #social# space and offices for the employees of the Trust. They hope to open the new shop in early summer .In addition, the purchase by the Trust of the -hectare Tormore Forest in  continues to create additional sources of income, including selling housing plots as well as an attraction for the community and visitors alike. As trust business development manager Mike Shucksmith explains, the success is based on a combination of commercial and voluntary activity.He said: #To maintain the forest, we have to generate income so we sell split logs to the community, create woodchip for biomass boilers and are developing a micro-hydro scheme. At the same time, we have a vibrant volunteer culture in Sleat who have created a network of paths, social areas and a polytunnel where local school children can help grow saplings to regenerate the forest. The trust also operates #Skyenet # a community broadband network # a community transport scheme, Tormore Explore Forest School and the Visit Sleat tourism group, which promotes the area as a destination of choice for visitors.#From the Sleat Peninsula to the gateway to Skye in the south where a new access route to the island is being created by the members of the Broadford and Strath Community Company. They are developing a cycle path all the way from Kyle of Lochalsh to Broadford. One of the project pioneers is keen local cyclist, Andy Neison.#I used to commute from Teangue on Sleat to Kyle by bike,# he said. #I was really unnerved by the road from Breakish to Kyle with a high volume of fast-moving traffic. When friends told me about the old road from Broadford to Kyle I started exploring sections of it. It#s a good starting point and will become a pioneer project for the highlands.#After receiving a grant of £, from Sustrans, a sustainable transport charity, to fund engineering and traffic surveys, the Trust is now working to secure funding for a project officer to take the Skye Cycleway to the next phase. The community is heavily invested in the project with volunteers coming out in all weathers to clear sections of the old road, but this is a long-term project with hundreds of thousands of pounds ultimately needed to complete the full route from Kyle to Broadford.Over the Skye bridge, the Kyle and Lochalsh Community Trust is creating a vast community and visitor experience on a piece of land known as the Plock.Securing funding from the Scottish Land Fund enabled the Trust to take ownership of the Plock and the old Skye Bridge toll office and develop a masterplan for these two community assets. On the Plock itself, there will be a hub building with cafe, carpark and toilets, a network of accessible paths, a #pitch and putt# course, a Viking living village, accommodation pods, a watersports centre, wildle hide and a for thrill-seekers a huge zipline across the bay.Jo Wawrzyczek of the trust expects the Plock to attract , visitors a year. #This is an ambitious project that will cost almost £million,# she said. #However, it is very important for local people and businesses as it will help to create a great community space as well as keep visitors in our community for longer.#The trust also owns and manages the public toilets and pontoons in Kyle which will be a source of income for the project. With the aim of making the project self-sustaining, the Trust plans to lease the café and watersports centre on the Plock as well as generating income through the accommodation pods. Inspired by the success of other community-driven harbour developments such as Tobermory on Mull, Portree and Braes Community Trust want to maximise opportunities for local people and visitors through taking ownership of the harbour and improving facilities.The trust is currently in talks about relocating the oil tanks at the pier head which would be a breakthrough for the project and open up commercial opportunities. They are also considering a new road from the south to improve access and ert traffic away from the town centre. But according to development officer Fiona Thompson a new breakwater and pontoons will be the real game-changer for Portree.She said: #There have been aspirations for improvements to facilities at the harbour for over  years with little major investment.The harbour group are now closer than ever to realizing the community#s vision for a new, vibrant, welcoming port.

New Bridge Integrated College principal Peter Agnew welcomed the Governments announcement of the junk food ban. He said around  per-cent of pupils use the canteen and added: \"We source our own supplies and in the last year we have introduced a very successful healthy eating programme. \"One example of this is the childrens chip intake having dropped by two-thirds. \"We have found thatyou offer a range of food thats attractively presented and well prepared the children will eat it and given a little bit of time they will become more adventurous.VARIETY \"We had a meeting last week of a group of school bursars and they said they had never been in a school canteen which served such a iety of food.\" Mr Agnew said the school canteen did not serve fizzy drinks and had non-chip days. \"This is something we have initiated ourselves because we are more concerned with the children eating healthy food than engendering funds. \"But providing processed food is cheaper than purchasing and preparing healthy food, which is harder work for canteen staff and those purchasing our supplies. \"The Government would need to put a bit more money into helping schools provide healthy meals.\" of the cheapest airports to fly from in the UK Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BANB | Article Teaser\" St Patricks College principal Donal McCann said he welcomed the junk food ban, but feels it cannot be implemented overnight. \"I think it will have to be a gradual process with a need to educate the children about the benefits of healthy eating,\" he said. \"Having said that we adopted our own healthy eating policy  months ago and removed all vending machines. \"We dont have any fizzy drinks, we have opened a salad bar in the canteen and we are finding that children are interested in eating healthy food. \"Food in the salad bar is made to order, while we also have more traditional school dinners available as well.\"COST Mr McCann said one problem was the extra cost of providing healthy food. \"We have been approached by children asking why we cannot provide the healthy food at the cheaper prices,\" he said. \"But that is not our decision and all we can do is try to use our influence with the Board to seethat can happen. \"Its fair to say that school meals are not funded to the extent they should be.\" Two years ago Banbridge High School became involved in a health promoting schools initiative. At that stage healthy options were provided on the menu and a salad bar was made available. Vice-principal Coralie Currie estimated that a third of pupils who use the canteen take a healthy option. \"Three years ago we also banned fizzy drinks and crisps and the tuck shop sells water and fruit juices. \"There wasnt much opposition to the ban on fizzy drinks and I think children are more aware of the need to eat healthily. \"We dont have any vending machines and what we as a school have to do is encourage children to make better choices.\" Mrs Currie said the school would welcome initiatives to encourage healthy eating, but she did sound one word of caution. \"This has to be a case where the Government comes up with finance to support its proposals. \"A lot more preparation time is involved in providing healthy food and staffing levels in canteens would have to be increased.\""},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"a feast for the eyes at feile st marys exhibition","story":"AN integral part of the annual Féile an Phobail, the visual arts programme continues to attract record numbers through its doors at its base in St Mary’s University College.This year’s programme is packed full of exhibiting artists and groups represented throughout Ireland and worldwide through a range of mediums and topics including paintwork, sculpture and installations.Artists on display range from Aidan Monaghan, Andrew Whitson, Micheál Gallagher, acclaimed music photographer Conor Kerr and David Bell.Féile Operations and Events Co-ordinator Áine McCabe described the week-long event as “one that people don’t want to miss”.“I recently joined Féile, just after Christmas, and it’s been a baptism of fire,” she laughed. “Having been involved with Féile for many years, whether as a participant or volunteer, it’s a completely dferent ball game seeing behind the scenes and what goes in year on year to put the festival on in all its guises.“We have Deirdre Mackel and Micheál Gallagher working for months to bring together the exhibition, to bring together the dferent genres of art and it’s great to see so many repeat artists coming back. It’s really invaluable having Deirdre and Micheál onboard and it was incredible to see so much of an eclectic mix of people at the launch. Art and creativity is very much part of the foundation of Féile.”Aisling Award winner Deirdre Mackel has spent six years at the helm of the visual arts exhibition having previously become involved as an exhibitor. “I have seen the exhibition grow over the years, it’s brilliant to be a part of, to see the amount of people coming in and just taking their time to see the art works,” she said. “It just really warms my heart to see all the art up in St Mary’s.”Deirdre spoke of the amount of preparation that goes into the artistic showcase each year. “There is a lot of background work, the call that goes out for artists to display in the first instance. When you see people coming in and installing their art works it’s just magical. You really get a sense of what it means on launch night which we had last Wednesday, seeing what it means to people, to the artist it lts my spirits. Debuting artists would say ‘I’m so nervous’ and they come back year after year, the exhibition really encourages new artist development and another thing that comes out of it is a real sense of volunteering.”Deirdre continued: “Local artist Micheál Gallagher has also come on board and the team have been very much hands on deck. We have some really stand-out pieces from the West Belfast Arts Society, Richard Kelly and a focal point is always the Relatives for Justice Remembrance Quilt. We have a series of Civil Rights posters which were exhibited in the Tate Modern and now they have been brought to Féile.“We are seeing a lot of the artists coming here with their families and staying for the duration of the festival. The visual arts exhibit gains more and more momentum year on year.” The Féile Visual Arts Exhibition will be on display until Thursday, August .

To play in West Belfast, the atmosphere was really incredible, it was emotional.”Joby said that he is “looking forward” to sharing a stage with all who are on the ‘Greatest Hits’ bill come August .“They are good friends of mine and have all influenced me one way or another over the years, West Belfast is overflowing with talent.”A roadie “lting gear at the back of the Ulster Hall for U and the Horselips”, Joby was heavily influenced by his brother Martin and his mother Mary. “The house always had music in it,” he says.“The night at the Cultúrlann will be informal, I’ll be telling a few stories of some of the songs that I’ve written, telling of my musical adventures from when I was kid. The first song I ever wrote was Belfast when I was . Ten years later we were in the British charts, that song has really resonated with people,” he said.He continued: “I was doing a gig with Iain Archer in the Oh Yeah Centre recently and he told me that Belfast was the song that made him believe that he could have a career in music, it really took me back to hear that from him as he is credited with writing Run with Snow Patrol. He said that Energy Orchard inspired him to get into music. You never know what a song can do for a person.”Joby spoke of how much he is looking forward to getting “those characters” his musical compadres in the one room come the end of the month at the Devenish event.“Rab McCullough’s guitar playing, the energy of Baraka really rubbed off on us. On the sleeve of the first Energy Orchard album we thanked Rab and Malachy McCambridge, the keyboard player, for giving us the blues. Those days up in the Club-house on the Glen Road, they were days we’ll never forget, it was electrying. The angst of the Troubles, that pent up anger everything was exorcised on a weekly basis through Baraka’s performances.“This month is going to be a memorable one, I’m looking forward to seeing Brianon the night at the Devenish who’d be a good friend of mine. It will be a real celebration.”An Evening with Joby Fox takes place on Friday August  in Cultúrlann.

Normal staffing levels at the Northern Ireland Ambulance Servicehave been down % over the weekend.The NIAS has blamed the situation on a number of factors, including increased demands on the service, longer turnaround times at hospital, staff vacancies, rostered annual leave and sickness absence.Voluntary crews from the St John Ambulance and private sector operators in Northern Ireland were also used to help cover call-outs over the weekend. Shortages were again expected on Sunday night.NIAS medical director Dr Nigel Ruddell apologised for delays in services but he insisted critical call-outs had not been impacted.Our staff are tired, they have shown a great deal of dedication throughout this time and we have relied far too long on good will from them providing extra cover through over-time and we recognise thatDr Nigel Ruddell, NIAS medical director“We strive to make sure that is only happening in cases where there is less of an absolutely time-critical need,” he told the BBC on Sunday.“I am not aware of any cases of immediately le threatening problems which have suffered as a result of any signicant delays, because we are prioritising those cases and directing the resources we do have to those over and above the cases which realistically do not have the time-critical element.”He added: “We are recognising the pressures we faced this weekend, we have been looking at all options to increase our cover and that included getting one ambulance into Newry station on Friday night and last night we had an ambulance up in Altnagelvin station and both of those ambulances came from the National Ambulance Service of Ireland and we are very grateful for their support.“Our staff are tired, they have shown a great deal of dedication throughout this time and we have relied far too long on good will from them providing extra cover through over-time and we recognise that.”Dr Ruddell said the NIAS was on a mission to recruit and train new staff, highlighting that proposals had be put to Stormont’s Department of Health designed to address the staffing problems."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland couple create stunning sea of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The businesses in Portglenone are delighted as its brought a lot more people into the town.\"It doesnt take that long to sow the seeds,\" said Damian, who works at the local DLF Seeds company and knows what it takes to bring the field to le. \"It was just a couple of hours of walking up and down shaking the fiddle, but after that its out of your hands as to whether everything comes good.\"This year Damien and Karen, with their three children Cara , Ryanand Therese , have crafted another masterpiece. Visitors are greeted by scenes reminiscent of a Monet impressionist painting with a touch of Van Gogh, all on the edge of Seamus Heaney country.\"We live in a very green country with lots of rolling meadows, but people seem to like a splash of colour too. Its dferent and we like to think its a very romantic setting,\" said Damien. \"We had three marriage proposals in the field last year, wedding parties coming for photographs, plenty of fashion photo shoots, buses stopping off on tours of the country and, of course, plenty of photographers. There were also a couple of music videos filmed.\"The families who have come along are getting back to nature. Its so good that people are getting out into the fresh air and appreciating natural beauty. Kids are running around the path spotting butterflies.\"Thats an added bonus this year, with a neighbour lending an extra acre-sized field where Damian has created the perfect haven for butterflies, and when work commitments allow, he is only too happy to take visitors on a guided walk through the wildflowers.\"Its worked so well,\" he said. \"Were getting plenty of guests! \"Weve seen some of the rarer types, like painted ladies and peacocks. Youd almost think they were looking at you as the patterns on the wings resemble eyes. Its lovely to see them coming into their natural habitat.\"Obviously were relying a lot on the weather, but its been warm enough so far this year to allow the sunflowers to come out. They are a tropical plant, so heavy rain can take its toll, but theyve survived so far andwe can manage to get a couple of decent sunny days, even more of them should come out. Were at around % right now, and they thrive on direct sunlight.\"Karen and her kids, plus an army of young people from the town, have all been roped in to keep the meadow in tip top shape, and she expects the field to be open to the public for the next few weeks.\"Obviously theres a limited time span for when the sunflowers are in bloom, soanyone does want to take a stroll through, forget all about everyday le and lose themselves in a natural world, the next two to three weeks will be the best time to experience it,\" she said.\"In the meantime, were only too happy to have people as our guests, bring a picnic or a flask of tea and enjoy it while it lasts.\"This year, Damien and Karen are raising money for Macmillan Cancer Support. Entry is £ or £ for  to -year-olds. Under s go free.

Some of the features retained in the house include a stone floor that is over  years old and a Royal Mail postbox that dates back to Queen Victorias reign. The unusual detail of the thatched house with its steep roof, eaves gutter and tall chimney is unique in Northern Ireland, according to the Department for Communities.This means the house appears to the passer-by as two dwellings, each with a front door, but it is in fact a single dwelling which for most of the past century has been home to the Maccombe family.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetMurray Maccombeis the third generation of his family to live in the magnicent dwelling, which sits on a three-acre site.Speaking to the Belfast , Mr Maccombe said he has fond memories of the house going back to his early years.He said: \"My grandfather Robert Henry Maccombe bought this house around  and it has been in our family since, but the original owner was a man called Hugh McCullagh.\"At the time my grandfather bought it, it was a farmhouse but also a grocers shop hardware store and it stayed like that until  when he opened a shop separate from the house.\"I have very clear memories of visiting my grandparents and obviously living there when my father Alan took it over.\"My father passed away in  but my mother stayed on, on her own.\"I moved in with my own family in  and I will be sad to leave the house, but really it has outgrown my we and I. \"Our two daughters are away at university and the reality it the house is too large for us to upkeep, especially the gardens, but it will be a great buy for someone.\"The house is being sold for Mr Maccombe by Donnybrook Estate Agents in Derry for offers over £,.Stephen McCarron said he expects that the house will attract a lot of interest.He said: \"We are delighted to have this magnicent property on our books for sale and there has been interest shown already from people in the UK and further afield. \"It is a property steeped in history but also comes with so much potential for development and I am optimistic it will have a new owner before long.\"Further details and an appointment to view can be arranged through Donnybrook Estate Agents on   "},{"url":null,"title":"revealed five schools share the top spot in gcse league table results","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The service operates seven days a week for  hours per day.Serious or le-threatening situations can happen to anyone at any time and on average, every single day in Northern Ireland, one inidual finds themselves in desperate need of AANI.In April of this year, the Derry News reported that the Air Ambulance was deployed to a factory in the Strathfoyle area of the city where a male employee was involved in an “industrial incident”.Speaking about the second anniversary, Kerry Anderson, Head of Fundraising for AANI said: “Each time the helicopter lts off we are aware that someone is in great need and that, thanks to the generosity of people locally, the HEMS team can offer the best chance of saving a le.“The air ambulance is there for any one of us and might one day save your le or that of a loved one.

Derry motocross racer is one of many patients who are grateful for the rapid response of the Air Ambulance.Eoghan Kerlin from Dungiven was taking part in a quad motocross event in Cookstown in September  when he required medical assistance. He was out on the track and unfortunately went over a jump at the same time as another competitor and collided at speed.Eoghan came off his quad in the air, landing on his right-hand side as he attempted to clear the jump. His we Kerrie, who was at the event, immediately rang .Due to the nature of this incident and the high index of suspicion for potential injuries, the air desk paramedic who was monitoring this call spoke directly with Kerrie to gain further information. The air desk paramedic dispatched the air ambulance on the knowledge that Eoghan was badly injured and required immediate pre-hospital critical care interventions.A road ambulance was deployed and arrived shortly before the air ambulance. Eoghan had a seizure and was sedated by the HEMS team at the scene before being transferred by the air ambulance to Royal Victoria Hospital.The Dungiven man’s injuries were all down the right side and he had an open fracture in his leg, his femur was shattered, and he had broken ribs and a bruised lung.Speaking about the accident, Eoghan’s we Kerrie said: “Standing on the side-lines and watching the accident was one of the worst moments I’ve ever experience, I really thought Eoghan was going to die.“Eoghan had a seizure at the scene which was incredibly frightening but when I saw the air ambulance coming into land my anxiety reduced. Within minutes of the HEMS team arriving, all the craziness seemed to calm, and I just felt so much more at easy as the team were so professional.”As part of his recovery, Eoghan visited the air ambulance base, and the home of the Air Ambulance Northern Irelandcharity, in Lisburn to meet the team who had helped him.He updated them on his recovery, saying: “I’m still undergoing treatment for my injuries and will have to have surgery on my kneecap which has unfortunately been damaged beyond repair. But I’m here and I’m on the road to recovery and every week there is further improvement.“I owe a great deal to all of the medical professionals who helped, and continue to help, me and I’m feeling positive about the future.”Kerrie added: “As a family, we know just how important the air ambulance service is and in recognition of this, we held a fundraiser in November last year and raised £, for the charity.

And, a charity called Think Pacic provided the young woman with the vehicle to fulfil her ambition.“I’ve always wanted to go away to help people, because my degree involves quite a degree of caring for people. One of my friends at university did it last year, so I spoke to him about it and then we had a talk about at university and I looked at the Think Pacic website as well. Then I had a phone interview and got accepted for it.“After I was accepted into the programme, I just read up on it and became more interested in doing something,” Orlaith said.Think Pacic allows volunteers to sample le at the heart of remote Fijian villages far removed from what normally passes as backpacking trips in students gap years. Each team of volunteers stays in a dferent community and they are immersed into every aspect of the le of the country’s customs, values and traditions.“We had a welcome ceremony when we entered the village and were given a traditional Fijian drink called Kava. It’s a sedative drink derived from the pepper plant and it’s used for ceremonial occasions.“The Fijian’s believe in sharing everything so no one ever goes without. They are a very traditional people and we had to dress very modestly so as not to show any disrespect. Our shoulders had to be covered and we had to wear long dresses called Bula dresses and skirts called Sulu’s,” Orlaith continued.The charity was founded in the early s and adopts a bespoke approach to its volunteer work in the South Pacic country. Often, teams of volunteers are the first top have ever worked in the communities they visit because the trips only take placea Fijian community agrees to invite them there in the first place. Rather than focussing on just a single school or location it means that Think Pacic can reach thousands of children each year and spread the message of education, sport and health.This model means that the overall project is sustainable, especially as volunteers train local leaders to carry on the work after they have departed. It’s also a programme that has been fully embraced by the Fijian Government.Orlaith, a former student at Lumen Christi says that Think Pacic have taken specic steps to avoid what’s become known as ‘voluntourism’. The term refers to the growing phenomenon of iniduals travelling to developing countries to carry out volunteer work. Recently, there have been increasing concerns about voluntourism and in particular gap year projects that some have suggested that can cause more harm than good to host communities.Primary concerns are that some charitable organisations are running volunteering trips along business lines and can result in the institutionalisation of children.Orlaith Duffy’s month long stay in Fiji was on the country’s main island Viti Levu at Muanaira village- a remote rural setting around two hours from the national capital Suva.Orlaith told the Derry News: “Think Pacic have moved away from voluntourism because they know that a lot of organisations take students money and students are staying in hotels and then spending a small amount of time helping people.“So, it’s a bit contradictory. Think Pacic want you to live with villagers then every day from am until pm we would go to the school. We would teach from am until pm they do sports in the afternoon.”In fact, teaching in the in the village school where the pupil’s age range runs from six to -years of age is a vital component of the volunteering workOrlaith continued: “Think Pacic have dferent key learning aims. Schooling in Fiji is very basic, so I noticed that children at the same age over they compared to our own children here had very dferent levels of education.“Their education is so far behind because teachers just don’t have enough time or resources to focus on the children that are falling behind. We would have sat in the classroom and noticedthere were particular children falling behind. Then we would take them out and do one on one’s with them. We tried to strip it back to basics and do basic maths with them before moving on to the more dficult stuff that they were getting taught in class.“We also did a lot of letter phonics with their sounds and their grammar because sometimes they didn’t understand why certain words were put in front of other words and sentences. And we did a lot of work with past and present tenses because they weren’t sure about that either. We got to choose what age group we wanted to work with as well so the one on one sessions would have been with primary one’s up until primary sevens. So, I chose ‘kindi’, like nursey, which was five-year-olds. They were learning their alphabet and numbers and arts and crafts. We did a dferent letter with them each day. They would practice how to draw the letter and practice their numbers.”In the classroom the children are expected to converse in English-something which presents another educational challenge.Three main languages are used in Fiji-English, Fijian and Fijian Hindi. Fijian is spoken by most indigenous Fijians who account for almost  per cent of the country’s population. Fijian’s of Indian descent make up another  per cent of the population and mainly speak Fijian Hindi.The English language is a remnant of British colonial rule and was the sole official language until . English is widely used in government, business and education circles, but business is also widely carried out in Fijian, especially in rural areas.A small number of other Indigenous West Fijian and East Fijian regional languages are spoken on the islands, standard Fijian belonging to the East Fijian group. Chinese and Rotuman are also spoken by immigrant populations.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshOrlaith said: “In school it’s all English. The younger children find it more dficult and the teacher would speak Fijian to the nursery children-so half in English, half in Fijian. But everything  is done in English.”Viti Levu is the largest island in the Republic of Fiji and is home to  per cent of the entire population-around , people. The island is just over  miles long and  miles wide. Its rugged terrain is explained by the fact that it was created largely as a result of earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.Territorially, the island is ided into roughly equal halves by a mountain range running from north to south. The island’s centre is covered by forest and is dominated by Fiji’s highest mountain-Mount Tomanivi which stands at , feet.The eastern side of the island experiences heavy rainfall, while the western side, also called the \"burning west\" is noticeably drier in the ranges rain shadow. Similarly, sugar cane production thrives in the west, while a dairy industry is being built in the east. Fijis biggest cattle ranch is at Yaqara, with  head of cattle on its , acres.Orlaith Duffy said: “Living with the villagers gave us a better idea of the culture. Living standards are very basic-a lot of mornings there would be no running water to wash or brush teeth. The water pressure was a lot better at night. The houses only had a single tap so the man of the house would spend time filling a lot of buckets with water so that would be used for cooking. The shower we had was a bucket with holes in it, so we just used that to wash ourselves.“In Fiji as well, the diet is very carb heavy and very sugar heavy. There’s a need to encourage children to brush their teeth so we took toothpaste and toothbrushes out there. The school I went to was already quite well developed in that way so that was good to see.“There was a man in our village and because he had severe diabetes he had to have his leg amputated. So, we carried out a health workshop and spoke about strokes and heart attacks and how to spot the signs, prevent them and what to doyou see someone taken one. We also did basic teaching on how to clean cuts and not to leave them exposed. We left first aid kits behind in the village as well.Like the domestic dwellings Orlaith said that the school buildings were also basic consisting of concrete and corrugated roofs.“If there isn’t enough room to accommodate all of the children they would add on a couple of Portacabins.“Some of the villages are remote, so people make their living from fishing. But where I stayed, because it was around two hours from the capital, I noticed that a lot of the Fijian’s who are my age where at university. When we lived with a family, we referred to the parents as our mum and dad.“My Fijian dad was in the military, so it was interesting to talk to him because he was very well travelled. The mum has a degree in accounting, but she has given it up because she’s looking after the children. But, a lot of the islanders don’t work at all because they were the ones that fell behind at school.“Luckily, our school was only a  minute walk from the village but I know that other school’s are about  minutes or an hour’s trek every day. I also noticed that sometimes the children just aren’t encouraged to go to school by their parents because some of them would have just stayed in the village during the day. I think us being there did make attendance better and the teacher noticed that the behaviour was a lot better too,” said Orlaith.The Derry News put it to Orlaith that she could have easily spent her summer backpacking in the region as opposed to volunteering-so why did she become involved “I just thought whenever I was reading on it that it made feel how lucky I was to come from here and because Cardf University gave us the chance to go and do something-I just really wanted to help then.“Some of my friends went to Africa this summer to test eyes, but I couldn’t do that because they are a year ahead of me in their studies. When I looked into Think Pacic I thought that it would be a good idea and I can always go back thereI want to because now that I’ve volunteered there will be an opportunity to go back as a leader next year.“So, I could lead a group of people that were in my position this year. Then you can go on to be a project manager and oversee a few dferent teams.“When I got there at the start I thought ‘what am I doing here on the other side of the world ’ There was no Wi-Fi, barely any signal to call home. I actually bought a ‘brick’ phone so I could call home, but it was very limited, I had to stand in certain parts of the area to get a signal.“But, once I settled in that you saw how rewarding this was because the children improved each day and the people are so friendly. They have nothing, but they never complain or never in a bad mood. The people are very community based soI was walking through the village at night dferent families would be calling me in to eat dinner with them.“It was very rare for my and my family to be eating dinner alone because there was always loads of other people in our house eating with us because they invite everyone in. Even when we were getting a bus to the village,you shout ‘bula’ that means hello, but it also means ‘be given le’.“Everyone says hello to everyone . I thought it was quite similar to home because we say hello when we walk past someone in the street, but at university in Cardf people don’t do that. They put their heads down and walk on. I found that the Fijians are quite similar to Irish people because home and family are close to them, but they take it to the next level by inviting everyone it and checking how people are.”Anyone wishing to volunteer for Think Pacic must be between the ages of -.

Harry Hitchins got the prize wicket of first team captain Ian Wright.The golden oldies rolled back the years in reply with Rodney Hassardshowing his undoubted class in his first game in five years.Woodruff made , including two big sixes off Cameron and Shilliday danced his way down the wicket, as used to be the norm, for a quick fire . Oldroydand Yeatescompleted the job with five wickets to spare.The second game saw some excellent ball striking and decent bowling from an NCU Select team.Saintfieldrsquos Byron Woodruff and the best young prospect in County Down,  year-old Adam Reid, treated all the bowlers with contempt as the runs flowed quicker than the refreshments.Man of the match Reid hit  not out in only  balls including eight boundaries and one massive six that went out of the ground.Superb all rounder Woodruff showed his old team-mates what a talent he is, hitting  in  balls with four big sixes and the same in boundaries.If both had not retired they would have scored centuries and the Dundrum bowlers were happy to clap them off. Ricky Owens then rolled back the years with a splendid , including three big sixes and three fours, the NCU side posting .It was perhaps fitting that Alan Mills, the oldest player on the pitch and still ultra competitive, finished  not out.Dundrum fought back well after the early onslaught with good fielding catching and astute field placing by captain Gavin McNerlin.Wickets were shared around with Chandar Shekhar the pick of the bowlers, taking  for  of three overs. Shilliday was again on the money and finished with  for .

The long term plans for the , sq ft red brick building involve the setting up of an industrial estate with potential for several hundred jobs. The firm will advertise shortly for tenants and the spokesman explained that there was a real need for small factory premises providing employment in the area.The story of the mill since it closed down when owned by Hurstrsquos as part of the Ulster Weaving Group, when at one stage it provided work for  people, has been a long saga of disappointment.The mill was sold to Irish Waste for around pound, recently. This figure falls far short of the original asking price at a public auction held in Ballynahinch last year, which was believed to be around pound,.The news of employment hopes for Drumaness was welcomed by the chairman of Down Council, Mr Eddie McVeigh, who said it was ldquogood news indeed.He added: ldquoI would welcome anything which would bring jobs to the Drumaness area and I hope that this is not one of the many disappointments which we have suffered over the last few years.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Plessey Telecommunications in Ballynahinch was closed on Monday when more than  production workers walked out as part of a national campaign to obtain shorter hours and more pay.The strike action will be repeated on the Monday of the next two weeks and the production workers are also refusing to work overtime.Their demands are for a basic skilled rate of pound, a reduction in hours to an eventual  hours a week and two extra daysrsquo holiday.A spokesman for the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said: ldquoWe would have prefer to have obtained our realistic claim by mutual agreement with the employers, but unfortunately we are left with no other alternative.STRANGFORD LOUGH mdash A strong plea is being made to boat owners on Strangford Lough to combat the nuisance caused by inexperienced owners of large fast powerboats.It comes from Mr T W McKee, of Sketrick Island, a noted yachtsman with more than  yearsrsquo sailing experience behind him.He is annoyed by a recent ldquomafia-type display of outrageous aggressiveness by a powerboat owner and would like to find an authority with the power to control such ldquoblatant abuse of delightful waters, not to mention the risk to innocent people and their boats by sea-borne thugs.In a letter to the Recorder, Mr McKee describes how his -foot yacht was rocked from side to wide so viciously by the wash of the powerboat, which buzzed around it, that his family and grandchildren were lucky not to be seriously injured as they were flung back and forth across the wheelhouse.He has passed the complaint to the Coastguard in the hope that they can have action taken, but understanding that use of Strangford Lough as a navigable waterway is free to all who wish to use it, he does not expect any success.PORTAFERRY mdash A public meeting is to be held in Portaferry next week to protest about plans for sewage disposal in the town.The meeting has been called by the local development association, which is concerned that the scheme about to be launched will be inadequate.Councillor Paddy Doherty, a member of the development association, appealed for the support of townspeople to support the meeting so that plans can be drawn up to combat the scheme by Ards Borough Council.Mr Doherty said the council originally proposed a filter bed scheme, which would pump treated sewage into Strangford Lough, but then abandoned the filter bed idea.LOUGHINISLAND mdash It was a historic day for the community in Loughinisland when Paddy McFlynn, the president of the GAA, declared open their new Macartan Park on Sunday.The weather certainly could have been kinder for the biggest day in the history of the club, but nevertheless there was a good crowd to witness the opening, as well as the football and hurling games.Mr Vincent Doran, the chairman of the club, welcomed the distinguished guests and said Loughinisland was one of the oldest clubs in East Down.

A few weeks ago Clonduff would have been regarded as red hot favourites to progress against their Division  opponents.However, it is uncertainthe Hilltown outfit will be at full strength as several of their players headed off to the USA a fortnight ago.Clonduff were beaten - to - on Friday night by Burren and given half a chance, Pat Havern and Daniel McCarthy could take full advantage of Clonduffrsquos misfortunes and lead Saval to a surprise win.The curtain-raiser for this game is the IFC encounter between Drumaness and Glasdrumman at .pm. Drumaness are expected to progress as the Quarter Road outfit have yet to win a game this season and seem certain to be relegated from Division .A Gary Murdock-inspired Drumaness beat Glasdrumman - to - at the start of July and they will be intent on repeating that result.There are two IFC games also down for decision over at Fontenoy Park when Drumgath face Darragh Cross and Teconnaught clash with St Johnrsquos.Darragh have been involved in a tense battle for promotion into the top flight, but recent defeats to Carryduff and Longstone have dented their aspirations.However, they are a championship team and in Shane Murray, Michael Monan, Joe McKinney, Matty Hardy and Anton McGrattan they have players capable of going all the way this year and Drumgath, who lie in second place in Division , will do well to get a result.The Teconnaught v St Johnrsquos derby should be a nice opener for the Drumnaquoile side who are more than holding their own in Division  with John Clarke, Conor Morgan, Marty Keenan and the Flanagans all in good form.Teconnaught, who won the JFC title last season, will rely on Paddy Grant, Jack Larkin, Ciaran Carville, David Kelly and Tony Davis to keep them competitive.Friday night sees another four games take place mdash two in Burren and two in Newcastle.A lot of focus will naturally fall on the SFC game between Kilcoo and An Riocht in Burren.Kilcoo have made no secret of the fact that they are determined to regain the Frank OrsquoHare Cup after losing out to Burren in last yearrsquos decider.They have blooded several new faces this season and are well in the running for the ACFL Division  crown, but they will not be taking An Riocht lightly, despite theirindferent season in Division . The Branagan, Devlin, Laverty and Johnston brothers will ensure Kilcoo go into the game in the right frame of mind.At the same venue, Shamrocks clash with Tullylish with the outcome hard to predict.Tullylish have fallen from grace in recent months and have been cast adrt at the bottom of Division . Shamrocks are in the top half of Division , but it looks asthey have missed out on promotion yet again.The game of the night should be in Newcastle where Carryduff lock horns with Castlewellan in the SFC.D J Morganrsquos Carryduff side seem destined for Division , while Castlewellan are battling to avoid relegation to Division .Carryduff have really made their mark this season with James and Daniel Guinness, Owen McCabe, Ronan Beatty, John McGeogh and Josh Connery all to the fore.Castlewellan are just now starting to get a few of their walking wounded back in action and Sean Dornan, Liam, Donal and Gareth McKibbin, Colly Flanagan, Rory Burns and Daniel Morgan could prove a handful for a young Carryduff side.The curtain-raiser to this game is the IFC encounter between Annaclone and Atticall.Ciaran Branniganrsquos Annaclone have been blazing a trail of glory at the top of Division  and it is unlikely that Atticall, who are  points behind them in the table, will inflict their first defeat of the season on them.Annaclone were held to a - to - draw by a fast-improving Ballymartin side on Friday night, but they still should have too much firepower for Atticall.Saturday sees another four games take place.Top billing goes to the Loughinisland v Longstone SFC clash in Castlewellan.Loughinisland have taken Division  by storm since theirthis season and are riding high in third place after Friday nightrsquos - to - win over a good Warrenpoint offering at Macartan Park.Longstone, on the other hand, are embroiled with Carryduff for an automatic promotion place at the top of Division  and now that Ambrose Rogers and Mark Poland are back to full fitness, this should be a cracking affair.Absolutely nothing separated the sides when they met in Division  last year and the same should be the case on Saturday.Loughinisland will rely on their big hitters Dan Gordon mdash still good enough to be playing county football mdash Jonny Flynn, Rory Mason, Stefan Mason and the McClements brothers and they should progress.This game will be proceeded by the Saul v Bosco IFC encounter.Saul,they can reproduce the sort of form they showed a fortnight ago to beat Carryduff, will be expected to ease past their Division  opponents, but championship football doesnrsquot always work that way.Bosco fell to a narrow - to - defeat away to Clann na Banna on Friday night while Saul were soundly beaten - to - by Bredagh.However, Donnan Ritchie will have his charges pumped up for this encounter with the Arnold, Harney and Mahoney brothers prepared to take the game to Bosco.It will be a short trip down the road to Kilcoo for the next two games on Saturday.Glenn play Liatroim in the IFC at .pm and Bryansford take on Bredagh.Neither Glenn or Bredagh have been causing a stir this season, but now is the time to turn it on. Liatroim should be at full strength with the McCrickard connections finally finished with their county hurling commitments and the Fontenoys might just cause an upset.The big game on Saturday night is the Bryansford v Bredagh game in the SFC.Bryansford have been plagued by injuries to key players all season long, but in Davy McKibben, Ruairi Wells, Danny Savage and Conor Maginn they have the men for all jobs and I would expect them to see off Bredagh.Brendan Masonrsquos outfit hammered Saul on Friday night and in Donal Hughes, Tommy McElroy, Eoin Costello and Conor Francis they have players capable of mixing it with the best, but last yearrsquos IFC winners might find Bryansfordrsquos physicality too much to handle.There are another three games to be played on Sunday.Ballymartin face Clann na Banna in the IFC at Mayobridge at pm before Warrenpoint take on Ballyholland and Burren lock horns with neighbours Mayobridge at Pairc Esler.Ballymartin seem to have turned the corner after a few disappointing results, but they are now operating at full strength again and warmed up for the championship with a draw against runaway Division  leaders Annaclone on Friday night.Clann na Banna are sitting in a comfortable mid-table position, but I donrsquot think they will give Ballymartin too much to worry about.The Ballyholland v Warrenpoint game should be another close encounter.Ballyholland may lie bottom of the Division  table, but Warrenpoint are only four points above them. The lsquoPoint have potential match winners in the Boyles and Ross McGarry with Ballyholland looking to the Murphy brothers, Tiarnan Rushe and Seamus Loughran.The Mayobridge v Burrren game is the tie of the round.Paddy OrsquoRourkersquos side, the defending league champions and Frank OrsquoHare Cup holders, will not relinquish their grip on both trophies without a fight.They have been a little bit inconsistent of late, but bounced back to their best on Friday night with a comfortable - to - victory away to Clonduff, while Mayobridge were beaten - to - by Kilcoo.In Kevin McKernan, Donal OrsquoHare, Liam Kerr and the McAvoy brothers, Burren have the perfect blend of youth and experience, while Maybridge will look to Corey Quinn, Shane Annett and the combative Conor Garvey to keep them interested.Downpatrick and Rostrevor bring the curtain down on the first round of fixtures when they clash in Hilltown on Monday night.The sides met last Friday night in the league at Petit Park with Rostrevor winning - to -. However, Caolan Mooney, who was literally unplayable in that game, is unable to play in the championship and that could well hand the initiative to the Hoops.Downpatrick will again look to big performances from their big game players and they donrsquot come any bigger than Gerard Colllins, Michael Magee, Conor McGrady, Jarlath Branagan and the Turley brothers.Without Mooney, Pete McGrathrsquos side will look to Conor Doyle, John Connolly, Shan Parr and Piras Kane for inspiration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Great turnout for multi cultural event in Ballynahinch  ","story":"HUNDREDS of people attended the multi-cultural family friendly celebration at The Square in Ballynahinch on Saturday.The Connecting Cultures Event was held to help promote community cohesion and encourage acceptance and understanding of other cultures.In addition to music from all over the world, there were dancers entertaining the crowd, face painting, an exotic petting farm, stilt walkers, circus skills and cuisine from ious parts of the world.The African drumming proved particularly popular, with people of all ages keen to take part.

Paddy Harte took up the reins of the International Fund for Ireland in March.His chairmanship has come at a challenging time with devolved government in Northern Ireland collapsed, Brexit and violence on the streets including the murder of journalist Lyra McKee.Mr Harte paid tribute to communities as the great unsung hero of Northern Ireland’s peace process..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button But he warned too much is now being expected of them.“The resilience which is there in communities has made peace possible but we are expecting too much of communities now,” he said.“We expect they can not have the Assembly, they can spend loads of time talking about Brexit, cross their fingers and say well communities have stayed in place so far, it’s just a huge thing to expect of communities,” he said.“A lot of progress has been made by communities however they can only take that so far, you cannot have a healthy prosperous society without a ing democracy, that’s just a fact of le.”Mr Harte described some of the work the IFI funds as erting young people away from paramilitary groups.“One of the projects we fund targets hard-to-reach young people, young people who are vulnerable to recruitment by dissidents,” he said.“Our programme is very targeted, our mentors will literally – with the permission of parents or s – go to the bedroom door to say, ‘I would like you to come to our course today’.“If they don’t turn up that day, they’ll go back the next day and persist until they get the young people on the programme so they can then begin to get skills that will get them into employment eventually, build up their personal resilience, expose them to other cultures, expose them to the adverse consequences of violent conflict.“You can see from the bomb on Bishop Street in Derry and the Lyra McKee murder that its very easy to get young people who are vulnerable involved and once they are involved, the consequences then begin to appear for people.Attempted murder inquiry launched after man shot in LutonKettering bingo hall given special community status Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“There is no point in saying we run those programmes, you have to actively go and talk to the young person until you can get them confident enough to actually go into a room where there are other people doing the course.”Mr Harte grew up in Donegal where his father Paddy served as a Fine Gael TD and also founded the Island of Ireland Peace Park in Messines.“I’ve been either actively involved or an observer to peace building since I was quite young,” he said.“That gives me a personal passion to make sure that we continue to work on our relationships on both sides of the border and not allow Brexit or anything  to get in the way. Ultimately how people relate to each other on a human level is far more important.”He recalls the border going back to the s, through the Troubles to quieter times, but now he said it is back in conversations because of Brexit.“Whenever Nancy Pelosi’s delegation was over in April, one of the Congressmen asked me where is the border, I said ‘actually I don’t know’, I know within  yards probably,” he said.“It’s regrettable those conversations are back and people are imagining borders that may never happen. But once people start imagining things, then they extrapolate that into events and that’s the danger. That’s the big danger.”Mr Harte said the fund is at the beginning of a new strategy for the “post Brexit era”.“Whatever way Brexit lands, the whole concept of Brexit has rekindled old wounds, fear of identity, threats to culture, and the border and that’s going to be a big issue for some time to come,” he said.“I seem to have ended up in a particular place at a particular time, a border person ends up at the head of the fund when the border becomes an issue again.”Mr Harte was speaking as the IFI announced its latest funding allocation, investing £,, E,, into nine projects, which are working with the most polarised communities.try catch  TrendingMankilled in two vehicle road traffic collision - two other men hospitalised killed in two vehicle road traffic collision - two other men hospitalised\"N.I.

I didn’t know who I was, what I wanted and questioned everything about my le,” she said. After a failed suicide attempt, the Gortin woman woke up in hospital with her family by her bedside.It was in that moment that she realised just how sick she was and was determined to piece her le back together.“I had a young family who needed me, I didn’t want to die,” she told the News Letter.While she had some input from the mental services as an inpatient, Kelly said she was discharged from hospital with no follow up. “I felt like I was entirely on my own and was determined to get better,” she said.Desperate to get her le back on track, Kelly turned to the freedom of the great outdoors.“Hiking became my therapy,” she explained. “I remember climbing mount Errigal for a charity event and how much freedom I felt from it and so I dragged myself up the mountains, as much as I possibly could, I would go exploring and it was here that I finally felt free.Leo Varadkar: I would be happy to see Orange Order parade in DublinAlmost half of all working age stroke survivors facing financial woes, report shows Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“The mountains asked nothing of me, they stood strong while I tried to figure my le out. I slowly started getting stronger, I pieced my le back to together, one step, one day and one mountain at a time.” Then again six months ago, she felt her health dipping again. Those familiar feelings of depression and isolation came creeping back, and it terried her. She added: “I knew I may not be as lucky to survive a second time, there is a fine line between wanting to live and wanting to die when you are in that dark place and so I reached out for help very quickly. “Turning to family and friends, I opened up about my struggles. And I turned to the one thing that helped me the most, hiking. Again the mental health service had little input, with over a year waiting list to see any therapist, it was up to me to help myself.”She hiked whenever she could it was the only thing that quietened her mind.And it was on the mountains that she started to think of other women who had gone through similar struggles.“There must be other ladies out there, feeling lost, isolated and questioning themselves,” Kelly continued.“If I could reach them somehow, and bring them with me hiking, let them know there is hope and they are not alone, to share my experiences and what helped me.”Skip ahead two years and Kelly has completely turned her le around from those dark days when she felt hopeless. She has even started up her own Facebook group, ‘Soul Girls Adventure’ to allow other women to join her on her journey. “The human species thrives with being in a tribe, and so I created my own tribe, an adventure group for women, where together we are stronger in numbers,” Kelly said. “We hike, meditate and practice yoga. We support and encourage each other, we build each other up and make friends along the way.“For a few hours, I’m helping them make their escape, to not feel alone, and have lots of fun along the way. I want to create a movement of women, enjoying the great outdoors, where we look out for each other and our mental health.” The group has hiked all over, including Donegal, the Sperrins, and the Mournes and have some great adventures coming up, such as the Slieve League clfs, a sunset hike with prosecco overlooking Binevenagh, and a hike and yoga in Fermanagh. Kelly concluded: “Watching friendships grow is incredible.

I would be happy to see Orangemen being able to express their cultural identity in Dublin through a marchthey wanted to do so and that’s something that I would certainly respect.”Referring to the Orange Order’s strong links to Dublin and Sir Edward Carson having been born in the city, Mr Varadkar said: “There would have been a lot of Orange lodges in Dublin and Wicklow at a time – and all over the country – sowe’re serious about respecting each other’s identities, each other’s valueswe’re serious about parity of esteem, it’s not the sort of thing you can pick and choose.”The Orange Order has an annual parade in the Co Donegal village of RossnowlaghSeven years ago, during a ground-breaking speech to the Seanad, the then Orange grand secretary Drew Nelson said that Orangemen in the Republic would love to parade in their capital city, although he said that the institution recognised the “challenges” that may pose.The Fianna Fail leader in the Seanad, Darragh O’Brien, responded that he would like to see a day when there could be an Orange Order parade in Dublin “in a non-triumphalist way”.Mr Nelson, whose speech was greeted with warm applause, told senators: “In the Republic we have about  parades each year. For the reasons, which we all understand, these parades have been pushed to the margins of society.“There has not been an Orange Order parade in a major town in the Republic since before the Troubles. There was one planned in Dublin a few years ago but it was unable to proceed.“Our members in the Republic would welcome the opportunity to hold a parade in their capital city. As an institution we completely understand, however, the challenges which such a parade would pose.”However, in response to the taoiseach’s support for a Dublin parade, Mr Nelson’s successor as grand secretary, the Rev Mervyn Gibson, last night sounded more cautious.He said: “The Orange brethren who reside in the Republic of Ireland, as Leo Varadkar points out, parade in Rossnowlagh each year. They currently have no plans for a parade in Dublin.How embracing the great outdoors pulled Kelly back from the brink of despair Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“There needs to be a purpose to any planned parade – such as a commemoration, celebration or parading to a church service. The Orange Institution does not simply parade for the sake of it.”And, although some Dublin Orangemen want to parade through central Dublin, not all agree.Chris Thackaberry, a middle-aged Dublin Orangeman who travels to Belfast to march on the Twelfth, told the News Letter that Orangeism was about more than simply “a parading culture”.Emphasising that he was speaking in a personal capacity, he said: “As a Dublin Orangeman, I have no interest in parading in my city. Because of our county structure, Co Cavan and the wider border counties have made no move in that direction.“Furthermore the focus for Dublin Orangemen is in highlighting the Orange heritage that can be found in the roots of Irish society through the arts and politics.”He added: “As Dublin Orangemen and custodians of Orange heritage in the city and the Republic we get no support from state bodies ... this week is heritage week – what better opportunity to have our hall opened for view and discussion “But no interest from the city council. If the taoiseach and his government really wanted to involve and engage Orange heritage then they would engage it at ground level.”try catch  TrendingMankilled in two vehicle road traffic collision - two other men hospitalised killed in two vehicle road traffic collision - two other men hospitalised\"N.I.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This, coupled with the feedback from the schoolchildren we work with through our community outreach programme, was enough for us to want to do something about it.ldquoWhatrsquos a girl to do follows Ellie as she sets out on her quest to be an engineer ndash but the road isnrsquot easy. Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

The paper, which examines the negative impact of a ‘no deal’ EU exit, warns the “Northern Ireland Civil Service’s assessment remains that a ‘no deal’ would have a profound and long-lasting impact on NI’s economy and society”. Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says. Once again, it raises serious concerns over the agri-sector in particular, meat in particular, and beef especially, in regards to “increased vulnerability to low cost non-EU imports in the GB or NI market”. Its not just the physical goods, though as it says Northern Irelands IT sector is facing the cost of exporting services increasing, by an average of .%. And regarding foreign direct investment– one of the big business buzzwords here over the last few years – it says “under a ‘no deal’ exit, NI’s FDI attractiveness would be negatively impacted”. “A ‘no deal’ would see losses in the medium to long run of % per annum in the case of the number of FDI projects and of .% for FDI-related new jobs.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/hamilton_hotel.jpg","title":"new  bedroom hotel for titanic quarter","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by John Mulgrew Belfast looks set to get a new -bedroom hotel amid freshly submitted plans for a development across from Titanic Belfast.

While an operator for the hotel has not yet been announced, the group has developed a series of Holiday Inn hotels across the UK and Ireland, as well as Seraphine hotels.

Planning permission has previously been granted for a similar hotel at the site. The hotel is being designed by Belfast architects RMI Architects, and is planned to open in the summer of . Speaking earlier this year, Brian Kelly, a director at the project’s planning consultants, Turley said: “As part of the master-planning team for Titanic Quarter, Turley is very excited to be part of this exciting project. We are delighted that a leading UK hotel developer has chosen Titanic Quarter as its first location in Northern Ireland. “This major investment will support the area’s successful evolution into a world-class tourism destination, an international exhibition and conferencing location and a hub of local, national and international business and education.” And a spokesman for JMK Group said the project is “about making a strategic investment in Belfast’s tourism sector, meeting the increasing demand from families who see Belfast and Titanic Quarter as a family friendly destination”. “We believe that the growth of the tourist sector in Belfast and Northern Ireland has an exciting future.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/twitter.jpg","title":"ulster business top  northern ireland companies  to be unveiled","story":"Posted on Monday  July  by Ulster Business The Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list for  is almost upon us.

A statement, signed by  business organisations and trade bodies, says that “two and a half years on from the collapse of the Executive, and now approaching the likely conclusion of the Brexit process, the Northern Ireland business community is deeply concerned at the continued absence of a ing administration and is calling on political representatives to redouble their efforts to reach agreement to get the Assembly and Executive working again”. “There has seldom been a time when strong and effective leadership has been more necessary, both to deliver on the domestic agenda and also to speak up for Northern Ireland in the Brexit process. “We need a fully ing administration to agree and deliver a Programme for Government that will build infrastructure, reform our health service and education system, ensure we have a strong economy, and create opportunities for our young people. We also need effective representation in the Brexit discussions, even at this late stage in the process, to ensure that the economy is protected through whatever changes arise and that all necessary mitigations are sought and secured. “The business community will give encouragement and support to those politicians who stretch themselves to reach a compromise. Without such a commitment and associated action from our elected representatives, we risk irreparable damage to our economy and our society for which future generations will judge us harshly.””  The letter has been signed by the following organisations: Belfast Chamber Causeway Chamber of Commerce CBI NI Centre for Competitiveness Construction Employers Federation NI Federation of Small Businesses Northern Ireland Freight Transport Association Hospitality Ulster IoD NI Londonderry Chamber of Commerce Manufacturing NI Mineral Products Association NI Newry Chamber of Commerce  Trade NI Grain Trade Association NI Hotels Federation NI Tourism Alliance Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry Northern Ireland Food and Drink Association Northern Ireland Retail Consortium Retail NI Women in Business NIView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/qub_1.jpg","title":"ulster business top  sees sales rise by ","story":"Posted on Monday August  by Ulster Business Michael Neill, head of office, AL Goodbody Belfast, sponsor of the Top , Flavio Malnarcic, chief financial officer, Moy Park and Ulster Business editor John Mulgrew Northern Ireland’s largest businesses have seen sales rise by .% to more £.bn, the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list  has revealed.The list, sponsored by AL Goodbody, showcases the successes of the biggest firms from right across Northern Ireland.

Editor John Mulgrew looks at the numbers, the analysis and the once household names no longer with us The tattered corner of the Ulster Business Top  list from  probably isn’t the worst way to analogise the then state of the Northern Ireland economy, and a precursor to what was around the cornerWe’ve come a very long way in a decade, and while there are some big and familiar names on the  Top  list, there are firms which have fallen off it entirely, and resigned to the history books post-recession.In former editor David Elliott’s intro to the magazine, it references the fact that most of the accounting periods in the list were just as the downturn was starting to gather pace.Economist John Simpson, writing in the edition, says the “big recession of  and  did not impact evenly across the economy, and recovery will be best seen as a sequence of dferent proportions”.There are some positive things to take from it – including a large glowing image of Victoria Square, which in the more than  years since it opened in the heart of Belfast has become part of the retail fabric of the city.Topping the list at the time was Viridian Group, which owned Northern Ireland Electricity and now includes Power NI as a subsidiary, with turnover of £.bn. However, it made a loss of £m during that period.Second on the list is a business familiar to many. Quinn Group, headed by Co Fermanagh businessman Sean Quinn, posted turnover of £.bn for the year ending    but incurred a loss of more than £m during the same period. There have been enough column inches written about the business in the years since then to fill many a book – and they have.Among those no longer on the list is developer David Patton  SonsLtd, Armaghdown Creameries Ltd and Ballyrogan Holdings.Many others on the list have since been acquired by some of the now giants in their respective industries.Moy Park is an interesting one. Back then it was still a large player in the poultry sector with turnover of £m.Those fortunes have evidently changed dramatically since then, as the company has held the top spot on the list for the last eight years, and now posts big profits and turnover of £.bn.Meanwhile, WR Barnett is on the  list in position , with a turnover of £m and pre-tax profits of £m. In the last  years, it has climbed the list to comfortably take the number two spot with sales of almost  times that of those a decade earlier.As far as employment goes, it was Tesco topping the list in , followed by Bombardier – which at the time had a workforce of around , people – with Royal Mail and Queen’s University following in third and fourth position.A lot has happened in the years since that list. The economy has slowly but surely gotten back on its feet. Growth has been gradual, and in the last year or so has been sitting at around %, while employment levels and unemployment levels are at their respective positive record levels. However, we are amid the most challenging time for business in a generation and some of the signs, and whispered conversations, are far from positive. As I write this, we still sit on the precipice of whether we secure an agreement on Brexit, or shuffle off the edge without a parachute. Let’s hope it’s the former.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/flav_1.jpg","title":"top  moy park takes number one spot","story":"Posted on Thursday August  by Ulster Business From a purely editorial perspective it would be refreshing to have a dferent company head up the Ulster Business Top  Northern Ireland Companies list.But Moy Park has now made it to the top for eight consecutive years, as the poultry processing giant continues to expand both its workforce, global sales and pre-tax profit – firmly setting its place at Northern Ireland’s biggest business, with a workforce of more than , here alone.In the last year, it has grown turnover to just over £.bn, up from £.bn a year earlier, while pre-tax profits have surged by % – rising to £.m in its latest set of accounts, ending December .The business supplies Moy Park branded and own label chicken products to leading retailers and foodservice providers throughout the UK, Ireland and Europe.In numbers, Moy Park processes six million fresh chickens each week, , turkeys a year, along with , tonnes of other ‘added value products’.London-born Chris Kirke replaced long-serving boss Janet McCollum in , less than a year after Craigavon-based Moy Park was taken over by new US owners Pilgrim’s.And around a year ago, Flavio Malnarcicjoined the business – then as executive business director – before taking over as the firm’s chief financial officer.He was formerly business director at JBS Global, and has a senior leadership background as executive director of the poultry and export business in Seara, also as chief financial officer and chief executive at Tyson do Brazil and finance roles in Cargill.“There has been a consistence in the performance. We have been growing volumes… we got to six million birds each week, which is about a third of the UK market. For the UK, it is a signicantly big company.“Looking year-over-year, our performance was very consistent in the last few years.”“For people working there, working for a company which is the largest employer in a country, the top company, it is a source of pride for us.“But I don’t think that drives the behaviour of the team. We are more interested in making sure that our performance is sustainable in terms of margins.“It is nice that we arebut that is not our main goal. We are making sure that we are sustainable, work on quality, safety. There are lots of other things. It’s making sure that we fit our customer needs.“We have a lot focus on that, and we need to be competitive.”And as for growth, expanding turnover isn’t necessarily the main focus, according to Flavio“A lot of the efforts in the last year have been to consolidate the management tools they have in Pilgrim’s. They are very keen on efficiency, so that’s one of their strategies. “ a lot of focus in improving our performance, it’s how we can be more efficient, focusing on a portfolio that feeds our customer base, how we deal with our customers.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
