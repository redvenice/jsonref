The Queen, who has carried out investitures since 1952, wore gloves for the first time as she handed an MBE to D-Day veteran Harry Billinge last week Meanwhile Prince William could be seen on television making his own way down the same line and saying: \u0027Thank you… can\u0027t shake hands, but thank you.\u0027Later Prince Harry said farewell to singer Craig David, who also performed during the service, in his own indomitable way, \u0027elbow bumping\u0027 the star as the pair laughed.Boris Johnson said yesterday that the move not to shake hands at the Abbey sent a \u0027subliminal cue\u0027 about the importance of hygiene.The Prime Minister said: \u0027We were all given an instruction not to shake hands and there\u0027s a good reason for not shaking hands, which is that the behavioural psychologists say that if you don\u0027t shake somebody\u0027s hand then that sends an important message to them about the importance of washing your hands.\u0027So there\u0027s a subliminal cue there to everybody to wash your hands, which is, I think I\u0027m right in saying … far more important.\u0027Handshaking is \u0027a matter for inidual choice\u0027 but much less important than washing, he added.Mr Johnson, who attended the event with his pregnant fiancée, Carrie Symonds, had previously said he was \u0027shaking hands with everybody\u0027 despite concerns about the spread of the virus.Other senior royals including Charles, Camilla and William and Kate, who conducted a walkabout in Ireland last week, do not appear at the moment to be taking any greater precautions than normal for the time being.The royal households say they are following government advice carefully and will change practices if and when required."},{"url":null,"title":"Charlie Sheen vehemently denies Corey Feldmans new documentary","story":"Share this articleCorey Haim\u0027s Mom Denies Allegation That Her Son Was Sexually Abused by Charlie Sheen (Exclusive) | Entertainment Tonight"},{"url":null,"title":"HENRY DEEDES Boris beaming Rishi Sunaks budget","story":"Share this article He opened up by laying out his financial proposals for dealing with coronavirus.There were commitments to the NHS, to workers\u0027 sick pay, to delaying business rates.

It was horrific,” the tennis star says.But it was this newfound interest in art that led him to meet the British artist Maggi Hambling, whose new portrait of Murray is to go on display at the National Portrait Gallery. To this day, the pair disagree on how long she made him pose in his Wimbledon whites, while pretending to serve and return with his forehand and backhand.“It was actually a very short time,” Hambling insisted. “He says 10 minutes, I say less.”Murray recalled it slightly differently. “I kind of thought I would basically just be sitting. Posing in these positions … felt like quite a long time for me. I was there for three to four hours in total, we did have breaks. It was difficult, it was a physical morning.”The affection between artist and sportsman was obvious, the portrait a result of mutual admiration and now friendship.Murray’s disastrous attempt to have a go at art himself was a result of finding his wife’s canvases and paint in the house.“It’s like most things really, you think, ‘I could do that’ or ‘that’s not difficult’,” he said. “My wife was out that night, I was by myself in the house. She came back from dinner and was like, ‘What the hell have you done?’”The Murray artworks are, sadly, probably lost to the world. “Honestly they were horrendous, really bad.”The experience spurred him to try to understand and appreciate art, which led to him meeting and becoming a fan and friend of Hambling. The admiration is mutual. “I’ve been a great fan of Andy’s forever really,” said Hambling, who loves tennis. “When I was a child, Americans always won everything and what I admire about Andy is that he’s his own person, he is other things as well as a tennis player.”Hambling recalled Murray’s first visit to her Suffolk studio. “I was really impressed at the way you naturally looked at paintings. Not many people go up close and look at the detail and go back again… You seem to do that quite naturally.”For Murray the friendship has also been an education. “I’m quite naive when it comes to art so when I spend time with Maggi I tend to ask lots of questions and understand it better,” he said“He asks very difficult questions,” said Hambling. “I really have to think. Normally I don’t think I just pick up the brush and hope for the best. Andy does pepper me with difficult questions.”The painting enters the national collection thanks to a cash gift from an anonymous donor. Along with two preparatory drawings it will be on display in London until May, after which it travels to Edinburgh where it will go on display at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery.Hambling is a star of British art although she does have her detractors. The former theatre critic Charles Spencer once wrote that two of the sculptures “he would like to smash” were Hambling’s sculpture of Oscar Wilde behind St Martins-in-the-Fields in London (“Hideous is too gentle a word to describe it”) and her famous four-metre high Scallop on the beach at Aldeburgh, a tribute to Benjamin Britten.Murray, however, is a huge admirer and now owns seven Hambling paintings. He said the sittings, last September, were fun albeit not what he was expecting.“I made him do these impossible poses,” said Hambling. “He brought his whites because, of course, it had to be Wimbledon. If you think about tennis you’re either hitting the ball against the sky or against the grass so Andy’s movement between the two is very much what the painting is about.“Most people’s idea of a portrait is someone sitting on a chair, their head and shoulders. That’s not how it is for me. Andy is about playing tennis. You are the most miraculous tennis player, that’s why it had to work as a painting about movement.”Both of them think there are similarities between artists and tennis players. “It is all hand and eye,” said Hambling. “Andy is obviously a complete lunatic giving his life to tennis as I’m a lunatic giving my life to art, but it is hand and eye but most importantly heart. You have to be completely obsessed.”Murray said tennis players and artists were both at their best when they were in the zone, not thinking and letting things just happen. “When you start to overthink things it doesn’t work.”Murray, a double Wimbledon winner and Olympic gold medallist, is not known for his effusiveness so when asked what emotions he felt looking at the painting he was typically low key.“I really like it. Because it is just very different to what I expected. When you speak about a portrait I didn’t expect to see something like that. I like it and obviously because I know Maggi really well too, it just means a little bit more. There’s a personal relationship there.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2735eb7f6c647e035fb787802fb09c58760e3b25/214_331_6445_3867/master/6445.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4e5458615426d32b2812c10209dc274b","title":"metallica james hetfield ross halfin best photograph","story":"‘Their drummer Lars Ulrich called me up and I kept avoiding him – I thought he looked like an idiot. But I shot them in 1984 and have worked with them ever since’My aim when shooting a show is to give somebody something they would not normally have seen. And to create an image that is unusual or exciting, so when people who went to the show look at it, they see something that’s special. People who shoot shows tend to panic, but if you do that, you get nothing. Stand back and wait. Think about what you’re doing – I learned that from Fin Costello. I don’t find it hard to get original images from live shows, because I know what I’m doing – I’ve done it for so long. Nowadays, a lot of bands want to control everything and they ban photographers from shows. Yet they’re quite happy, having thrown out the people doing it properly, to let anybody take bad pictures or film it on an iPhone.I first shot Metallica in 1984. Their drummer, Lars Ulrich, would call me me up, and I kept avoiding him. I’d seen pictures of him, and I thought he was just this Danish guy who looked like a complete idiot. But then Metallica’s manager, Peter Mensch, called me and said: “Listen, stop being such an asshole. Go to San Francisco and shoot my new band.” So I did, and that was the start of my relationship with them. In fact, the only reason I ended up shooting Metallica was because they wanted Iron Maiden’s photographer – I was working for them at the time. To Metallica, Led Zeppelin (who I also worked with) meant nothing. But Iron Maiden meant something and Metallica wanted their photographer. I’ve worked with them ever since. I’ll give the group their due: they are very conscious of who they are, what they do and how they want to be photographed. But they are also very open to doing different things.I am a rock photographer, not just hard rock or metal. I am particularly known for metal because I worked for Kerrang! magazine in the 80s, but that was more because instead of going to Leeds to shoot the Pet Shop Boys, I could go to Hawaii to do Aerosmith. Where would you rather go? And at the time the National Union of Journalists made sure that if you shot colour you were paid twice as much as for black and white, and Kerrang! was full colour.The worst photoshoot I ever did was the first time I worked with Led Zeppelin in 1979. I was young, and really impressed. Robert Plant walked up to me and said: “Do you know how to take a Robert Plant photo?” He poked me in the chest and said, quite nastily: “Quickly.” I was shooting a cover for Sounds magazine, and I did the shoot, but I was so nervous that I did Plant’s photoshoot, not mine. I did what he wanted, which resulted in a very boring picture. I came away and I thought: “I will never let anyone do that to me again,” and I never have. I was so naive that he completely threw me. Don’t let them do that to you, because if you do, you are just going to get a boring portrait.Training: A course in fine art at Wimbledon College of Art.High point: My Jimmy Page picture getting displayed in the National Portrait Gallery.Low point: Shooting the first Spice Girls US tour. The band were OK, it was everyone around them.Top tip: Always take control.

With the number of new reported cases of infection declining rapidly in China, but soaring in what is now a semi-locked-down Italy, it’s worth looking at the experiences and strategies of countries to see what can be learned. Governments are faced with stark choices, says Roy Anderson of Imperial College in London, one of the UK’s most eminent epidemiologists. There are essentially four options. You could try to minimise the number of fatalities or the economic impact. You could attempt to flatten the peaked curve in the incidence so that the cases are not all concentrated in a narrow time , which could overwhelm healthcare resources (already severely stretched in the UK). Or you could try to delay the spread in order to buy time for development of a vaccine – although most experts don’t expect one to be available for at least a year.The politicians and policymakers want a strategy to achieve all four, says Anderson – but that’s not possible. In particular, the first two crucial goals – reducing the mortality rate and economic impact – are incompatible. There are “difficult decisions ahead for governments”, Anderson and colleagues wrote in the Lancet last week.China’s draconian approach – essentially bringing normal life to a standstill in affected cities and regions – paid off, says Anderson. But whether that would be possible in western democracies is another matter. Italy’s strategy – which is now to close all schools and universities, impose travel restrictions and prohibit large public gatherings – could work, but it doesn’t seem to have the rigour of the Chinese model: flights are still coming and going in Milan, and the trains are running.The truth, Anderson adds, is that we just don’t know what the best strategy is. There are too many unknowns for mathematical models and predictions to be reliable. “It’s more suck it and see,” he says.In part, this is because we don’t have enough information about the biology of the virus. One crucial factor is the degree of infectiousness: how many people, on average, will catch the virus from an infected inidual. The coronavirus Covid-19 is more contagious than influenza: every person who gets coronavirus will typically pass it on to 2.5 people (at least in the early stages of an epidemic), compared to an infection rate of around 1.3 for ordinary flu.A big unknown is how readily children – who seem to contract only mild symptoms – can pass on the infection. No child seems yet to have been at the start of a chain of transmission, although that doesn’t negate the possible benefits of closing schools. “You don’t take chances with children,” Bruce Aylward, an epidemiologist and assistant director general of the World Health Organization, who observed the Chinese response in Wuhan in February, told the New York Times.The problem is worsened by the fact that people who have the virus may start to feel ill only after they have already been infectious for a day or two, whereas people with Sars were hardly infectious at all before they felt ill. And people with coronavirus remain infectious for a relatively long time, perhaps around seven days, whereas this period was just a few days for the H1N1 swine flu that led to a pandemic in 2009. What’s more, we don’t know how many infected people are virtually free of symptoms.The only way to know that, says Anderson, is with intensive testing of a large random sample of the population, looking not for evidence of a live virus but for antibodies in the bloodstream that signify they have at some point been infected. Such studies are now being done in China, but there are no results yet.The key objective is clear enough: to reduce the period from the first appearance of symptoms to the isolation of the inidual.“China got it down to two days,” says Anderson. “That’s what you need to aim for.” The Chinese were also good at tracing people contacted by infected iniduals, and testing them. That’s a labour-intensive task, and Anderson thinks such efforts are probably understaffed here. “The critical thing is to have very strong surveillance systems that will give you early warning of infection,” says Anne Johnson, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at University College London. And then to “achieve rapid contact tracing and testing, and rapid isolation”.Anderson thinks the trajectory of the outbreak may depend not so much on how governments respond but on how we all do as iniduals. For example, most clusters of infection occur in families, so quick self-isolation from relatives can be crucial. So you should know the most common symptoms – fever and dry cough – and observe basic hygiene: hand-washing, wearing masks, not shaking hands (still my instinctive gesture when I met Anderson, which he politely reminded me to avoid). It’s about maintaining “high levels of respiratory hygiene”, says Johnson, and “really cutting down the numbers of contacts you have.” “We are all in this together,” Johnson says, a point that couldn’t be more apparent from the news that the health minister Nadine Dorries has tested positive for the virus.But some of these measures come at a cost. “All along the line we’re going to have to balance the biomedical impact against the social impact,” says Johnson. It may mostly affect those who are the most needy, she says, such as older people.Anderson thinks the places to learn from are not so much China or Italy but Hong Kong and Singapore. Both are, of course, very crowded places, yet they have kept case numbers in the hundreds. How? “The population reacted very differently to Europeans,” says Anderson. “They had seen Sars” in 2007, and so knew what was needed. They stopped going to restaurants and public events they wore face masks.To bring about such changes in behaviour here, Anderson says, requires clear and responsible public information. We can assume this excludes floating the “theory” that it could be best just to “take it on the chin” and let the infection move through the population, as Boris Johnson suggested on breakfast television.Information should be targeted in particular at the most vulnerable groups – the over-50s – and should make use of social media, and it’s important to get the tabloid press on board to communicate accurate information. So: an information campaign that leverages the power of Facebook and other social media, as well as the tabloids, to deliver information tailored to the inidual. Aren’t these the kind of skills the government has boasted of? Let’s hope they can put them to good use."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/212b264bb7e4e43327af317949bb2b0f731e3c62/0_130_3981_2390/master/3981.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55f3becc8f6669c8f3f802336662ee08","title":"rishi sunak budget fiscal policy economy power","story":"I am used to being astonished by Conservative budgets. Towards the end of my time as a special adviser to Vince Cable under the coalition, I was incredulous at how the then chancellor, George Osborne, was willing to threaten years more of cuts, despite having already slashed spending across the “non-protected” departments. Never mind whether the economy could take it, or the bond markets demanded it – this was no longer cutting fat or even muscle, but bone.Now I stand equally astonished, but this time for the opposite reason. The figures produced by Rishi Sunak in his first outing as chancellor might have come from a Conservative attack document titled “Labour’s secret plans to borrow hundreds of billions”. Glance over the budget measures table and you can find promises to spend an extra £175bn over five years, and raise just £25bn of that in tax. And this not just for cherished projects like the doubling of R\u0026ampD or an infrastructure revolution – this is a chancellor willing to bandy around phrases like “fiscal stimulus”. The once-heretical idea that public spending might boost the economy is back with a bang.But in other regards the arguments then were no stronger than they are now. Fiscal stimulus makes sense when there are underused resources in the economy, and much less when it is at capacity. In 2013 unemployment was far higher than it is now, and there was still a lot of catching up to do after the collapse in spending after the financial crisis.And it is hard to find good uses for government investment I remember a Conservative Treasury minister complaining that “everyone keeps saying their spending idea will save money in the long run”. Misdirected spending can crowd out the private sector, waste resources, distort competition and even leave an area relying on the public purse rather than being left to stand on its own two feet. That kind of intelligent scepticism is as appropriate now as it was then – in fact, even more, now that so much of the new investment is aimed at such an avowedly political end as “levelling up” the regions newly converted to the Conservative cause.The truth is that fiscal policy is always more of a political choice than the politicians like to admit. Faced with the enormous implications of their decisions, some may find it easier to blame the markets or the unavoidable dictates of timeless rules than admit to real agency. From that point of view, Sunak’s budget is refreshing in more ways than one – here is a chancellor willing to use his autonomy to its full, astonishing extent. I just hope that all those warnings about the terrifying bond market really are only fairytales.• Giles Wilkes is a former adviser to Vince Cable and Theresa May on economic policy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72304ed74d1bd900584d187aa99fe7bdad25e760/0_0_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c9a08062c168218629ec95d3b23adc5f","title":"i dont have it my week of not being sick with coronavirus","story":"My house in the country is the perfect quarantine station but social distancing is fast beginning to lose its appealIt’s almost two weeks ago and we’re sitting on the terrace having breakfast in Siem Reap when one of us gets a text message from work.“It says if I have been travelling overseas, when I return I can’t go into the office and have to work from home.”We all fall about laughing. But you’re not sick! We say. You don’t have the virus. That’s crazy!People be freaking out, I think. We scroll on our phones over breakfast watching people in Australia brawl over loo paper.We laugh and shake our heads.Then my cleaner messages me. I have Airbnb guests at my place in the country this weekend but there’s no toilet paper anywhere in town. She sends me a photo of empty shelves.Suddenly I’m not laughing so much. The virus has barely touched the sides in Australia, and already people are panicking. I’m panicking. Do I have serviettes they can use? Paper towels? Back issues of the New Yorker?After Cambodia I am due to fly to Sydney, to attend the Sydney Writer’s’ Festival launch party and a 40th birthday. I arrange to work from both the ’s office and an office in Martin Place with a friend.Before I fly in from Cambodia, I get a message from another friend I’m staying with in Sydney, saying that yeah sure it’s still totally fine that I stay with her … she just needs to “get advice”.That’s weird. Get advice? What sort of advice?The penny drops. I don’t have it! I don’t have the virus!! I would know! I can stay, I’m not sick!My boss gets in touch. Can I please avoid the  offices in Melbourne and Sydney for two weeks?I don’t have it! I don’t have it! I feel great! My immune system has been stressed and strengthened over the years by years of unsanitary behaviour. Like, if a chip falls on the floor, I will still eat it.Another friend in Sydney sends me an updated NSW Health advisory as I’m about to get on the plane.“You need to go into quarantine!” she says. I don’t have it! I’m not sick!I read the advisory more closely. It says travellers returning from Cambodia and Thailand are not required to socially isolate but to socially distance.Socially distance? What the hell is that?I cancel all my Sydney commitments and return to my house in the country (with toilet rolls purchased in Cambodia) and prepare for two weeks of social distancing – which means refraining from attending crowds and mass gatherings, keeping a distance of 1.5 metres between people, avoiding shaking hands, hugging and kissing and staying away from elderly and sick people.Sometimes I wonder why, as a very urban, extroverted person, I bought a house in the country on a dirt road, backing on to a forest with only three or four other houses in the street.But under social distancing guidelines my purchase is coming into its own. I must have been psychic! This house is the perfect quarantine station.Day one is a novelty. I sleep in and write from bed. I tweet. I read obsessively about the coronavirus. I set up a home gym and do laps at 2.30pm around a deserted oval while listening to podcasts about the virus (my usual yoga class and going to the gym is out).On the second day, the postman comes bearing an enormous box of wellness supplements to be trialled for a magazine story I’m writing. I can just sit here, in the country, in my isolation with Cambodian toilet paper and survive off hundreds of dollars of expensive, celebrity endorsed supplements – and spend my days refreshing Twitter.Social distancing is fast beginning to lose its appeal.Later I try to cycle into town but my bike tyre is flat. It has a puncture. I can’t even wheel it down the driveway. It’s like “the universe” is a co-conspirator in my social distancing.I walk into town and go to the supermarket after dark. It’s pretty empty. I buy some food and manage to find it on a high shelf – an elusive four-pack of two-ply homebrand toilet paper.The following day, my elderly neighbour drops in. Bob is nearly 90 and it’s not unusual for him to chill with me for two or three hours and complain about the state of my garden. Once when I was away, he chopped down two trees that were actually noxious weeds. “Where have you been?” he asks. “You’ve been away so long I thought you got married in Thailand.”I tell him that I didn’t get married in Thailand, that I am now back – but due to government health warnings I need to socially distance myself because I have travelled to Thailand and Cambodia.“You need to stay at least a metre away from me,” I tell him hiding behind the door frame.Bob jumps back. He looks quite freaked out. “I can tell just by looking at you that you’re sick! You’re all red in the face.”I touch my face then remember I shouldn’t touch my face.“I’m not sick. I’m just being careful. It’s called social distancing.”Bob looks at the puncture in my tyre and says that he better not see me riding round town because, “You’re under community surveillance now. I don’t want you bringing the disease to these good people around here.”Bob doesn’t stick around. He tells me that I have his number: “Call me if you’re about to die.”I go inside and look in the mirror. My face is not red. It’s tanned. I’ve got a tan! I Google “red face” and coronavirus. Is it a symptom?Dodging Bob, I leave the house to have coffee with a friend. For the last three years Brad has been teaching me how to drive. Every time we meet, we have a mini driving lesson. That is not on the cards today as the front seats in his car are not 1.5 metres apart.Now I go on a run (the faster I move, the less time there is to expose myself to people) to meet Brad. We sit 1.5 metres apart, on an outside table so any germs I may have can air dry.Brad tells me he thought twice about seeing me – and by meeting he was taking a risk. I tell him I’m not sick and do not have the virus.“I am taking these supplements and I ran here! I’m OBSCENELY HEALTHY!”Brad also tells me about the toilet paper situation in town. “I bought some because I needed some. And I noticed everyone else in the line for the checkout also had toilet paper.” Brad said the vibe was a bit shifty, because there had been so much media about toilet paper hoarding.“Then I noticed there was a row of people standing outside the checkouts looking at all of us buying toilet paper!”We murmur about how crazy the world is right now.Brad goes to pay for the coffees. I slide over $4. He looks at my money like it might be contaminated.“For godsakes, I don’t have it!!!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9906dcd6d432652a3a0dc7a305cdbb634ab5526e/262_0_1888_1133/master/1888.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1736faffe5f1821f0d37b601f45bad9f","title":"david attenborough calls for ban on devastating deep sea mining","story":"Proposed mining of seabed could destroy unstudied ecosystems and disrupt vital carbon-storing functions, says naturalistSir David Attenborough has urged governments to ban deep sea mining, following a study warning of “potentially disastrous” risks to the ocean’s life-support systems if it goes ahead.The study, by Fauna and Flora International (FFI), warns proposed plans to mine the seabed could cause significant loss of bioersity, disruption of the ocean’s “biological pump”, and the loss of microbes important for storing carbon. The process, requiring machines operating thousands of metres under the sea, could also create plumes of sediment that smother areas far from the mining sites and kill wildlife.Dozens of exploratory licences, two of which are sponsored by the UK, have already been granted for huge tracts of the sea bed, ahead of a race to mine commercially for ores and minerals such as copper, used in mobile phones and batteries. But the rules to govern the responsible exploitation of this global resource are not finalised – they are expected to be completed at a meeting in July at the UN International Seabed Authority.Attenborough, the vice president of FFI, said deep sea mining could create a “devastating series of impacts” threatening processes critical to the health and function of the oceans, and called on governments to be guided by scientists.“Fauna \u0026amp Flora International is calling on global governments to put in place a moratorium on all deep sea mining – a call I wholeheartedly support,” Attenborough said.In a foreword to the report, Attenborough said it was “beyond reason” for countries to consider the destruction of deep sea places before they have understood them or the role they play in the health of the planet.Attenborough said: “The rush to mine this pristine and unexplored environment risks creating terrible impacts that cannot be reversed. We need to be guided by science when faced with decisions of such great environmental consequence.”Oceans are becoming more acidic because of the carbon dioxide dissolving into them, fisheries are under pressure as a result of over-exploitation and there are hundreds of huge “dead zones”, it said.Pippa Howard, director at FFI and lead author of the report, called for a moratorium on deep sea mining. She said: “The conclusions we have come to after extensive study could hardly be more troubling.“From methane release to disruption of the ocean’s life-support systems and the destruction of unstudied ecosystems, the risks of deep sea mining are numerous and potentially disastrous.”Louise Casson, of Greenpeace’s Protect the Oceans campaign, said the UK government’s holding of exploration contracts for deep sea mining was at odds with its position as a “global ocean champion”.Casson said: “The UK government now has a choice to make: listen to industry and press ahead with this dangerous new practice, or listen to scientific warnings, public concern and the creator of Blue Planet himself and ban deep sea mining.”A government spokesman said: “The UK continues to press for the highest international environmental standards, including on deep sea mineral extraction.“While we have sponsored two exploration licences, these allow only for marine research to understand the effects of deep sea mining.“We will not issue a single exploitation licence without a full assessment of the environmental impact.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baaa9f77bdfea38902e756dd2817e46f88a5751b/0_68_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b33e2336730c054594ef4b8266f005a9","title":"wales launches 5m national forest scheme with pupils help","story":"Green corridor for wildlife will also help to meet carbon targetsIt was hard, chilly work for nine-year-old Alfie Perry and his eight-year-old classmate Dempsey Owens.But, after a bit of cajoling from their pals and teacher on a windswept hillside above the town of Neath, the pair succeeded in planting a sessile oak that could soon be part of a forest stretching continuously the length and breadth of Wales.The Welsh government is initially ploughing £5m into its national forest scheme, aiming to link existing woodland with new forests, parkland and hedges, creating green corridors for flora and fauna – and people.The Labour-led government says the scheme will help it to create new, important environments, meet carbon reduction targets, combat flooding – but also boost tourism and people’s sense of wellbeing as they criss-cross the country under, or next to, trees.Lesley Griffiths, the Welsh government’s environment minister, was on hand in Neath to help Alfie and Dempsey dig and set out the vision.“We love our woodland in Wales,” Griffiths said. “Welsh businesses, communities and, particularly, our farmers and foresters, will want to help create the national forest.”Griffiths accepted there would be challenges but pointed out that people had doubted the country could create a footpath right around the coast, but it had done just that. “We’re a small country. You’re able to do things differently.”The spot for the launch – Coed Brynau - is a beautiful one. High above Neath, with views of the Brecon Beacons and the Mumbles Lighthouse, Coed Cadw (the Woodland Trust in Wales) is in the process of planting 150,000 trees here by 2025, including rare species such as the small-leaved lime and the black poplar.The estate used to be owned by the coalmine owner and Tory MP Herbert Mackworth (1687-1765), who created a parkland on the hill. There are vestiges of ancient woodland that will be linked with the new tree planting.The area is home to barn owls, Daubenton’s bats and possibly the very rare blue ground beetle. Welsh white cows, which look ghostly in the landscape, are being introduced to graze grassland areas of the site.There is not yet a route for the forest – this will evolve as the consultation moves on.But Natalie Buttriss, director of Coed Cadw, suggested one option could be to link the great forest of Wentwood in Monmouthshire along the M4 corridor to Coed Brynau.Chris Matts, Coed Cadw’s woodland manager for south and west Wales, likes the government’s ambition, though he thinks perhaps forest is the wrong word. “It’s a word that in English originally meant a hunting ground for kings,” he said.Matts prefers the Welsh word: coed, which has more of the connotation of “an area of trees”, which takes in parkland and hedgerows as well as thick forest and woodland.Mary Gagen, a professor of geography at Swansea University, praised the ambition of the scheme. “We need to get trees in the ground now. Trees are a brilliant multi-tasker, good for the environment, good for habitats, good for us.”The Welsh first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the February floods reinforced the need to plant more trees.“In planting, growing and protecting the right network of trees we can increase our resilience to flooding.“Trees improve air quality, they remove harmful greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, they provide material for construction, they regenerate soil for food, they clean the water in our rivers and they provide a home to all the life that finds shelter in their canopy.“The project is ambitious and dynamic and will not grow overnight. Over the next 20 years, we will work with all kinds of stakeholders – from the Woodland Trust to farmers, landowners and school pupils – to grow the right network of trees that will greatly improve bioersity, trap carbon from the air and provide economic opportunities too.“These ambitious projects work – the Wales Coast Path, which created a path around the entire coastline of Wales, has been a real success story. We’re looking forward to growing a forest that benefits Wales for future generations to come.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c280d6c1f34856fe9ef401f068cf352997ee5d0f/0_14_1600_960/master/1600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b292fbadbb446b08a4087d906e152f50","title":"2020 mammal photographer of the year winners","story":"The winners of the Mammal Society’s annual photographic competition have been announced and the first prize has been claimed by amateur photographer Roger Cox from East London.

But could you go for 10 years without shopping?  readers tell us how – and why – they haveWhen the former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq told the hosts of Loose Women that she had not bought any clothes in a decade, she was met with consternation and shock from the show’s famously forthright panellists. “You’re not still wearing Blue Peter clothes!” exclaimed Janet Street-Porter. Huq acknowledged, sheepishly, that the lilac cardigan she was wearing did in fact date from her days on children’s TV.Huq’s no-clothes purchasing policy made headlines across the UK. But away from media scrutiny and bemused TV hosts, many ordinary people have been quietly wearing the same clothes day-in, day-out, for the past decade, too. We spoke with  readers who never buy clothes, to ask them how they stay presentable, stop things from wearing out and where they would be if their loved ones didn’t buy them socks come Christmas.I used to care about clothes when I was younger. But then I went to university to study product design and I realised that consumer culture really didn’t sit well with me. We were being trained to design want and need in people. It didn’t feel right.The majority of my clothes are well over a decade old. Some of them do look a bit tatty, I’m not going to lie. I do understand that your first appearance counts for something in society, and that people might look at my clothes and think about me in a certain way. But for me personally, it is more important to be true to what I believe in than care about what other people might think.I last bought a Paul Smith jumper about nine or 10 years ago. It was £140, which is a lot of money, but I still wear it today, and it looks the same as the day I bought it. The most loved item in my wardrobe is a pair of David Beckham-endorsed Adidas shorts I bought when I was 14. I still wear them all the time. The elastic is gone, so I do have to be careful to make sure the drawstring is tied up! They have started to peel a bit.My mum and dad are always trying to buy me new clothes. They are Thatcher’s children: materialism was drilled into that generation buying stuff empowers them. My mum recently insisted on buying me a coat, but only because she was so fed up with the old Barbour jacket I had been wearing.It was my grandad’s Barbour: he has sadly passed away, so I took it from his house after he died. That’s not the only thing I took, actually I wear my grandad’s old Slazenger boxers. My girlfriend thinks it is really weird.I loved that Barbour jacket. It was ancient I kept sending it to the Barbour shop to get it repaired, but they repaired it so many times it was basically a new coat.I never get bored of my clothes. I think that people are told that they need to buy new clothes to fit in and seem trendy, but it is only you who inherently cares what you look like. People are too immersed in their own lives to notice you only have four T-shirts. That stuff doesn’t matter. We have become so selfish as human beings. We are bred to consume. Nothing has any value any more.I am of Asian heritage: my family is from India and Pakistan. I think that’s why I am really reluctant to buy clothes. It is horrible for me to know that people of my heritage are being abused by the garment industry to produce clothes for people in the west who don’t care about their wellbeing.I remember watching the footage of the 2012 Dhaka garment factory fire. It was horrific, watching people try to escape. I don’t like to stand on a soapbox and say: “You should do this, and you should do that.” But for me personally, buying clothes isn’t something I want to do. It’s how I am.Apart from tights and the odd bit of underwear, I haven’t bought any clothes for a decade. I make all of my clothes, myself, by hand. I learned to sew from my mum. She was always immaculate she never had a hair out of place. Just the sweetest, most caring person. She died recently. When I am sewing, I feel close to her. She really knew how to sew.Virtually all the fabric I use is vintage. Buying new fabric is really the same as buying fast fashion, in my book. Why do we need new fabric? There’s already so much beautiful fabric in the world. I work with a charity called Tools for Self Reliance, and they get donated lots of old material. If I see something I like the look of, I pop a donation in the collection box. I also have reams and reams of fabric that I purchased in the 1980s from a dressmaking shop: it was closing down, and the owner let me have it cheap.Most of the time, I am a bit of a scruff. But when I am teaching dressmaking, I make an effort. You want to look nice, because you’re an advert for the clothes you are teaching people to make. I follow trends on social media, and then teach people how to make the clothes at my workshops. You get all sorts: doctors, solicitors, care workers. They all say it is therapeutic.I don’t get bored of my wardrobe, because if I want something new I can just nip upstairs to my sewing room and make it. I can make a shift dress in half an hour I call them my half-hour dresses. I just made a ball gown from old fabric over a few days.I never want to buy things. I look at things in shops and think the quality is abysmal. My daughter makes her own clothes now. I am so glad she is not spending her pennies in those dreadful shops. But I really don’t want to sound like I’m on my high horse. I just want to educate people.Everything in my wardrobe is certainly not from this century. I have had the same ties since the 1980s. I think the last time I bought clothes was in 1984: I was on a business trip and they lost my suitcase, so I went to a shop in Rome and bought new suits, shirts, trousers and underwear.Technically, I could buy clothes. I know where Marks \u0026amp Spencer is! I just prefer not to go shopping. Ever since Woolworths closed, I can’t think of a decent shop. Shopping is so tedious. I can do a supermarket shop, because I have to, otherwise I would starve. But that’s it.I do occasionally get marched to TK Maxx by some lady friends who buy things for me. Whatever they choose is fine. Everything else in my wardrobe seems to arrive! My brother-in-law gives me shirts and pullovers. It’s usually when people think I am looking mucky that stuff tends to turn up. I never ask for anything new. Hand-me-downs look new to me! I can’t tell the difference.I look like a mess, but I don’t really care. It is the same with haircuts: I only get them if I have got to meet the bank manager or something like that. The only thing I buy for myself is socks and pants.I have a woman who comes to clean my house for me and she’s not averse to throwing clothes and shoes away that she deems unwearable. I don’t mind as long as she tells me what she’s chucking out, otherwise I spend ages looking for it and can’t find it. She thinks shirts should have all the buttons on them and rubbish like that. They don’t really. As long as there are some buttons, it will work.Thirty-four years ago, I was pregnant with my daughter back home in Greece. The Chernobyl nuclear disaster happened and pregnant women were advised not to eat any fresh food. That experience really changed my thinking about the environment.I became an accountant, then moved to the UK and studied environmental science. But my interest in the environment and how we consume clothes never went away. Back in Greece when I was growing up, everything was about consumerism. Being a Greek woman who never went shopping, people thought I was crazy!I think I have bought one pair of jeans in the past 10 years. That’s it. My wardrobe is basically empty. It is easy to find everything in there. When I need clothes for a special occasion, like a wedding, I either borrow something from a friend, or there are platforms now where you can rent clothes.It helps that I am the same dress size I was when I was 20. I try to keep fit and not gain weight. Everything in my wardrobe still fits. All my clothes are very good quality: I have a coat that I have worn for 24 years. I take excellent care of it and it’s still in good condition. If you looked at it, you wouldn’t believe I’d had it for so long.Part of the reason my clothes last is because I don’t over-wash them. I have a rule that I wear everything at least twice – underwear excluded, obviously – before washing it. I can wear jeans five or six times before putting them in the machine. I mend all my clothes. If I need a new sweater, I knit something. My friends will often give me wool or yarn. Knitting helps me relax.Never buying clothes feels liberating. I love not having to think about clothes all the time. I have a few things in my wardrobe. Everything goes together. I never worry about what I am going to wear. For me, it has always been simple.I have a bit of a phobia about new clothes. It is about comfort I’m very particular about things. I hate clothes that are too clingy or tight. Animal fibres make me really itchy. I think maybe I am a bit allergic to wool.I like to wear old clothes, because I know they will be comfortable. I don’t like the texture of new clothes at all. It is a bit of a paradox, because in order for things to get old you have got to wear them a lot. If I had the choice between wearing an old item or something new, I’d always go for the old thing.My wife likes to sneak a few new things in my wardrobe from time to time, so I am better presented. She is into fashion and is always beautifully dressed. But the new things tend to stay in my wardrobe. I don’t wear them. Probably three-quarters of the things she buys me, I never wear.We’re at a bit of an impasse, my wife and I. She hasn’t stopped trying to smarten me up a bit and get me into some newer things, but I don’t find those things comfortable. It is a long-running battle, but we have a laugh about it. Sometimes she will drag me into a clothing store, and within 30 seconds I want to walk out.I am not bothered about my appearance or anything like that. Clothes for me are about comfort. Occasionally I will look at other men and think: “That jumper looks nice. I wish I had something like it.” But then I think that, even if I did have it, I would never wear it.Additional reporting by Laura Kay• This article was amended on 12 March 2020 because Athena Drakou became an accountant before she moved to the UK, not after she moved as an earlier version said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5940bb0355c10c2a25410ddbd988219a933c79cd/113_222_2511_1506/master/2511.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3d72b14e564d3fb6178045a34484549b","title":"comfort films to watch while self isolating coronavirus ranked","story":"Hunkering down to avoid coronavirus? With romcoms, fantasy yarns and at least one disaster melodrama, here’s all you need to make the most of your time in front of the TVDigital deepfakery has progressed since this emerged in 1995, but there is a warm glow to be had from the adorable talking piglet who wants to do the work of a sheepdog.It melts in the mouth like a Waitrose pain au chocolat. Amélie is the innocently mischievous gamine who has whimsical fantasy adventures in Paris.As with others on this list, there is a debate about whether really great films deserve a “comfort” ranking, but Humphrey and Ingrid’s great romance in wartime Morocco soothes the soul.In troubled times, we all need a blast of supermodel Derek Zoolander’s compelling “blue steel” face. A film that never goes out of fashion.Perhaps this is cheating (you could as well put on something from your Downton Abbey TV DVD boxset) but a visit to the Crawley family’s leisured world will go down like a non-Christmas glass of sherry.The Freudian themes might make it less comforting than other films here, but Marty McFly’s time-travel adventures in the small-town America of his parents’ youth is always reassuring.Great performances from Ralph Fiennes, Paul Scofield and John Turturro in this true story of a rigged TV quiz show. A morality tale that is weirdly calming and pacifying.Cinematic greatness is always comforting: wonderful songs and comedy in this fantastic New York musical with Vivian Blaine, Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons.Director Rob Reiner makes the first of his two appearances on this list with this great romantic comedy starring Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal.Jamie Foxx, Beyoncé, Jennifer Hudson and Danny Glover in this outrageously calorific double-helping of music and romance, all about the Detroit music scene from the 60s and 70s.Here to prove that sports movies can be as comforting as romances, and that they can moreover be romances, is Gina Prince-Blythewood’s Love \u0026amp Basketball. Omar Epps and Sanaa Lathan star as the boy and girl next door who are both fiercely good at basketball, and pretty competitive, and perhaps not yet ready to confess how into each other they are. It’s a very seductive love story with some sharp commentary on sexism on the basketball court.This supremely wacky and world-historically daft sci-fi extravaganza is just what you need to cheer you up, featuring as it does an outrageous scene-stealing turn from Eddie Redmayne, playing the scheming space-lord Balem, an epicene pharaoh of intergalactic evilness. He completely upstages the film’s notional leads Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis who encounter the vampirically arrogant alien clan – led by Redmayne. It really is wildly silly but very funny.When you want cinema itself to be your nanny, dispensing wisdom and comfort, here is the Julie Andrews classic, cheering you up, spit-spot.A wonderfully comforting movie that celebrates the world of idling, skiving, goofing off, and what the French flaneurs called “botanising on the asphalt”. Matthew Broderick plays a high-school kid from Chicago’s North Shore called Ferris Bueller who fakes an illness so he can award himself a personal day in the city with his girlfriend and his best friend, who will be bringing his dad’s treasured Ferrari. The movie bops around the city from joyous set-piece to joyous set-piece and some words from Ferris about how life goes by so fast that you have to make sure you appreciate it.The greatest Jane Austen adaptation in film history is also as richly comforting as drinking a mug of milky tea while curled up on the couch, eating a family-sized tub of Celebrations swathed in a cashmere slanket. Alicia Silverstone is glorious as Cher (the Emma of her day) who is happy, pretty and extremely well-meaning, with a great love of the mall, and an altruistic need to fix other people’s love lives. She achieves a strange kind of intimacy with her stepbrother Josh, an earnest college kid home for the vacation, played by Paul Rudd, and they hang out in the kitchen or huddled up watching TV – and realise that have feelings for each other.Unashamed and unabashed at all times, this is an industrial-strength Hollywood heartwarmer that lets you have the feelgood monosodium-glutamate right in your veins. Will Smith stars in this based-on-a-true-story of an ordinary guy who suffered heartbreak and homelessness as a single dad, and gets offered a once-in-a-lifetime shot out of poverty: an unpaid internship at a top financial firm. But he has to keep up appearances in front of all the other entitled Ivy Leaguers while covering up the fact that he is sleeping in a homeless shelter at night.At a time when all of us feel like nothing more than self-isolating and eating marmalade direct from the jar, here is one of the most profoundly comforting comedies of recent times, which incidentally shows how a confident nation is happy about immigrants. Hugh Grant gives what many believe to be the finest performance of his career as the peevish, cravat-wearing actor Phoenix Buchanan who steals a precious pop-up book with clues to hidden treasure from Mr Gruber’s shop – and frames Paddington for the crime. Despite doing jail time, the bear comes bouncing back.All together now: “By Grabthar’s hammer, by the Sons of Warvan, you shall be avenged!” Alan Rickman had a glorious role in this brilliant postmodern sci-fi comedy as Alexander Dane, the grumpy British thesp who had his moment of fame playing Dr Lazarus on a cancelled TV show called Galaxy Quest and now, like the rest of the jaded cast (including Sigourney Weaver and Tim Allen), makes a living going round fan conventions, signing photos and reciting the catchphrases to the tragic nerdy fans. But then a deputation from outer space arrives believing the show to be a documentary history of what actually happened, and desperately needing our heroes’ help. Galaxy Quest has one of the cleverest, funniest plot premises in film history, worked out to perfection.William Goldman, who adapted this movie from his own novel, became famous for his screenwriting axiom: “Nobody knows anything.” But we certainly know that this film is absolutely great: sweet, charming, funny, with a dash of idealism and a genuine eccentricity that distinguishes it from regular Hollywood product. Cary Elwes plays the handsome farmhand who falls in love with a beautiful noblewoman played by Robin Wright. Their love is sabotaged by evil court plotters but the lovers find friendship with the passionate, hot-headed Spanish swordsman Montoya, played by Mandy Patinkin. Great to watch with all the family, or the grownups can savour it all on their own.This inspirationally glutinous fantasy from screenwriter Richard Curtis is about what would happen if an ordinary civilian bloke (and a Brit, to boot) fell for a super-glamorous Hollywood star, and she with him. The bloke is the tousle-haired stammerer Hugh Grant (making his second appearance on this list) and the star is Julia Roberts, who had what some of us believe to be her greatest career moment in Notting Hill, and the scene when she tearfully tells him that she’s just a girl standing in front of a boy is a classic. Rhys Ifans found stardom as Hugh’s appalling flatmate Spike who says: “I’m going to tell you a story that will make your balls shrink to the size of raisins”, which incidentally is what happens to the male audience when the arrogant star, played by Alec Baldwin, dismisses poor Hugh from the hotel where he had been hoping to have sex with Julia. But it all ends happily.A brilliant and rather prescient satire on 1930s nationalism and indeed fascism, but also a hilarious comedy. The bizarre Ruritanian state of Freedonia, in deepest central Europe, is enduring a continuous and worsening economic crisis and forever on the verge of war with its equally belligerent neighbour Sylvania. But a rescue plan is at hand. A wealthy American widow (played in magnificent deadpan by Margaret Dumont) offers a multimillion dollar loan to Freedonia’s coffers on condition that they install her close friend as president – and that is the free-thinking visionary and genius, Rufus T Firefly, played by Groucho Marx. Wisecracking Rufus soon causes mayhem in Freedonia’s quasi-fascist staterooms. Is this the US’s quasi-colonialism in action?Nancy Meyers is the Michelin-starred chef of cinematic comfort cuisine and here she serves up a richly flavoured dish of escapist storytelling, a veritable festival of gastro-lifestyle porn featuring very rich people who don’t particularly regard themselves as rich. Meryl Streep is the orced woman with grown-up kids who is now a “chocolatier”, of all the outrageously implausible things, running an upscale deli-cum-eaterie, although the actual work involved is minimal. Her roguish lawyer ex-husband, played by Alec Baldwin, broke her heart by running off with a hard-faced younger woman who is now failing to satisfy him on the life-affirming laughter front, so he starts having an affair with his ex-wife. You really do need to suspend your disbelief in this world of almost weightless freedom from work and ordinary money worries, but it is undeniably enjoyable and comforting in its weird way.Waiting to Exhale is basically the equivalent to eating an entire Haagen Dazs tub of ice-cream while watching the greatest daytime soap opera of all time – and it is tremendously addictive. Angela Bassett, Whitney Houston, Loretta Devine and Lela Rochon play four smart, successful women who are discontented with the men in their lives – and the way society somehow finds that a woman’s inability to be in a relationship with a man makes their other accomplishments somehow second-rate. But these discontents are showcased in a horribly watchable world of nice clothes and nice cars. It also has a great male cast, including Wendell Pierce, later to be Bunk in The Wire and Willy Loman in Death of a Salesman on the London stage.Meryl Streep makes her second appearance on this list in this fashion comedy movie based on the Lauren Weisberger novel, reportedly inspired by the terrifying fashion empress Anna Wintour. It is a comedy, but without the sharp, angular edges of satire or bleakness that might endanger the comfort factor. New York City is replete with glamour and gorgeousness as the location for this aspirational story: Anne Hathaway is the callow literature graduate from the sticks who somehow flukes a job at the colossally prestigious fashion magazine Runway edited by Streep’s terrifying Miranda Priestly, the boss from hell who enforces a Stockholm-Syndrome love on all her employees and on us, the audience. Stanley Tucci is wonderful as her long-serving, long-suffering senior executive and this was the film that launched the elegant Emily Blunt on the world, as the super-snobbish fashionista who is to be Hathaway’s unwilling guide.There can surely be no doubt as to the No 1 slot. As Liam Neeson says in Love Actually: “We need Kate and we need Leo and we need them now.” Cheesy it may be, but this film delivers weapons-grade feelgood – and, at well over three hours, it delivers an awful lot of it. Because, paradoxically, nothing says filmic comfort eating like screaming in terror and being plunged into the icy Atlantic ocean, resurfacing, discovering that for some reason the woman you are in love with somehow can’t scooch up on her bit of driftwood to let you on, and then going back down again, with Céline Dion in the background singing that her heart will go on. Kate Winslet found her moment of global greatness as Rose, the young well-born passenger in first class who is unhappily engaged to creepy Billy Zane (fated not to cover himself with glory once the trouble starts). Rose finds that she has a distinct spark with Leonardo DiCaprio’s Jack who has won his third-class ticket in a poker game and thinks himself the luckiest young fellow in the world to have got on board for this exciting maiden voyage – especially when he feels that Rose is in love with him, and secretly gets to paint her in the nude. (That’s her in the nude, not him.) It is amazing to think that just before this film was released, all the talk was about how it could be a disaster – how it was going to be like Lew Grade’s Raise the Titanic what a tyrannical monster Cameron was to his cast etc – but the film’s instant rip-roaring success simply blew all this away. A film to lull you into a bovine stupor of wellbeing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c24fd8da9619f4499be44c5484cbbad66f25abfd/0_0_2859_1716/master/2859.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=81e50327d5317feb967f2f8a05d77418","title":"coronavirus binge watching netflix streamers viral","story":"With cinemas closing and millions of people around the world trapped at home in quarantine, could Covid-19 be a boon for streamers such as Netflix?Was the coronavirus engineered by Netflix? This was one of the wilder conspiracy theories doing the rounds earlier this month, as observers noted how the streaming giant’s new docuseries Pandemic: How to Prevent an Outbreak dropped into subscribers’ menus just as the world was experiencing exactly the type of once-in-a-century outbreak it was warning against. Coincidence? Good timing? Massively implausible homicidal marketing strategy? “We hoped to inform before, not after, another dangerous pathogen emerged,” explained Pandemic’s producers.But now that the Covid-19 virus is disrupting global business and behaviour, streamers like Netflix seem to be in a fortunate position. Public gatherings are being discouraged or avoided, including cinema-going. High-profile releases are being postponed, such as the latest James Bond instalment, No Time to Die, Peter Rabbit 2, A Quiet Place Part II and Fast \u0026amp Furious 9. People are being quarantined or self-isolating, which means they are trapped at home with hours to fill like never before. In other words, conditions are perfect for a marathon binge-watch.Whether or not the streaming giants profit in the short term, the coronavirus could still have long-term consequences for the industry. That has certainly been the case in China, where the pandemic first struck. Most of China’s nearly 70,000 cinemas closed in late January – just before the Chinese new year holiday, traditionally the most lucrative box-office period. Major movie releases were cancelled. In response, one of them, local comedy Lost in Russia, sold its rights to local streaming platform Bytedance (which also owns the TikTok app), which streamed Lost in Russia for free. It was watched by 180 million viewers in its first three days. By comparison, China’s all-time highest-grossing movie, Wolf Warrior 2, sold 159 million tickets.Western moviegoers are now accustomed to high-profile movies going straight to streaming, such as Netflix’s releases of The Irishman and Marriage Story, but for China’s booming industry, this was an unprecedented step. Another Chinese New Year movie, the Hong Kong-made Enter the Fat Dragon, made a similar streaming deal with iQiyi – China’s answer to Netflix. (Netflix itself is unavailable in China except via illegal VPN).Now it’s had a taste of streaming, China is unlikely to go back, says Elaine Chau, a Beijing-based journalist. Quarantined in their apartments, Chinese people have learned to love online viewing, whether that be new movies, cooking shows or livestreams of strangers doing banal indoor activities like sewing. “People are getting bored,” Chau says. “Many people in China like going to the cinema, but they’ve been getting into the habit of watching whatever they want, at their convenience, with no need to buy a ticket. So I think this coronavirus is definitely going to affect movie distribution models and earnings. The cinema chains are very on edge.”Could it happen here? The longer the pandemic goes on, the more the industry will be disrupted: falling box office revenues, releases postponed or cancelled, delays and logjams in the release schedules, and ultimately, productions delayed or cancelled – which affects the streamers as much as cinema companies. As for cinema losing ground to streaming permanently, the jury is out. “I think people have taken up the streaming habit in a pretty significant way already,” says Matt Mueller, editor of Screen International. “You could see a rebound effect. If people are restricted to their homes because of a pandemic, then by the time it lifts, they will be desperate to get back out into the world, and I think you will probably see a surge in cinema-going.” Mueller points out that despite streaming’s incursions, cinema has been thriving in the UK. “In the past two or three years we have had the highest cinema admissions ever. Whether that continues long term we don’t know, but for now there is still an appetite to see things on the big screen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9833cc3e1123e5e00dc8cb7b43c3df468703a5f6/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=261a614f1c3ac7fe4f329a8b653a7e94","title":"quiet place part ii release postponed coronavirus pandemic","story":"F9 and A Quiet Place Part II have abandoned their release dates as studios deal with the fallout from the spread of the virusThe horror sequel A Quiet Place Part II and action thriller follow-up Fast \u0026amp Furious 9 are being postponed over fears linked to the coronavirus pandemic.The follow-up to the 2018 hit A Quiet Place was due to launch globally from 18 March but director John Krasinski announced on Thursday on Instagram that it would be moving to an as-yet-unspecified date.“One of the things I’m most proud of is that people have said our movie is one you have to see all together,” he wrote. “Well due to the ever-changing circumstances of what’s going on in the world around us, now is clearly not the right time to do that.

Here’s how to spice things upSleepless parents, hard-partying students and anyone who works antisocial hours or is on a tight budget will know that a well-stocked kitchen cupboard is your best friend and that if you look after it, it will look after you. Now, however, the rest of us are getting a reminder, as the coronavirus outbreak forces thousands of us into self-isolation. Here are some ideas for what to cook if you are forced to rely on what you already have, rather than popping to the shops for ingredients.Yotam Ottolenghi once pointed out that there are as many variations on pilaf as there are nations in south and west Asia, the Middle East, India, the Balkans and large swathes of Africa. He was focusing on rice cooked with broth and other ingredients, but the cookbook writer Vicky Boghal has an even simpler go-to using cooked rice. Sautee it briskly with whatever you have to hand: finely chopped veg (fresh or from a can), sliced leftovers, tinned fish or cured meat and a drizzle of oil. To flavour, add your favourite condiment (soy sauce, Marmite, fish sauce, ketchup), spices (cumin, coriander), pickles (capers, jalapenos), dried fruit or herbs (dried parsley, thyme, rosemary) and a splash of water, and cover to steam for 10 minutes. Finish with seeds (I like sesame), fresh herbs if you have any or chopped nuts. Just to prove how eminently adaptable this dish is, Nigel Slater makes a bacon and mushroom version with bulgur wheat in place of rice: even the grain can be replaced ...Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing have perfected cooking from basics. Their pizza base mixes 160g self-raising flour with 150g Greek yoghurt, some salt and some cumin. But the Awesome Green’s vegan version will do just as well – 230g whole wheat flour mixed with 125 ml water, 1 tbsp oil, salt and nigella or some other kind of seed. Knead into a dough, then halve and roll out to the size of an oven-proof frying pan (or else transfer once fried to a baking sheet). Heat the oven to 220C (200C fan)425Fgas mark 7, and heat your frying pan on a high heat. Once hot, add a tiny splash of oil and carefully place the rolled-out dough in it. Fry on both sides for about five minutes, then top with whatever you have on your shelves. Pesto, tomato paste, even ketchup will work olives, capers, tinned peppers or aubergine any grated cheese, any cured meat. Transfer to the oven and bake for five to 10 minutes.The writer and campaigner Jack Monroe is, of course, the undisputed queen of cooking with canned goods, and not out of affectation. Her resourcefulness is exemplary, as demonstrated in this bootstrap chilli (to serve four), adapted from a Gordon Ramsay beef dish. Drain and rinse two cans of beans (Monroe uses red kidney and baked beans – you could try any others, or cook your own from scratch. The website Serious Eats says you can cook 130g of dry beans in place of a standard 400g tin). Cover with water and boil for 10 minutes, then simmer until soft. In a pan, fry some chopped onion in oil with cumin and paprika (hot sauce and dried or fresh chilli would work, too). Add a tin of chopped tomatoes, a stock cube and a splash of red wine. Add the drained beans and some dark chocolate and stir to combine. Serve with rice, or cold in a burrito, and any add-ons you have lying around: more hot sauce or salsa, jalapenos, sour cream or Greek yoghurt, fresh green leaves, grated cheddar …Author Emily Han has made this with every kind of bread. Arrange torn pieces of bread in a buttered baking dish and sprinkle with your choice of dried fruit (candied ginger, golden raisins, dates, you name it) and nuts. Pour over a mixture of one can of coconut milk (or other plant milk), three eggs (3 tbsp flax or chia seeds mixed with 9 tbsp water are a handy vegan substitute), sugar (Han’s recipe says 200g, which is a lot replace with honey, maple syrup, jam or date syrup to the quantity you are comfortable with), sweet spice (cardamom goes wonderfully with pistachios), vanilla if you like it and a pinch of salt. Bake at 170C (150C fan)325Fgas mark 3 for 45 minutes.Dried noodles are the perfect quick fix, as Fuchsia Dunlop puts it. All you need is something to make a sauce (oil, salt and heat), and something crunchy to put on top. She has an excellently simplified version of a Sichuan sauce (to serve four) mixing 4 tbsp peanut butter (in place of sesame you could easily substitute with tahini or another nut butter) with 2 ½ tbsp soy sauce and a dash of vinegar (she uses Chinkiang, but says red wine vinegar works fine, too). She mixes in oil (chilli and sesame olive would work just as well, with chilli flakes, chopped fresh chilli or a dash of hot sauce) and minced garlic, and whisks with enough stock or water to get the consistency of single cream. Cook four servings of noodles to packet instructions, then drain and ide between four bowls, top with the sauce, chopped chives or spring onions if you have any and a sprinkling of sesame seeds or chopped cashews. Tinned fish would add bulk, as would any finely sliced salad vegetables (cucumber, tomato, celery, lettuce).Slater does an excellent pumpkin dish that could work just as well with butternut squash or sweet potato. Fry 800g of chopped squash with some oil until golden brown. Remove then fry a chopped onion until brown, stir in some tomato puree, add a tin of chopped tomatoes, a canful of water and season with the spice or dried herb of your choice (he uses oregano thyme, parsley, rosemary or fennel would be lovely, too, as would cumin, coriander etc) and salt and pepper. Return the squash to the pan and simmer until soft – about 25 minutes. Serve with some kind of grain (bread, pasta, rice) and top with what you like: a dollop of something creamy, hot sauce or chilli flakes, fresh herbs, green leaves, a squeeze of lemon …One of the most adaptable things around : you need a base (cooked potato or sweet potato, mashed carrots or beans, tofu), bulk (cooked grains, more veg, chopped nuts, breadcrumbs) and flavour (spices, cheese, herbs, onion, garlic, lemon zest, seeds). Mix to obtain something that holds together nicely, then shape into balls and flatten before refrigerating for one hour. Heat some oil in a pan and fry for three to four minutes on both sides. Serve as you would a burger pattie.Meera Sodha’s vegan take on the sticky Swedish kladdkaka is mouthwatering. Being vegan, it uses dry goods and longlife or make-your-own milk substitutes: to 160ml heated olive oil you add 100g dark vegan chocolate to melt. Then mix in 200g plain flour, 200g caster sugar, 60g cocoa powder, some salt, some vanilla extract, 175ml almond milk and some fruit. Sodha uses the pulp of three passion fruit, which is about 3 tbsp I would try with the same amount of mashed banana, orange juice, yoghurt or nut butter – or just omit it entirely and see what happens kladdkaka is famous for being forgiving. Mix until smooth then pour into a lined cake tin and bake for 25 minutes at 200C (180C fan)400Fgas mark 6 or until a knife comes out clean.Ottolenghi makes this from scratch, cooking dried chickpeas with some cinnamon and dried chilli. You could just as easily make it with drained canned chickpeas, and add the spice with the other ingredients: garlic, cumin and coriander seeds, tomato paste, harissa (or other chilli paste), some olive oil and season with salt and pepper and some water. Bring to the boil then simmer until the chickpeas are as soft as you would like – add water as necessary. Before serving, add some lemon juice (fresh or bottled vinegar works too). Serve with poached eggs (I would just as soon add feta or some other fresh cheese, if I had any), bread to dip and extra harissa and olive oil.It is worth remembering how you can make a good spag bol without any meat. Anna Jones adds canned puy lentils to a tomato sauce made with onion, garlic, celery, carrot and one tin each of chopped tomatoes and tomato soup. To which, as she says, you could add pretty much any veg you find in your fridge. Serve with grated parmesan, fried breadcrumbs or fresh herbs.• This article was amended on 12 March 2020. The Jack Monroe recipe for chilli calls for dark chocolate, but not specifically “dark vegan chocolate” as an earlier version said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b42eab9a8e1c78dc94268510e2af5d66a50a8cf2/31_198_2532_1519/master/2532.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=533d1c29af1791baa013f950b238afd3","title":"the fiver liverpool big cup atletico","story":"Sign up now!

Proper football! And there’s nothing more proper in football than doing the properest thing of all, which is properly putting the ball in the net in order to declare yourselves the proper winners. And The Fiver is fairly sure Atlético Madrid did that three times on Wednesday night – it counted a well-executed move after Adrián’s error, a sweet finish and then a clinical breakaway – and thus scored three proper goals to Liverpool’s two proper goals. Did they deserve it? That depends on what matters to you. Did they win? That depends on the thing that matters the most, objectively, so yes they did.Atlético might be good at our definition of proper football but they can’t be much cop at proper anti-football, which The Fiver always thought amounted to throwing a blanket over the thing with a few Emmanuel Adebayor-style kung-fu kicks thrown in. But then there was something odd in the water all night and it clearly got to Diego Simeone, usually pugnacious to a fault, when he modestly offered up the idea that Liverpool had been unlucky to be denied the extra 30 minutes Atlético had received to score a few proper football away goals. It is a kink in the system for sure but, look, they’ll pull through.Perhaps what upset Klopp the most is that, after two season finales that have built up to a crescendo, this one – coronavirus or no coronavirus – looks like fizzling out in a slightly odd way. Liverpool are brilliant and will win the league: nobody is about to argue with that. But the high-adrenaline Anfield days and nights that really get the old place going – the ones where miracles are made and the rest of the world can do one – will have to wait for a while now, and the Klopp era had brought back a heady diet of those. In the end, though, Liverpool could field 11 Adriáns and still parade the Premier League trophy in front of their fans – or at least the seats they’ve purchased – before the season’s end. They’ll have done enough to win and that, in the end, is what proper football looks like.

Lego Super Mario is being described as a product line rather than one-off.As shown in a promotional video, the interactive Mario figure collects coins in physical game levels created with Lego bricks. It’s also likely that he will be able to interact in other ways, and perhaps collect other items that power-up his collecting skills: we see him collect a heart and panic when placed on a flame tile.The ability to design these levels in some way promises greater involvement for players. With the smart Lego Super Mario figure, it may be possible to add time limits and sequential challenges to the courses that users make. The concept can be seen as an extension of the Super Mario Maker games, which allow players to design their own levels.Interestingly, there is no sign of tablet or smartphone interaction. Parents may well approve of this, but it seems unlikely that the Lego Mario technology will not connect to other devices in some way – perhaps via a related app similarly to the recent NFC-enabled Minecraft toys from Mattel. The Bluetooth button on the back of the toy would seem to suggest this kind of connectivity.This toy-meets-video-game market used to be known as “toys-to-life”, when the Skylanders video game launched in 2011 with its range of related figurines. Since then, there have been many smart toy ideas (including the impressive Lego Dimensions) but few have had sustained success.The Lego Super Mario sets seem to be aimed at a younger crowd, of around five- to nine-year-olds. This raises questions of how collaborative the interactions will be: will Lego Super Mario be something users play on their own or will it be possible to compete and collaborate with friends who also have their own Lego Super Mario, as with the recent Hotwheels iD cars and playsets?This is the latest in a recent series of Lego video-game innovations. Last year it released Lego Brawls, a Super Smash Bros-style game, on Apple Arcade along with the augmented-reality video game Lego Hidden Side.Nintendo’s influence is evident in the marketing of the new Lego sets. Rather than being launched at the New York Toy Fair, the industry’s biggest trade fair, Lego Super Mario has been revealed through digital channels.More will be revealed nearer to the launch, scheduled for later this year. Particularly important will be the price of the sets and how they work together to offer increased value. As we’ve seen with previous toys-to-life franchises, which have often been flooded with add-ons and accessories, the market is sensitive to cost, especially given that popular titles such as Fortnite are often free to start playing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ce14eacdd97a6dc0ba3ad88afde2539358e6fbb7/0_79_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fdd46d9bfd679e3da6a335ddbc03877","title":"list of worlds worst digital predators stretches from india and brazil to us","story":"Freedom of expression group names and shames alleged offenders on online censorship and orchestrated repressionA freedom of expression group has launched a list of “digital predators”, ranking what it says are 20 of the world’s worst offenders for cyber-censorship and orchestrated online repression.Published on Thursday by Reporters Without Borders (RSF) to coincide with World Day Against Cyber-Censorship, the list names and shames entities around the globe whose activities it regards as “tantamount to preying on journalism”.It documents state and non-state actors allegedly responsible for what the group describes as “a clear danger for freedom of opinion and expression” guaranteed by article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.RSF classifies the digital predators under four broad headings: harassment, state censorship, disinformation and spying or surveillance. The inventory includes authoritarian regimes and private-sector companies, based in western countries such as the US, UK, Germany and Israel, specialising in software that can be used for targeted cyber-espionage.“The authoritarian strongmen behind predatory activity against press freedom are extending their tentacles into the digital world with the help of armies of accomplices, subordinates and henchmen who are organised and determined digital predators,” said Christophe Deloire, RSF’s secretary general.“We have decided to publish this list of 20 digital predators in order not only to expose another aspect of press freedom violations but also to draw attention to the fact that these accomplices sometimes act from or within democratic countries.“Opposition to despotic regimes also means ensuring that the weapons for suppressing journalism are not delivered to them from abroad,” he added, referring to British, German and Swiss companies allegedly involved in supplying intrusive software to abusers.While some of the entities and methods listed – such as those linked to the Kremlin, Tehran and China – are well documented, including the aggressive use of troll farms, online spying and disinformation, the report describes how such digital control methods are becoming more and more widespread.Among case studies documented is that of Rana Ayyub, an Indian journalist who wrote the Gujarat Files, a book about Narendra Modi’s rise to power. In the book, Ayyub looks at how the Indian prime minister has become a prominent target of “Yoddhas” – online trolls who either volunteer their services or are paid employees of the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party.The report also focuses on the alleged existence of a “hate office” in the administration of Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro. First revealed by Joice Hasselmann, a parliamentarian and former ally of Bolsonaro, the office reportedly consists of presidential advisers and is coordinated by the president’s son, Carlos. It publishes attacks against journalists on a large scale, including Glenn Greenwald, the former  journalist, now of the Intercept, who has published revelations about Bolsonaro.The report also looks at the state-sponsored social media “reinformation” campaign run by Vietnam’s ministry of public security. An army of 10,000 cyber-soldiers, its ostensible role is to combat online “abuses” and “reactionary forces” – in reality meaning those opposed to the government.It gives as an example a deadly raid on a village known as Dong Tam in January this year, in which the actions of the police were widely criticised. Social media was flooded with forced confessions from those accused of being involved, apparently in an effort to distract criticism.Also on the list is Zerodium, a US-based cybersecurity firm that, according to RSF, obtains information about vulnerabilities in widely-used software from hackers and security researchers before selling it on to third parties."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8dc949d6f98cd171547a0f954f67049043dde5a9/0_0_2283_1370/master/2283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7a2d5618ac92c4b4d772c5f616d1a32","title":"prince harry youve been pranked or is the joke on us","story":"It’s being portrayed as the Duke of Sussex falling victim to a hoax phone calls. But the truth could be far more sinisterI was a remarkably strange, earnest, rule-abiding 10-year-old, so when we received a prank call to the house once, I didn’t immediately realise it was happening. I don’t think it hit me that it was a prank until I was deep into my 20s. I assumed that the voice on the other end of the phone asking, “Is your washing machine running?” was a representative of Hotpoint making a legitimate follow-up survey call after a vaguely recent purchase. I had to walk all the way downstairs to find my mum, who it turns out was in the bathroom, to ask her. I knocked on the door.“Is the washing machine running?”“What? I can’t hear you.”“Who wants to know?”“Man on the phone.”“A man on the phone wants to know about our washing machine?”“Well tell him ‘Yes’ then!”Then I trudged all the way upstairs again, to someone who had set out two minutes ago to make a harmless prank call and was now frantically coining 20p pieces into a public phone box to hear how this saga ended, and picked up the phone. “She says yes,” I said, dutifully, and then, with the expectation of generations behind him, with a breath held for hours before him in anticipation, with the raw earthly power of the wind itself, he shouted: “WELL BEST GET RUNNING AFTER IT THEN!” and hung up. I was utterly, thoroughly owned.Solidarity, then, with the Artist Formerly Known As Prince Harry, who, it emerged this week, was allegedly the victim of a prank phone call from Russia’s Ant and Dec equivalent, Vovan and Lexus (Vladimir Kuznetsov and Alexey Stolyarov). Actually, I suspect they are possibly more like Russia’s JK \u0026amp Joel. Anyway, they somehow duped him into thinking he was on a conference call with Greta Thunberg and her father, Svante, twice over Christmas and New Year. The calls were released online this week and, honestly, they are … fine? They are less embarrassing than interrogating your mum about white goods, as a random example.Here a few selected excerpts. President Donald Trump has “blood on his hands” due to his continuing tubthumping of the US coal industry. Getting married into the royal family is “not all it’s made out to be”. Boris Johnson is a “good man, so you are one of few people who can reach into his soul and get him to feel and believe in you”. On the Sussexes having a private jet habit: “Unfortunately, there are very few alternatives”. On Prince Andrew having a private jet habit: “I have very little to say on that. But whatever he has done or hasn’t done is completely separate from me and my wife.” He rounded the phone call out by saying: “I was in the military for 10 years, so I’m more normal than my family would like to believe.” Which I think is pushing it a bit. There are literally four career paths available to former members of the British army – bullish Apprentice contestant murderer hidden homeless ignored by the government and Nervous Man At Public Fireworks Display. Harry has about a week and a half to decide which of them he is going to take up.Read the headlines on Harry taking a phone call in good faith from a prominent climate activist and proceeding to have a mild conversation that was so watertight it could’ve run on The One Show as a “bit” and you would see it as an enormous “Gotcha!” That Harry – who dared to leave a royal family he was never going to be the king of simply because existence within its ancient structures is deeply horrible – was a spoilt brat who, seconds after announcing his exit, let the artifice slip and started blabbing family secrets to anyone who could reach his incredibly secure line at his safe house in Canada. Or you might see it as an agenda pushed by a media that got chided by the same man for aggressively pushing a witch-hunt against his wife: I don’t know. The cynic in me, though – the one born the second he put that phone down as a child, who in that moment learned never to believe anything again – thinks this is all an act.Think about it. Harry has left the royal family to a mixed response (you fall into one of two camps: you either think leaving an ancient institution on mental health and limelight-pressure grounds into a life of guaranteed wealth and family bliss is a good idea, or you Extremely Care About Whether The Taxpayer Still Funds His Security Detail). He needs a PR win. What better way to woo the young, hip, always-online crowd than by speaking their language, of YouTube pranks, diplomatic “see all sides” opinions about world leaders, sincere wife-guy expressions of love and all the right noises about the climate crisis? Being pranked by Russians was arguably the best thing he could have done for his career at this point.My only fear is that this will result in the remaining members of the royal family trying to get in on the “speaking the language of online” trend, in a bid to out-Harry Harry. William tries to do the Say So TikTok dance in front of an assembly full of year 6 children, or something. Kate Middleton does a lacklustre smoky-eye beauty tutorial. Prince Charles makes one of those vile Instagram cooking videos which consists of just his knobbly hands seen holding a tray of Duchy of Cornwall butter to melt it over an induction hob and then mixing it with ribboned hotdogs. Prince Andrew gets caught slowly licking his lips on Chaturbate. It’s a perilous new era for Britain’s favourite family. Let’s see where they go with it.Tom Hanks and his wife, Rita Wilson, have become the first A-list celebrities to test positive for coronavirus. You have to assume there are various Hollywood-adjacent WhatsApp groups currently seething about this news: it’s just so Tom Hanks of Tom Hanks to be the guy to get coronavirus, isn’t it? First he has an entire career of impeccable award-winning acting. Then he is universally embraced as the ultimate nice guy, like one of those footballers who somehow goes their whole career without a single yellow card. And now he gets to be the first big coronavirus scalp while filming an Elvis biopic in Australia. That is just … so Hanksian, isn’t it? He probably got it after too-close contact with an infected typewriter. Tom Hanks never stops being Tom Hanks, even for one second.All the more odd, then, that his son Chet announced the news with a topless Instagram video in which Chet appears huge, hulking and tattooed like the back of a dollar bill, the leg day-skipping gym receptionist who ghosts you to end all other leg day-skipping gym receptionists who ghost you. He leads with: “What’s up everyone, uh, yeah, uh, it’s true my parents got coronavirus. Crazy.”If you are unfamiliar with Chet Hanks, I must urge you to swim deep down the rabbit hole of him over your next month of self-isolation: as a human being, he is fascinating as the direct descendant of the world’s nicest man, he is doubly so as an example of how mind-bending it must be to grow up the son of one of the planet’s most famous actors, he is a cautionary tale.He last made headlines for dropping a bizarrely competent patois accent at the Golden Globes (I won’t transcribe the whole thing, but “Big up, big up the whole island massive, it’s your boy Chet coming straight from the Golden Globes” features heavily). And now he is dropping Tom Hanks Health Updates in the form of Instagram thirst traps. I am obsessed. “I just got off the phone with them,” Chet concluded. “They both are fine, they’re not even that sick. They’re not worried about it, they’re not tripping, but they’re going through the necessary health precautions, obviously.” Guys, please don’t worry. Tom Hanks is not tripping. But if you are worried about him, please slide into Chet Hanks’s DMs, where you will be welcomed warmly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aafe054e0d735088ba4968ed9626886f46fd28e0/0_41_6048_3630/master/6048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d43957441629b8f0fc9174b2d3a9793","title":"three more travel insurers withdraw coronavirus cover aviva post office insureandgo","story":"Aviva, InsureandGo and Post Office follow LV after WHO declares virus is pandemicThe travel insurers Aviva, InsureandGo and the Post Office have followed LV and withdrawn cover for future coronavirus claims.LV shocked the travel industry on Wednesday night when it announced that it would stop selling all travel insurance policies with immediate effect due to the coronavirus outbreak.The insurance giant Aviva said on Thursday that it had halted all single-trip direct travel insurance for new customers travelling to Italy “to reflect the current risks posed by coronavirus”.Customers buying cover for trips to other destinations will no longer be able to select its “travel disruption” or “airspace closure” add-ons, Aviva said.The move has been prompted by the World Health Organization declaration of a pandemic, and is likely to be followed by other insurers. It means that anyone who has not already bought cover for future holidays will be unlikely to be able to get coronavirus cover.The Post Office said it would continue to sell travel insurance policies but there is no longer cover provided for any claims related to Covid-19 for policies purchased after 11 March 2020 – the date of the WHO’s a pandemic announcement.It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus\u0026nbspcan be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is\u0026nbspavailable here.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 9 March,\u0026nbspmore than 110,000 people have been infected\u0026nbspin more than 80 countries, according to the\u0026nbspJohns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have\u0026nbspover 3,800 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland\u0026nbspChina.\u0026nbsp62,000 people have recovered\u0026nbspfrom the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic.InsureandGo, owned by Mapfre, said on Thursday morning that customers who bought a policy after 11.59pm on 11 March will not be able to make any claim relating to the virus. Travellers who bought policies from all the firms prior to 11 March will be able to bring claims as before, the Association of British Insurers (ABI) said.The Post Office said it was monitoring the situation very closely and would update its travel alerts webpage with the latest information for policy holders.“Insurance is designed to provide cover for unforeseen and unexpected events and is priced on this basis. The outbreak of the Coronavirus means there is an increased likelihood of disruption to people’s travel plans. We envisage that these decisions, affecting only Aviva’s travel insurance new business, will be temporary actions,” said an Aviva spokeswoman.As the coronavirus outbreak has spiralled out of control travellers and insurers have watched on with increasing horror. Travel insurance cancellation typically only kicks in when the Foreign Office advises against all but essential travel to a country. Travel disruption cover will sometimes step in, but it is limited and often absent from the cheaper policies.Travellers faced with flight cancellations, lockdowns, and a growing list of countries refusing entry to tourists have found to their cost that they are not covered.If the UK government advised against all but essential travel to, say, Spain the cost of claims would likely send some insurers to the brink. Despite this, the number of people buying travel insurance rose sharply last month.An ABI spokesperson said: “Existing policies remain unaffected. Travel insurance for new customers remains widely available, so people should shop around for the cover that best meets their needs. In a competitive insurance market, insurers will be monitoring carefully the fast-moving developments in the coronavirus outbreak, and will keep their position under constant review as the situation develops."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/32099f6f6e2989419d7370f87f85509367d0575a/83_31_2956_1774/master/2956.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64162ece67951951afd20913933cb2be","title":"the labour leadership interviews lisa nandy","story":"The Labour leadership candidate Lisa Nandy speaks to Anushka Asthana.

But not in every way.”Shapps said dynamic hard shoulders were confusing. Such motorways, on which the hard shoulder operates only part-time and is a live running lane the rest of the time, will be converted to all-lane running – with refuge areas instead of a hard shoulder – by 2025.Motoring organisations said the moves were a “victory for common sense and safety”.A review was launched by the Department for Transport after revelations that there had been a spike in near-misses on converted sections of the M25, compared with conventional motorways.A former transport minister who signed off the policy to build more smart motorways also called for their rollout to be halted, saying commitments on safety had been ignored. Mike Penning cited “harrowing” evidence from the deaths of drivers who had broken down in live traffic and were killed in crashes while awaiting help.At least 38 people have died on stretches of smart motorways in the past five years, and motoring organisations believe a number of those deaths were avoidable.Other measures announced to improve safety included:“No driver wants to be stuck in a live lane with nowhere to go at best it is incredibly distressing, at worst it can be fatal. We believe the intention to place emergency refuge areas at every three-quarters of a mile is a great outcome and what we have called for over the last decade.”But the RAC gave a mixed reaction, describing the end of dynamic hard shoulders as a “red herring”, given that such systems represented a fraction of the network.Its head of roads policy, Nicholas Lyes, said: “Two-thirds of drivers tell us they believe permanently removing the hard shoulder compromises safety in the event of a breakdown.“While it is welcome that the government has listened to their concerns and undertaken this review, it remains to be seen whether these measures go far enough to protect drivers who are unfortunate enough to break down in live lanes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b81e16b68461f1e98adc7880126a9c42005a4ad8/0_77_1763_1058/master/1763.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cecdf049df7dbdade931d4f774c89358","title":"seven alternatives to skiing on your winter holiday","story":"Never mind the après-ski pros, even true powder hunters need a break from the slopes every now and then. Here are seven great options for going off pisteWhen you head off for your winter mountain break, it’s likely that either skiing or snowboarding is the main thing on your mind. However, most ski resorts offer a wealth of other activities that you can enjoy on bad weather days, in the evenings, or simply because you fancy a change from whizzing down the mountain.“More and more people are coming to us who want to do more than just skiing,” says Gilles Meyer, chef de village (resort manager) at Club Med Les Arcs Panorama resort in the French Alps. “It’s been a real trend over the past five years. They come to ski, but they also want to enjoy moments and experiences that aren’t skiing.”So if you’re looking to give the slopes the slip for an afternoon, here are seven alternative activities to try.Dog sleddingMeet the musher and their huskies or Alaskan malamutes and enjoy an exhilarating ride through a beautiful landscape pulled by these highly-trained and lovable dogs. “It’s a nice experience for the whole family. It’s a very green activity and suitable for everyone – you can even take your baby,” says Meyer.Snow mountain bikingRiding a “fat bike”, with extra-wide tyres to help keep your grip on the snow, means mountain biking is no longer strictly a summer activity. Suitable for just about anyone who can ride a bike, some resorts also offer snow mountain e-biking to make going uphill just as easy as coming down.Go to a yoga classYoga can help with your strength, balance and confidence on the slopes and is both an excellent way to prepare for the day ahead, as well as wind down at the end of it. Many Club Med resorts offer yoga classes several times a day as part of their all-inclusive package.Go to the spaThe mountains are the perfect place to enjoy a spa experience, whether you’ve been out on the slopes and want to ease your aching muscles, or are simply looking to relax. Some have hot tubs or heated pools, where you can comfortably be outside in the water even as the snow falls. “People love to have a body treatment after skiing. We have 13 spa treatment cabins here in Les Arcs,” Meyer says.Ice skatingMost resorts have an outdoor rink, and some have an indoor one too, making skating an excellent all-weather activity. Skates are available for hire, and many venues offer portable supports to make it easier for even small children to have a go. Some resorts also offer lessons if you or your children want to have a go at figure skating, and in some places you can even skate on a natural lake or pond.Enjoy a wine tasting sessionMany areas with good skiing also produce interesting wine. Even if they don’t, some restaurants and bars offer sessions for people who want to learn more about wine, led by a sommelier. At Club Med, the wine-tasting sessions are led by a sommelier in a dedicated area of the cosy gourmet lounges. Sessions throughout the week focus on local wines, French wines and wines from around the world.Nordic walking and snowshoeingEven if you don’t want to ski or snowboard, there are still plenty of ways to get out on the mountain and enjoy the scenery. For Nordic walking, all you need is some decent walking boots and some special walking poles – it’s a great way to keep fit and get out in the fresh air. Snowshoeing is usually a slower-paced option. “Snowshoeing is for people who want to be outside in nature, seeing the animals, to walk and to relax. You can be in the powder and it’s nice and easy for everyone,” says Meyer.Club Med, founded in 1950, is the pioneer of the all-inclusive concept, offering nearly 70 premium resorts in stunning locations around the world including North and South America, Caribbean, Asia, Africa, Europe and the Mediterranean."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d68ae17a75fbbedb4fa08caeee2908ccc53fb98/0_236_4128_2477/master/4128.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3fc24aaba519a241b48ff02cf4b89fa","title":"coronavirus most infections spread by people yet to show symptoms scientists","story":"Findings mean that isolating people once they start to feel ill is less effective than hopedThe majority of coronavirus infections may be spread by people who have recently caught the virus and have not yet begun to show symptoms, scientists have found.An analysis of infections in Singapore and Tianjin in China revealed that two-thirds and three-quarters of people respectively appear to have caught it from others who were incubating the virus but still symptom-free.The finding has dismayed infectious disease researchers as it means that isolating people once they start to feel ill will be far less effective at slowing the pandemic than had been hoped.“This is one of the first things we were worried about when the outbreak began,” said Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics at Imperial College London, who was not involved in the work. “It was certainly unhoped for. This is one thing we really didn’t want to go this way.”Researchers in Belgium and the Netherlands drew on data from outbreaks in Singapore and Tianjin to work out the “generation interval” for Covid-19. The generation interval is the time between one person getting infected and them infecting another. The figure is valuable for estimating the speed at which an outbreak will unfold.The mean generation interval was 5.2 days in the Singapore cluster and 3.95 days in the China cluster, according to the analysis which is under review at an infectious disease journal. The scientists went on to calculate what proportion of infections were likely spread from people who were still incubating the virus and had yet to develop symptoms.There are uncertainties in the figures because the scientists did not have precise information on who infected whom in the two clusters of disease. But even the lowest estimates show there was substantial transmission of coronavirus from people who had yet to fall ill.Tapiwa Ganyani, a researcher on the team, said the numbers suggest that isolating sick people would not be enough to quell the outbreak. “It is unlikely that these measures alone will suffice to control the Covid-19 epidemic,” he said. “Additional measures, such as social distancing, are required.”The finding confirms recent comments from Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the World Health Organization’s emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, who said preliminary data showed patients shed more virus in the early stages of the disease, including when presymptomatic. A separate study that tracked nine patients in Germany found that levels of the virus might already be in decline when symptoms come on.“The number helps us estimate how likely certain kinds of public health interventions are to work,” said Riley. “If you ask people to go home when they feel ill and they have infected half the people they are going to infect before they feel ill, then you know you are not going to get rid of those transmissions.” But he said it was still important to isolate those with symptoms, even if it would not be enough to stop the outbreak.Ganyani stressed that the study looked at outbreaks where quarantine and other containment measures were already in place, which inflates the proportion of infections from presymptomatic people. “If control measures are less strict you would expect this estimate to be lower, but the number of secondary cases to be higher on average,” he said.Rowland Kao, who studies infectious disease dynamics at the University of Edinburgh, said: “One of the factors that has distinguished this coronavirus pandemic from the Sars epidemic in 2003, is that Sars was infectious only after the development of clinical signs, which made it relatively easier to control. For the current pandemic, from very early on it was suspected that a substantial number of transmissions were arising before clinical signs appeared.“What is important to know is that, in their analysis, isolation can play an important and possibly crucial role but needs to be supplemented by other measures,” he added.Additional reporting by Hannah Devlin"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e49d7c63140c17170889fe19ef4e4d5815f581f8/151_0_4489_2695/master/4489.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6686de633b0078c4a85e43bb273bcf23","title":"cheltenham festival 2020 all the latest news from day three live","story":"It’s as you were with One Style leading from Thomas Mahler ...

Every horse has two or three staff to accompany it, who will return to a country on lockdown on Friday evening. Yet as all this was happening elsewhere, the enclosures were filling with around 65,000 racegoers, many of whom will be back again on Friday on their annual pilgrimage to watch steeplechasing’s championship event.Read on ... It has been announced that horse racing in Ireland will take place behind closed doors until March 29th at the earliest. There will be no crowds or caterers at the courses and the number of grooms and trainers permitted at each meeting will be kept to the bare minimum.  Already a winner at this Festival, Jamie Codd returns to the fray for what has been his most fruitful race. The amateur has won this four times in the past 11 years and teams up again with Le Breuil, on whom he won the National Hunt Chase last year. He hasn’t won this season but that was also true for nine of the last 12 Kim Muir winners.Deise Aba is probably ahead of the handicapper, following his Sandown win on just his fourth start over fences, though whether he is quite quick enough for this is open to question. Fingerontheswitch is having a grand season but is flying up the weights in consequence. Fitzhenry is a JP McManus horse who looks nicely treated on the best of his form, like his Troytown second.Champagne Platinum is a JPNicky Henderson horse who stayed on well at the end of the Scilly Isles to be third.

Here’s a funny thing, a race that has only ever been won by Willie Mullins (it’s only been run four times) and yet some other trainer somehow has the favourite. Minella Melody occupies that position for Henry de Bromhead, having won a key trial in January, beating Colreevy. She is unbeaten over hurdles and looks classy.Concertista, whose odds halved to 5-1 during Wednesday, was beaten just a short-head in this race a year ago, her first start over hurdles. She was third in a big-field handicap last time, form which looks solid. Floressa represents the in-form Nicky Henderson and was a bit unlucky last time.

Lisnagar Oscar caused a 50-1 upset as reigning champion Paisley Park disappointed in the Paddy Power Stayers’ Hurdle at Cheltenham.Making smooth progress on the near side, Lisnager Oscar hit the front before the final flight in the hands of Adam Wedge, to put trainer Rebecca Curtis back in the big time.Lisnagar Oscar galloped on strongly up the hill to hold the challenge of Ronald Pump (20-1) by two lengths, with Bacardys (33-1) a further three lengths away in third place.Apple’s Jade had set a decent gallop and opened up a big led until she came back to the field after the third-last flight.The runners bunched up, with several horses in with a chance two out, but it was Lisnagar Oscar who proved strongest to claim the coveted prize. Last year’s winner Paisley Park looked to be in trouble some way out and faded to finish seventh.“Unbelievable, it’s fantastic,” said Wedge, the winning jockey. “The little horse has tried his heart out. I couldn’t believe it when I hit the front, I was just praying he’d keep galloping - he fought like a little lion up that hill.”Simply The Betts is the obvious one, having improved so much as a chaser this term, and the form of his win here in January was boosted by the runner-up scoring here on Tuesday. Novices like him have a good record and have won this twice in the past three years.Happy Diva won the BetVictor here in November but has no secrets from the handicapper. Sirruh Du Lac made all to win this last year and may have had his excuses for a November flop, his only run since. La Bague Au Roi doesn’t look badly treated for this switch to handicaps. Oldgrangewood is a strong finisher who seems likely to get the strong pace that he needs.Lisnagar Oscar pulls off a huge shock in the Stayers’ Hurdle. It’s a maiden Festival win for jockey Adam Wedge, who wins for trainer Rebecca Curtis. Lisnagar Oscar leads over the last from Bacardys, who comes with a strong run. Lisnagar Oscar wins at 50-1 ...

Always in the front rank, the Willie Mullins-trained nine-year-old held the late challenge of Saint Calvados to take Grade One honours under Paul Townend.Min, owned by Rich Ricci, was accompanied by Frodon up front in the early stages until last year’s winner started to lose touch, although he kept going for fourth. Shattered Love and Aso were others unable to keep pace with Min, who turned up the tempo with Riders Onthe Storm falling three out when trying to get into contention. A Plus Tard laid it down to Min (2-1) from that point, but the 7-4 favourite could not find what was needed from the final fence. Saint Calvados was the last to challenge but the post came in time for Min, who crossed the line a neck to the good. A Plus Tard was a length and a half back in third.Paisley Park was a hugely popular winner last year and has not been beaten since, most recently pushing past Summerville Boy in the Cleeve here in January. Judging by last year, he’ll be settled in midfield, which brings the risk of trouble in running, and his stable has been gradually dropping out of form since November. However, it’s not always wise to pay attention to stable form when you’re considering top-class horses, I’ve found.Summerville Boy has not built on his Supreme win from two years ago but he ran well on his first try at this distance in the Cleeve and may have more to offer. City Island returns to hurdles for the first time since last season, when he beat Champ in the Ballymore. Emitom slogged through the Haydock mud to win the Rendlesham last month, but that hasn’t been an influential trial.Penhill, the 2018 winner, seems to be working his way back to form. L’Ami Serge has masses of talent but often would rather hide it under a bushel and would be the oldest winner since 1986. Apple’s Jade also seems to have lost her enthusiasm for the game, though she ran to a high standard at Christmas and blinkers may help. Richard Johnson is a surprising booking, with Davy Russell unused.If you backed Aso you can throw your ticket away. Ditto for Riders OnThye DStorm, who’s a faller. Min leads by a neck from A Plus Tard with one to jump. Over the last they go and Saint Calvados tries to get past Min on the rail before switching to the outside ... Min wins by a neck from Saint Calvados ... Min wins the Ryanair Chase under a fine ride from Paul Townend for Willie Mullins. Min leads from Shattered Love, Aso and A Plus Tard. Frodon gets a shake of the reins from Bryony Frost to wake him up ... Aso is now being scrubbed along with four to jump. A Plus Tard is being scrubbed along by Rachael Blackmore ... Min leads by a neck from Frodon with Shattered Love making it three abreast across the front. Now Aso gets upside them, while Frodon is a couple of lengths off the pace. They’ve nine to jump and they’re all still standing ... Away they go in the Ryanair Chase, with last year’s winner Frodon making the pace under Bryony Frost. Min and Paul Townend are second with Shattered Love in third ... Sire Du Berlais led home a Gordon Elliott one-two as he recorded back-to-back victories in the Pertemps Network Final Handicap Hurdle at Cheltenham.Continuing a fine Festival for Elliott as well as jockey Barry Geraghty and owner JP McManus, Sire Du Berlais (10-1) was revitalised by wearing blinkers for the first time.The Storyteller, Sire Du Berlais and Tout Les Permis jumped the last virtually together, and it was the first two from the Elliott stable who pulled away. Sire Du Berlais, carrying top-weight, got on top close home to land the spoils by half a length. Tout Les Permis was six and half lengths away in third place, with Third Wind fourth and Relegate a never-nearer fifth.Some sad news: Copper Gone West, ridden by Alan Johns and trained by Tim Vaughan, was pulled up with an injury during the Pertemps and has since been put down. A Plus Tard is back at the Festival, having hosed up in a handicap last year. He was last seen beating Chacun Pour Soi over Christmas, a fine effort even if the runner-up needed the outing. With the De BromheadBlackmore combination going well, he seems set to run another big race, but dangers abound.Frodon won this last year under a great front-running ride and returned to form last time. Min doesn’t have to face Altior for the first time in four visits to the Festival. It seems timely to recall that he beat Politologue 20 lengths at Aintree last April. Duc Des Genievres has done little since winning a weak Arkle, while Riders Onthe Storm ought to be puggled after his Ascot race last month.Shattered Love is interesting at a big price, having won the Marsh two years ago. She lost her way after that but has had a couple of good moments this winter.Kansas City Chief but Rapper takes over in front with The Storyteller making his move on the outside. Sire Du Berlais flanks the duo. Sire De Berlais wins for Barry Geraghty from The Storyteller. Tout Est Permis is third. Kansas City Chief leads with two hurdles to go ... Burrows Park is in second with Tout Est Permis in third as they go through the gears ... Burrows Park is being pushed along ... Kansas City Chief leads by a length from Burrows Park and Kilbricken Storm ... the bunch is closely packed and they’re all standing ...

There is no evidence to support a link between the two."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e4bb971f4c020cee648eaa57006fe39b1254f1a/250_482_3946_2368/master/3946.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=424167a6f354b1bd249e3a738303dbaa","title":"microsoft surface pro x review not yet ready for prime time","story":"Long battery life, 4G and beautiful design can’t stop it being held back by a lack of apps for its ARM chipThe Surface Pro X is a glimpse of an ARM-powered Windows future, combining the best bits of phones and computers, but while that future is closer than ever, it isn’t quite ready yet.The new £999 Surface Pro X might look like the rest of Microsoft’s Surface tablets on the outside, but it is fundamentally a different beast on the inside.It has a new processor at its heart called the SQ1, which Microsoft partnered with mobile-chip maker Qualcomm to create, instead of a traditional Intel or AMD chip. It is ARM-based, just like the one inside your phone, not an x86 chip, which has been used in most computers for decades.Switching to an ARM system has certain advantages, including potential for longer battery life, built-in 4G and a slimmer profile, but it also complicates things on the software front.The Surface Pro X takes the Surface Pro 6’s design, maximises the screen widthways and shaves off 1.2mm of thickness. The fanless design looks and feels fantastic: solid, thin and exceedingly well-made in black magnesium and glass, the sides nicely sculpted to make them hand-friendly. At 774g it’s not light, but this is a fairly large tablet – the Surface Pro 6 weighs 770-784g, while Apple’s 4G 12.9in iPad Pro weighs 633g.The 13in screen is sharp, gorgeous and responsive, in line with most high-end laptops. The Windows Hello face recognition camera above the screen is simply brilliant, logging you in instantly when you look at it.The kickstand out the back is the best in the business: stable at a wide range of angles then neatly tucked away when not in use. It also hides a compartment for a nano sim and the SSD.There are two USB-C ports and a volume button on the left side of the machine, with the power button and Surface Connect port in the right. Unfortunately there is no headphone socket or microSD card slot, which is disappointing. The front-facing speakers are tiny but surprisingly loud and good for a tablet.The Surface Pro X also supports a new version of Microsoft’s excellent detachable keyboard and a new stylus called the Slim Pen.The keyboard continues to be brilliant, providing excellent backlit typing with good travel and key feel, a smooth and responsive but fairly small trackpad, and the flexibility to use it flat or at an angle. It attaches to the bottom of the tablet with strong magnets and folds all the way around the back of the tablet, out the way, or closes shut on the screen when not in use.If you buy the one with the Slim Pen, it has a neat trick. The new flattened stylus, which worked as well as Microsoft’s excellent standard Surface Pen, magnetically clips into a tray at the base of the keyboard. The tray charges the stylus and hides it away when the keyboard is propped up against the tablet or when closed. It’s one of the smartest storage solutions I’ve seen for something so easy to lose.On paper, ARM chips are on a similar performance level with many traditional laptop x86 processors. But how the Surface Pro X performs is entirely dependent on the program you happen to be using, split between apps that run natively on the ARM architecture and those that don’t, which are then relegated to running in a 32-bit x86 emulation layer.Performance is, unsurprisingly, night and day. Apps that are ARM-native absolutely fly along. Microsoft’s new Chromium-based Edge browser is a prime example, performing just as well on the Surface Pro X with 30 tabs open as it does on a top-spec desktop PC with a traditional Intel processor. The same goes for most of Microsoft’s Windows apps, except Office, which is still x86.Apps that aren’t ARM-native operate as if you have the handbrake on. Google’s Chrome browser is a great example. It uses the same underlying Chromium technology as Microsoft’s Edge browser but doesn’t have an ARM-native version, so is slow and ponderous. Evernote is equally slow, but tolerable.Simple text editors, such as Typora, run perfectly fine as a 32-bit app, but are noticeably slower than when used on a Surface Pro 6.The other wrinkle is that Windows can only emulate 32-bit x86, not the more performant 64-bit. While some programs have 32-bit versions, many do not, such as Signal or Google’s Gsuite Chat. One big missing area is photo editing, where none of the top photo editors have ARM or 32-bit, including Affinity Photo or any of Adobe’s Creative Cloud.Adobe says it is working on ARM-native Creative Cloud and other apps, but at the time of writing only the cut-down Photoshop Express is available, and even that is 32-bit x86 and therefore incredibly slow.In terms of general computing performance, the Surface Pro X handled a multi-monitor setup just fine, including a 4K 60Hz display via a Surface Dock or a USB-C-to-HDMI cable, so with the right apps it will match Microsoft’s other Surface Pro devices.The Surface Pro X lasts for about nine hours of work, mainly using Edge with 10 or so tabs, Windows Mail, Evernote, Typora, Nextgen Reader and various different messaging apps. That’s about the same as the Core i5 version of the Surface Pro 6, and therefore slightly disappointing, given ARM processors are meant to be more battery-efficient. But nine hours is good enough to comfortably finish a full work day without reaching for the charger.Thanks to the USB-C ports you have options for charging the tablet. The included 65W Surface Connect charger works great, but a USB-C Power Delivery charger, which is now the common standard for phones, tablets and most laptops, works just fine too.The Surface Pro X has two USB-C ports, plus Microsoft’s Surface Connect for power or connecting to the optional Surface Dock (£189.99).The two USB-C ports are very welcome, but note that they are not Thunderbolt 3. A USB-C dock, Ethernet adapter, HDMI cable, card reader, headphone adapter and various USB-C to USB-A adapters with flash drives all worked as expected.Built-in mobile broadband is transformational for working on the move too, better than using a mobile hotspot, because Windows and you can see when you’re actually in range of good signal.The Surface Pro X follows the lead of Microsoft’s recent Surface Laptop 3 in being more repairable than previous machines. Repair specialists iFixit gave the Surface Pro X a score of six out of 10 thanks to some modular, replaceable elements.Microsoft states that the battery is not user-replaceable, and while the SSD can be replaced by a user it will not be covered by warranty instead both can be repaired or replaced by authorised service providers.Windows 10 Home runs on the Surface Pro X just like any other machine: a stable, well-featured and useful operating system. You likely won’t have an option to run Linux or any other operating system, but then you’re buying a computer from Microsoft, so there are certainly better options for non-Windows users.The Surface Pro X is Microsoft’s gamble on ARM chips as one future of Windows devices, enabling thinner, lighter, longer-lasting and always-connected machines.But it hasn’t paid off just yet. For something promising to be a fully-fledged Windows 10 computer costing upwards of £999, there just isn’t enough ARM-native software available.Attempt to run something that’s not designed for an ARM chip and you either straight-up can’t, if there isn’t a 32-bit version of the app, or Windows is forced to run it in an emulation layer, which is like having the handbrake on – slow and ponderous.The Surface Pro X has a lot of potential. Use an ARM-native app such as Microsoft’s new Edge browser and it absolutely flies. But even things such as Office aren’t ARM.The killer blow for me is a lack of photo-editing apps. Without Photoshop, Affinity Photo or something similarly powerful I simply can’t get my work done. It essentially relegates the Surface Pro X into the Chromebook camp: it’ll do most of the things you need to do most of the time, but can’t be your only computer.The Surface Pro X is a beautiful, premium machine that has totally unrealised potential. If Microsoft can convince developers to jump on the ARM bandwagon it’ll be amazing. Until then, if you want a Microsoft tablet you’re better off with a Surface Pro 6 or 7.Cons: not much ARM-native software, no good photo editors, no SD card reader, no headphone socket, no Thunderbolt 3, keyboard not included This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

What is the best device for all the popular streaming services including the upcoming Disney+? To my knowledge, it is not yet confirmed if it will be available on my Roku-powered Now TV box. AdnanYou may be in luck, because Disney has just signed a deal with Sky. As a result, Disney+ will be available via Sky from its UK launch on 24 March, to be followed by Now TV in the coming months, says Sky. It’s not clear how many months that means. Perhaps Sky does not know. However, I’d assume it means some time this year, not next.Disney+ will be available via web browsers on PCs, on Android and Apple iOS smartphones and tablets, on Amazon Fire TV and Fire tablets, on Roku streamers, on Apple TV, the Sony PlayStation 4 and Microsoft’s Xbox One, and via Google Chromecast.It will also cover almost all the big smart TV platforms: Roku TV, Android TV, LG’s WebOS and Samsung’s Tizen. In the UK, BT and Virgin Media still appear to be missing, but pretty much every Ask Jack reader should be able to get Disney+ on a device they already own.Disney is also pricing the service to attract annual signups, with a pre-launch offer of £49.99 (£10 off) if you subscribe on or before 23 March. This includes HD and 4K videos, for which other services may charge extra. It will also let you download movies to watch later.Disney+ will not initially have the volume of content you can get from Netflix or Amazon Prime. However, Disney’s string of takeovers of Pixar (2006), Marvel (2009), Lucasfilm (2012) and 21st Century Fox (2017) means it makes up in box office appeal what it lacks in depth.It’s got Star Wars plus The Mandalorian, the Toy Story series and the rest of Pixar’s back catalogue, the Marvel movies and Disney’s studio productions, including a vast library covering everything from the original 1928 Steamboat Willie (Mickey Mouse’s first short film) to several versions of Beauty and the Beast. It’s also going to spend something like $1bn a year on new productions.There’s no guarantee that Disney+ will be available on every major platform in every country, so you should check before you subscribe. Nonetheless, I expect it will appeal to families with children of all ages. In the long term, it should give Netflix some real competition.Now TV boxes are based on Roku technology but don’t provide all of Roku’s services. Instead, they are customised for Sky TV viewers, who want to watch Sky Sports, Sky Cinema, and so on. The platform’s attractions are that the boxes are generally quite cheap, and discount coupons let you buy services for a short time rather than paying for annual subscriptions. Sky Sports sells expensive passes that last for a day, a week or a month.If you use Sky’s streaming services, Now TV is a good choice. You can watch BBC iPlayer and other British catch-up services, plus Netflix and other video services, though not Amazon Prime. If you don’t watch Sky, you’d be better off with a Roku streamer or something similar.It really depends on how keen you are to get Disney+, how keen you are to buy a new gadget and which other services you need. For example, someone who mainly watches Amazon Prime may lean towards a Fire TV, while the odd bod who subscribes to Apple TV+ may prefer an Apple TV box.Roku got started when Netflix decided not to make its own streaming device but gave Roku’s founder – Anthony Wood, a former Netflix vice-president – a $6m investment to create one. Since then, Roku has positioned itself as an independent supplier in a somewhat balkanised market.It did deals to provide “channels” (apps) for Amazon videos and, more recently, Apple TV+. It also provides a free software development kit that enables anyone to create a channel in a Visual Basic-style scripting language called BrightScript.In 2014, Roku launched Roku TV, which enabled TV manufacturers to build its system into smart TV sets. These can be updated in much the same way as Roku streaming sticks, and seem to have become popular in the US. Hisense, a Chinese TV manufacturer, launched the first Roku TV in the UK and Europe in November.Roku hardware is usually cheap because the company makes almost two-thirds of its revenues from CTV (connected TV advertising), not sales of devices. It should also get a cut when Roku owners use their device to subscribe to paid-for channels. More users means more money.Some Roku devices had voice search and control, and last year Roku launched a skill for Alexa. (Note: needs Roku OS 8.1 or later.) I have not tried it, but if you own an Amazon Echo, Dot or Show etc, your Roku should work with it. However, given that voice commands don’t seem to work all that well on Amazon’s Fire TV, don’t set your expectations too high.Streaming sticks are tiny computers complete with a processor, memory and an operating system. If you are willing to pay a bit more, you can get one with a faster processor and more memory, which should deliver better performance. Some can also play quite good games. The leading examples include Nvidia’s Shield TV, based on the Android TV platform, and Apple TV.The basic idea of Android TV – successor to the failed Google TV – is to use Android for streaming. It can be supplied in a set-top box or built into a TV set. Of course, Android apps are designed to work with touch on a smartphone, not with a remote control on a big TV screen, so they must be adapted. Check which apps are available in the Google Play Store for Android TV.The saving grace is that all Android TV devices support Google Cast, so you can set up streaming from another device and use your smartphone as the controller. Once installed, streams are downloaded directly, just as with a Roku. They are not sent from the originating smartphone, tablet or PC. Some devices also support Google Assistant, which can be handy.The alternative is to buy cheap streamers for £20-£50 and treat them as disposables. That works for me.Have you got a question?

Snaps of a weekend spent at its newest UK branch, in Birmingham’s Jewellery Quarter, were met with heart-eye emojis and “that hotel looks beautiful!” comments. The fact it’s a hostel – with affordable pet-friendly suite rooms (plus dorms), a yoga studio and a South American-style restaurant due to open in the summer – was something I revelled in sharing.It’s in a former Victorian gold and silverworks factory, with the red-brick exterior still featuring the names of previous business. The maze of corridors (with cubby holes for reading) lead to a range of dorms and private rooms. Dusky pink, eggshell blue and emerald green run throughout, with velvet chairs, bold murals, gold fixtures and large plants. The largest room, The Loft, was a winner for my weekend for 2.5 guests (the half being a small dog). There are high ceilings and large windows, and it has a comfy seating area, desk, small kitchen and bathroom. In the lounge-bar downstairs, there are activities including drink-and-draw sessions with Cass Arts. On upper floors (above bedrooms) is a communal kitchen, living-dining area, cinema room and yoga-and-wellness studio.What about breakfast and dinner?The restaurant is due to open in the summer, serving breakfast followed by an all-day menu. Currently, a simple breakfast is included (toast, cereal, juice and hot drinks). The bar serves cocktails, wine and beer all day. If heading out, there are brunch spots towards the city centre. Medicine Bakery and Gallery (15 minutes’ walk) is close to Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery and does mammoth plates of sourdough and rye, loaded with eggs – from masala-spiced and huevos rancheros, to scrambled with thick-cut smoked salmon and dill creme fraiche.What’s on the doorstep?Among the 500 or so retailers in the surrounding Jewellery Quarter – as well as the listed Victorian buildings and ghost signs – are local foodie favourites including Otto (wood-fired pizza and homemade limoncello) and 1000 Trades, a pub serving local brews with a new foodie pop-up each month.The Digbeth area’s former factories are now home to venues: including arts centres the Custard Factory and Eastside Projects. Digbeth Dining Club has taken over another space under the railway bridge and is hard to beat for fun after dark. It combines a rotating array of street food stalls, and Mama Roux’s live music and performance venue. Just round the corner is Birmingham’s oldest pub, the black-and-white timber Old Crown, which opened in 1368, and now includes a huge beer garden. How much?Dorms from £15, double from £35, loft suite from £60.• selinaAntonia WilsonWhat’s it like?“Down here is the only part of the building left from the 1600s I tend not to come down after dark,” one of the staff at the Court tells me as we head into a space in the basement.Layers of history are kept intact throughout this former courthouse and jail, most of which dates from the 19th century. Excavation has continued on the lower ground floor, uncovering older rooms and a staircase thought to have been used by judges to escape trouble. The basement is already used for beer tastings every evening and there are plans to open a whisky bar.The listed building has had many original features restored. The vast courtroom, housing the largest mixed-gender 24-pod-bed dorm, still has original panelling and a vaulted ceiling. There are 200 Japanese-style curtained pod beds across several dorms and 12 private rooms (some en suite) in the former cells, with bolted doors and tiny barred windows. Decor is plain, without being clinical: white walls, grey tartan details. Keep eyes peeled for the graffiti by former inmates on the walls of what were once holding cells, now knocked through to form the staircase and the refurbished security gates in some corridors. The common room includes pews from the courthouse, with Scots Law pages as wallpaper.What about breakfast and dinner?Breakfast is included, with a buffet of fruit, yogurt, cereals, batter to use in the waffle-maker, along with ingredients for cheese toasties. No other meals are served but the kitchen is open for guests to use any time. Daily beer tastings cost £5 (six brews to try).What’s on the doorstep?It’s in the Old Town, so there’s plenty nearby. For free live music, Stramash, in a converted church, is popular – showcasing local bands, plus hosting cèilidh and other events. I also visited 12th-century St Giles’ Cathedral as part of the Burns \u0026amp Beyond culture trail, an annual event opening up unusual venues for small gigs. The cathedral is open year round.Holyrood Distillery is nearby and is the first single-malt distillery to open in the city for 100 years. It’s been welcoming visitors since July 2019 and offers tours (from £14) with whisky and gin tastings and games in the interactive aroma room. The first official batch of the single malt will be available in 2023. After all that merriment, a hike up Arthur’s Seat will help shake-off hangovers, followed by lunch round the corner at The Outsider, serving soups, salads and nutritious, seasonal food, or at Civerinos for its 20in stone-baked pizzas (slice from £3.95, pie from £19.75). It’s open until midnight at weekends. For culture, lesser-known galleries and museums in the vicinity include Stills for contemporary photography or gruesome anatomy artefacts at the Surgeons’ Hall Museums.How much?Dorm pod beds from £11 B\u0026ampB, private rooms from £40 B\u0026ampB• codehostels• Rail travel from London provided by thetrainlineAWWhat’s it like?Opened in October 2019 – after a refurbishment of a hostel acquired by the YHA – Newcastle Central is part of the hostelling association’s move into city centres. On the site of a prison, the hostel is in part of the city’s former telephone exchange, built in 1932.The ground floor is mostly taken up with a cafe – where I was checked in. My private room was on the snug side and dominated by a huge flatscreen television but was cosily warm – very welcome since it was freezing outside. There was enough space for a double bed (I slept like a log both nights), a small desk and a couple of wireless phone-charging shelves. Clothes storage amounted to hangers on the wall, and one corner of the room had been sacrificed to a prefab en suite.You don’t come to a hostel to spend time in your room, though. I found it a good space to use as a base and for the rate, it’s exceptional value. There are suites, too, if room to spread out is needed, and traditional dorms if feeling sociable.What about breakfast and dinner?Unlike many YHA hostels, there’s no kitchen for guests to cook their own meals. It is possible to bring cooked food in and staff are happy to supply crockery and cutlery. The hostel does, however, run a funky licensed cafe on the premises. At night, this has a bar feel, with its dimmed lights and industrial exposed-brick-and-girder aesthetic. In one corner, a wall is adorned with photos of the prisoner class of 1873, whose stay on this site was less pleasurable than my own.Breakfast is what you might expect in a hostel: a buffet of cereal, yoghurt (dairy and soya), toast, ham and cheese, and hot drinks and juices. The all-day menu features standard dishes, such as stone-baked pizzas, jacket potatoes, and burgers. However, the light bites section is more adventurous: panko squid strips and mock duck pancakes included! I opted for the Mediterranean vegetable and olive salad, a portion of fries and a non-dairy strawberry and yuzu ice-cream – all very palatable, as was the bill: £13. And should you stay the night and have children under 10 with you, they eat for free.What’s on the doorstep?I came by train, so was pleased to find the hostel an uncomplicated 10-minute walk from the city’s mainline station. It’s a stone’s throw from Grainger Town: stuffed with listed buildings and where most of Newcastle’s shopping, eating and drinking gets done. The area is also home to The Stand Comedy Club and the Theatre Royal. I went for an enriching (and free) self-devised art-and-lit walking tour: the traditional Laing Art Gallery, the contemporary Biscuit Factory (the UK’s largest independent art gallery) – both of which have great cafes – and finally, after a stroll along the River Tyne, the Lit and Phil, a gloriously fusty independent library where you can grab a coffee and read surrounded by 200,000 books.What’s it like?The decline of the British pub is well documented but closures have slowed in the last few years, thanks to local campaigns, communities fighting back – and projects such as PubLove helping reinvigorate the scene. Since 2007, the company has been refurbishing pubs around London, modernising while retaining character, and adding hostel rooms to the underused upper floors.A popular spot on a quiet corner near London Bridge, The Rose \u0026amp Crown on Union Street opened in June 2019. It’s a mixture of modern bunk dorms with block colour walls in emerald green and yellow, and shared bathrooms. There’s also a large modern double en suite in the loft, with weathered wood and white brick walls, geometric print carpet and a huge bathroom. The common room is the buzzy pub itself. It had a great atmosphere on a Thursday night, after an evening mooching around nearby Bermondsey. Interiors in the pub mix traditional elements such as wood panelling, green tiling and a horseshoe bar, with modern touches of exposed brickwork, white walls and velvet chairs. What about breakfast and dinner?Brunch is served 9am-6pm – with options from toast with spreads (£2) to full veggie breakfast (£9) and shakshuka (£10). Noon to 10pm, there are also burgers (from £10) – including vegan ones – and loaded fries (from £5.50). The bar is available 247 for guests.What’s on the doorstep?A 10-minute walk east, Bermondsey has the Beer Mile – a stretch of tap rooms and indie bottle shops under old railway arches. It’s actually closer to two miles, and there are 18 stops to choose from over an afternoon, with Maltby Street market a good starting point for food – from cheesy Venezuelan arepa buns to rich Ethiopian lentil wat.Round the corner, Bermondsey Street’s Victorian terraces are now home to independent restaurants, boutique shops, basement bars, plus the Fashion and Textile Museum is here too. If visiting on the last Thursday of the month, the speakeasy-style Izakaya, in the basement of ramen restaurant Hakata, runs masterclass tasting evenings for free. Hosted by a different drinks supplier each time, it also includes nibbles, such as sticky gochugaru ribs and spicy edamame. Just opposite the hostel, Flat Iron Square street food market, is popular year-round with indoor and outdoor areas, open midday to midnight most days, with live music, DJs, sports screenings and other events. The hostel is also well placed for exploring the South Bank, including Tate Modern, Shakespeare’s Globe and the Shard.How much?Dorms from £13, double en suite from £110.• publoveAWWhat’s it like?As I’m checking in, Andy, at reception, is keen on sharing news of what lies ahead for this already-impressive 96-room hostel on Hatton Garden – less than 10 minutes’ walk from Liverpool Lime Street station. His eagerness is borne of potential (25 more beds will be added by June) and adventure, as he and the Sleep Eat Love team are planning a fact-finding tour of Europe and UK hostels. The mission: to improve what Sleep Eat Love offers. For my part, one improvement would be the signposting, as my choice of stairs over lift means a circuitous route around this labyrinth-like former fire station. Still, that allows for fact-finding of my own as I pass hostel staples, such as a laundry room, lounge, games room and kitchen areas.My private en suite double is spacious and wants for nothing, save for a television, though I don’t see that omission as onerous (wifi is free). There are industrial design touches in its lights and fittings, while a flourish-free bed, wardrobe and mirror-frame have a woodchip-effect. It’s all functional and sturdy – with brightness provided by a colourful mural – but lacks an overall aesthetic, which explains the team’s search for ideas. The feel of the hostel (and communal spaces) is friendly and secure, aided by a reception staffed 247.What’s on the doorstep?Liverpool’s compact centre means a short stroll to everything, from shopping at Liverpool One (7 minutes) to the museums, Mersey ferry terminal and waterfront grandeur of Pier Head and The Three Graces (Royal Liver Building, Cunard Building and Port of Liverpool Building 12 minutes). Closer still are the Cavern Club on Mathew Street and the World Museum and Walker Art Gallery, as well as my favourite: Central Library, featuring the Victorian Grade II-listed Picton Reading Room. With Love Thy Neighbour not open for dinner on the Sunday of my stay, I savoured the small dishes and tiffin tins of Mowgli Street Food on Water Street and micro-distillery gins of Liverpool Gin Distillery (tastings and classes available) on Castle Street.How much?Dorm beds from £15, private rooms from £30.• sleepeatlove Robert Hull• Accommodation and meals were provided by Sleep Eat Love and Love Thy NeighbourLooking for a holiday with a difference?

Now, though, they’re feeling increasingly inessentialAmazing Stories is – wait for it – not that amazing. The new Apple TV+ show, released last week, is a revival of a 1980s series that was overseen by Steven Spielberg. The master director is involved with the reboot, too, which arrives back to take its place within one of the big TV trends of the past few years. Amazing Stories is an anthology: a collection of self-contained tales rather than a running series. Such shows can be a haven for experimentation and offbeat excellence and ought to be perfect for our low-attention- age, where new streaming services seem to arrive each week. But, as modern anthologies become more prevalent, so they become a byword for hokey lameness and a lack of quality control.Anthologies in the 21st century are led by Black Mirror, a show concerned with the telling of spooky, tech-related fables. Like its ancient precursor The Twilight Zone, its intriguing set-upsurprising twisthaunting moral format can only be done in an anthology: nobody wants a 13-episode season entirely about a weird app, or a forest that turns out to be made of haunted computers, or whatever.But as the years have gone by, the perfectly turned Black Mirror episode, with a fresh premise and devastating pay-off, has felt more and more elusive. When new episodes drop, it’s wise to wait a few days for critics and people with more time on their hands than you to let you know which is the single instalment you need to catch. The duds, the ones that aren’t San Junipero or Nosee, recede from view, doomed to appear near the bottom of a hundred “every episode … ranked!” articles.That is the problem with anthologies: yes, it can be good not to have to commit to yet another box set, but the flipside is that collections of self-contained narratives feel innately inessential. When shows employ different writers and directors with wildly differing styles, there is nothing to lock you in and make the next episode a must-see. Unless you are watching something like the Apple TV+ series Little America, which is about the immigrant experience and thus thrives on a ersity of stories, the lack of a coherent, singular voice merely guarantees inconsistency.Take the 2019 reboot of The Twilight Zone itself, exec-produced by Get Out director Jordan Peele. It’s … OK. Hit and miss. Not bad. There’s one called Replay about a weird camcorder that is pretty neat. Really, though, it is devoid of the era-skewering boldness of the original 1950s60s show, or even a focused new vision of its own.Anthologies are better when they are the vision of one creator or team. The trouble is, coming up with a glut of good, inidual scripts is beyond almost everyone. Last year’s Amazon romcom series Modern Love was a decent halfway house, with roughly half of it helmed by OnceSing Street director John Carney, and the whole enterprise anchored by being based on an existing New York Times column that could be filleted for its best tales, even if many of them had a charm that was a bit too flighty and diaphanous for TV. Besides, the series also relied on another trope of anthologies to bring in viewers: guest star roles. Roping in the likes of Anne Hathaway, Tina Fey and Ed Sheeran meant producers could bank on audiences tuning in despite shaky scripts. That is not to say that the unicorn of the unmissable anthology can’t ever exist. Ryan Murphy has done some of his best work on American Horror Story and American Crime Story (the latter being the umbrella under which The People V OJ Simpson and The Assassination of Gianni Versace sheltered), although that is an anthology in the sense of each season, not each episode, being self-contained, and, in the case of Horror Story, even that is not always true.Elsewhere, we are just coming to the end of series five of Inside No 9, the persistent high quality and variety of which has put its writersstars Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton among the all-time TV greats. Mind you, even there, the more experimental new run faintly suggests that Shearsmith and Pemberton might be tiring under the burden of constantly turning out gems – and they still have another two series to write.Other successful anthologies embrace their throwaway nature: take Moving On, the recently returned BBC1 daytime series that is designed to be enjoyed with a rich tea finger and a mug of Mellow Birds.Which brings us back to Amazing Stories, whose first episode, The Cellar – a time-travel tale not unlike the Nicholas Lyndhurst sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart – suggests a pleasant but dated series is on the way, for you to take or leave. Despite a big-budget revival, it’s clear that this, and many other anthologies, should’ve been left firmly in the past."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73eec67ea31ccc3745a923c78037bf1770d3eb57/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa77f37cc76818d2c62ef549d63c7207","title":"black republicans african american voters","story":"African American politicians and activists on the right say they’ve found support in the black community through dialogueFor Brad Mole, venturing into Republican politics didn’t start with a sudden awakening to conservatism. It was his religious upbringing and way of life that brought him to the Republican party.“My faith pushed me more toward policies that better reflected my upbringing,” he said. “I began understanding that the teachings I was raised with were more reflected in a party that not many around me identified with.”The son of a preacher in the Lowcountry region of South Carolina, Mole is now taking his politics a giant leap forward, challenging the Democrat Joe Cunningham for his US congressional seat.As analysts debunk the myth of the black voter monolith, some black Republicans are stepping forward to counter stereotypes and assert a political identity very different from the usual assumption that all black Americans are Democrats, especially in the era of Donald Trump.As one of seven Republicans running for the seat, Mole credits his religious background for his motivations to join the crowded race. Those same traditions are often associated with centrist African American political leanings. But for black Americans like Mole, their conservatism leads some to question whether their political party and preferences actually match their worldview.“I am the typical black person who voted for Barack Obama, but I then voted for Trump,” he said. “At some point you think for yourself and say: ‘You know what? I’m not voting this person or this ticket just because my grandma or parents did.’”Ahead of a June Republican primary and the 2020 presidential election, Mole says he is connecting with fellow voters in ways he said speak more to the nuance of conservative cultural traditions.He is not alone. Kaaryn Walker, president of Black Conservatives for Truth, founded the advocacy group as an outlet for black Americans to connect with one another and draw attention to conservative policy initiatives.“Sometimes you find that people share the same politics you do, but because of fear or backlash, black people don’t talk about it,” said Walker.“If you want to see the Republican party be more erse, you have to see us being active in the party,” she said.Walker has identified as a conservative for more than 25 years, pointing to her pro-life leanings and support for free market economics. Like Mole, an upbringing steeped in tradition led her to a closer affiliation with Republicans than the Democratic party her family typically supported.In her outreach, she often challenges others to rethink how Democratic platforms represent black values.“We engage on policy and that’s when people start seeing distinctions,” she said. “People start seeing other like-minded conservatives and say: ‘My policy and mindset doesn’t fit the Democratic party and that’s OK.’”In the decades since the notorious Southern Strategy saw white southerners flock to the Republican party in the wake of the successes of the civil rights movement, black voters have maintained close ties with Democrats that has remained steady throughout much of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.Modern black Republicans aren’t a particularly new phenomenon, though. Several conservatives, including the former Republican party chair Michael Steele and former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, have led prominent Republican initiatives that, in the past, sparked speculation of potential presidential runs.The South Carolina senator Tim Scott has more recently stepped forward as one of the president’s most loyal supporters and has been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s efforts to appeal to black voters.“Narrowing the wage gap, the First Step Act for prison reform, investing in black colleges,” she said. “Those of us proud of that progress are doing the work of educating the people who are ignorant to it.”Pew data collected in 2017 found that although “African American voters remain overwhelmingly Democratic”, that identification “has declined modestly in recent years”.As Democratic campaigns face increasing demand to center black voter ersity, the Trump administration took notice, investing additional campaign dollars on aggressive outreach to African American communities.Those initiatives include campaign ads in traditional black media outlets and a slew of “Black Voices for Trump” rallies at makeshift community storefronts in key battleground states.In a press release announcing the initiative, the Trump campaign pinpointed “record-low minority unemployment rates” and investments in historically black colleges and universities, as evidence of the president’s continued commitment to black communities.“President Trump has a real record of results for black Americans, and our party is committed to sharing that winning message far and wide,” the Republican national committee chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, said.Opponents of Trump point to his controversial past with race, including a history of housing discrimination lawsuits. Although one in six black Americans are the children of immigrants, Trump has called Caribbean and African nations “shithole countries”, recently banning migrants from several African nations.Most notable are a series of print ads in 1989 calling for the death penalty for the now-exonerated Central Park Five. Authorities involved in the case later said the ads contributed to the black and Latino men’s wrongful convictions.Walker admits an uphill battle in wooing fellow African Americans who take issue with the president’s record. She counters criticisms of being a “traitor to her race” by contending no one person is representative of the party values.“If the only reason that you’re a Democrat is because you think the Republicans are racist then you need to go back and figure out why you’re really a Democrat,” she said.“Racism does not discriminate by party, and you see that playing out right now in the Democratic primaries with misstep after misstep.”But the vitriol has gotten intense. Walker recalled being unfriended, blocked or disinvited from events many times in recent years.The rise of prominent black Republican figures whose platforms stoke controversy can also make her a target.“Sometimes I’ll get a call to my phone or social media and a phantom voice is yelling, screaming and cursing at me,” she said. “But then they’re surprised when I respond with ‘Are you done? Now let’s try that again and actually have a dialogue because that’s what politics are about.’”To Mole, pushback is an opportunity to engage. He noted peer support for his platform seldom wanes even after he mentions his name will appear on the ballot with an “R”.“Sometimes you get a look, or an ‘I don’t know about that’ but, most times, from just talking, folks open up and realize for themselves just how conservative their values are.”But he’s not out to change minds he wants rebuild a sense of community.Pointing to recent White House forums tackling black issues alongside Senator Scott, Mole said there was a momentum building most would overlook – one that motivates him as he canvasses the state.“People out there are looking for someone that’s going to listen to them and one of the first things my party can do is just come to the table,” he said. “I’m willing to have those conversations where people of either party don’t go, to speak to the issues.”Although he is a heavy underdog, it’s those kitchen-table discussions on shared traditional values Mole hopes will draw voters out in June, and again in November, regardless of his placing in the state primary.Walker insisted what’s at stake is bigger than any one election or polarizing president.“We’re a community whose principles and convictions are silenced in the broader narrative of black voters,” she said. “But we’re here fighting to preserve our conservative culture as we vote Republican across the country.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d58af01543223bd840e09cf969ee08b0a380d57/0_15_1500_900/master/1500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=75026e1d4279f78531785f84455d0064","title":"sarah palin rap tv masked singer baby got back","story":"Sarah Palin, a former Republican governor and running mate of 2008 presidential candidate John McCain, stunned Americans with an appearance on TV show The Masked Singer in which she rapped Baby Got Back while dressed as a furry bear.The popular show involves mystery guests in elaborate costumes singing songs. Their identities are then revealed. Dressed as a bear, Palin had sung the hit song by Sir Mix-a-Lot, dancing around the stage and belting out the lyrics with gusto to a cheering crowd.The revelation of the one-time conservative powerhouse as being the singer inside the purple and pink bear costume appeared to stun host Nick Cannon. “This might be the most shocked I’ve ever been on this show,” he said.Palin explained her reasons for choosing the bear costume as being rooted in her image as a lover of the outdoors in her native Alaska.“The bear is part of my nickname growing up and the whole ‘Mama Bear’ thing, and they’re in Alaska,” she said. “Bear was easy.”Palin has been a controversial figure in American politics ever since she was tapped by McCain to be the person one heartbeat away from the presidency had he won the 2008 election.Though McCain lost that contest to Barack Obama, it launched Palin’s career as a powerful figure on the American right whose populist style, mega-watt fame and blend of conservatism and reality show appearances have often been seen as foreshadowing the rise of Donald Trump.The reaction of people on Twitter was generally one of amazement, especially in the middle of a news cycle devoted to the ongoing coronavirus crisis.“Sarah Palin rapping ‘Baby Got Back’ on The Masked Singer with a fade into a Trump coronavirus update is the psychedelic dystopia we’re living in now,” tweeted writer and journalist Ashley Spencer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baa8080fa691dd84b83fa3d5802ec79a08ff3af1/0_107_4668_2800/master/4668.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43c065c9902738b3a5603ffb7070f1b5","title":"donald tump coronavirus travel ban joe biden bernie sanders stock markets live updates","story":"Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden is speaking now, follow live at the top of our blog.

Others described the meeting as heated, testy with many lawmakers leaving flooded with graver concerns about the administration’s response.“We should be exuding confidence nationally, said Representative Anna Eshoo, Democrat of California. “The confusion is damaging.”Washington DC, is straining for an ample response to the coronavirus outbreak that is testing the nation’s political and health care systems, the Associated Press writes.Donald Trump restricted air travel from Europe, Congress ran into trouble approving an aid package and the centers of power the domed Capitol and stately White House are being shuttered to visitors.Trump, in an Oval Office address to the nation Wednesday night, said the monthlong restriction on travel would begin late Friday at midnight. After days of playing down the threat, he blamed Europe for not acting quickly enough to address the “foreign virus” and claimed that U.S. clusters were “seeded” by European travelers.But he said Thursday that he is also considering restricting travel to domestic hot spots such as California and Washington state. “Is it a possibility? Yes,” he said.The president was talking in the White House moments ago.The president invited press questions while hosting Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar in the Oval Office.The Brazilian government has confirmed that President Jair Bolsonaro’s communications secretary, Fabio Wajngarten, has coronavirus just days after meeting Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago, the ’s Dom Phillips, in Rio de Janeiro, reports.Confirming a newspaper report, it said:The medical service of the presidency of the Republic adopted and is adopting all the necessary preventive measures to preserve the health of the president of the Republic and the entire presidential committee which accompanied him on the recent trip to the United States, as well as presidential palace staff.This is because one of the members of the group, Fabio Wajngarten, secretary of communication of the presidency of the Republic, is carrying the new coronavirus Covid-19, confirmed in a control test.Wajngarten shared photos of himself with Trump and Mike Pence during the trip, as well as Bolsonaro.

The recent cancellations by Trump and his Democratic opponents Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders have already upended the election campaign this month.Trump mentions that rallies he’s planned to hold in Nevada as part of his election campaign have been canceled and looks like an upcoming one in Florida is off now, too.“We canceled one in Las Vegas, and Reno, we had about three of them in Nevada, and four or five of them that we’re thinking about,” he said.He said there is a rally planned in Tampa, Florida, (March 25) for which tickets have been selling well.“But I think we will probably not do it,” he said.And putting it all in context, the president added:“Two months,” he said, without elaborating, but in the context of expecting the virus will peter out in the US in that time frame.“In the meantime we want to lose as few people as possible. This morning, is it 32?” As of this morning the death toll from the virus in the US was 38, but the number of deaths and cases changes sometimes by the hour.Trump points out the death toll in the US is much lower than most other countries so far.

The two leaders dined together at Mar-a-Lago in Florida last Saturday night and Bolsonaro and ministers who were on the trip are reportedly under observation.The news was revealed by Fabio Wajngarten’s wife Sophie on a WhatsApp group of parents at the school their children attend, the Folha de S.Paulo newspaper reported on Thursday.“My husband returned from the trip to Miami yesterday and did the Covid exam which was positive,” she wrote, referring to the novel strain of coronavirus involved in the current outbreak, Covid-19. She added that he is “taking all care at home and since his return he has been isolated in a room, following all the quarantine protocol.”Wajngarten had attacked Brazilian media yesterday after reports he had been tested for the virus. “I’m well,” he tweeted.

Redfield responds in the affirmative: “Some cases have been actually diagnosed that way in the United States today.”Redfield’s vague answer was enough to add fuel to a conspiracy theory that has been gaining traction over the past two weeks in China – that the coronavirus did not originate in China but may have come from the US instead.“The US has finally acknowledged that among those who had died of the influenza previously were cases of the coronavirus. The true source of the virus was the US!” one commentator said. “The US owes the world, especially China, an apology,” another said. “American coronavirus,” one wrote.The theory has gained traction over the past few weeks, after a respected epidemiologist Zhong Nanshan, said in a passing remark at a press conference on 27 February that although the virus first appeared in China “it may not have originated in China”.Zhong later clarified his statement, saying that the first place where a disease is discovered does not “equate to it being the source”. He told reporters: “But neither can we conclude that the virus came from abroad. Only through investigation and tracing can we answer that question.”Yet only Zhong’s first comment has stuck, repeated by Chinese diplomats, state media and officials who have subtly encouraged the idea. China’s ambassador to South Africa said last week on Twitter that the virus was not necessarily “made in China”.An editorial in Xinhua last week also echoed Zhong: “The epidemic was first reported in China but that does not mean it necessarily originated in China … The WHO has said many times that Covid-19 is a global phenomenon with its source still undetermined.”Officials have framed the campaign as a protest against the “politicisation” of the outbreak by countries such as the US, where some officials have continued to use the terms “Chinese coronavirus” or “Wuhan virus,” despite the World Health Organization’s discouragement. But analysts say China may be looking to deflect blame as the coronavirus spreads around the world.“We might be heading into first global recession caused by Chinese Communist party mismanagement,” wrote Bill Bishop, author of the China newsletter Sinocism. “Previous manmade disasters in China since 1949 never really spread outside the People’s Republic of China’s borders in meaningful ways.”“This time looks to be different … And that is likely one of the reasons the propaganda apparatus and PRC officials are pushing so hard the idea that virus may not have originated in China,” he wrote.For weeks, Chinese state media pointed to a seafood market in Wuhan as the likely origin for the virus while researchers said the source had not yet been determined, but few have floated the idea that it came from outside of China. Another respected Chinese researcher, Zhang Wenhong, said in an interview with the China Daily that he did not believe the virus had been imported into China.“If that was the case, we should have seen patients emerging from different regions in the country around the same time rather than their concentration in Wuhan,” he said, in comments that later appeared to have been removed from the interview.“I think the consensus is still clearly that the virus did originate in China,” said Jane Duckett, professor at the Scottish Centre for China Research, University of Glasgow, focusing on Chinese policy and health.“This would appear to be a nationalist narrative aimed at countering criticism of the Chinese government for not better managing the outbreak in its early stages,” she said.Shifting the narrative may also be important as China tries to move forward, now that new infections appear to have levelled off. This week, the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, visited Wuhan for the first time since the outbreak began as state media pronounced “victory is near”. State media showed elaborate celebrations marking the closure of the last of the temporary hospitals in Wuhan.“This is a propaganda effort aimed at the domestic audience. Among the Chinese public, there is a general awareness that delays in notifying the public led to many more infections in Wuhan,” said Victor Shih, a politics professor at the University of California, San Diego.He said: “This campaign is aimed at distracting the public from the party’s delayed response.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad5695715e38c31d641f57a279d36537b99be929/0_336_4011_2406/master/4011.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc180dc8adc3085bfe38d9bc85f35e3c","title":"coronavirus symptoms what are they and should i see a doctor","story":" What is Covid-19, how does it spread, what are the symptoms, and at what point should you call a doctor? It is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals.The virus can cause pneumonia. Those who have fallen ill are reported to suffer coughs, fever and breathing difficulties. In severe cases there can be organ failure. As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system. Many of those who have died were already in poor health.In the UK, the medical advice is that if you have recently travelled from areas affected by coronavirus, you should:More NHS advice on what to do if you think you have been exposed to the virus can be found here, and the full travel advice to UK nationals is available here.China’s national health commission confirmed human-to-human transmission in January, and there have been such transmissions elsewhere.As of 12 March, more than 125,000 people have been infected in more than 80 countries, according to the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering.There have over 4,600 deaths globally. Just over 3,000 of those deaths have occurred in mainland China. 68,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus.Another key unknown is how contagious the coronavirus is. A crucial difference is that unlike flu, there is no vaccine for the new coronavirus, which means it is more difficult for vulnerable members of the population – elderly people or those with existing respiratory or immune problems – to protect themselves. Hand-washing and avoiding other people if you feel unwell are important. One sensible step is to get the flu vaccine, which will reduce the burden on health services if the outbreak turns into a wider epidemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b83ed78cb82b690215d066901e8d68d80121764b/0_436_6534_3920/master/6534.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c0e47af45a0a19ebf5663559855075a","title":"ecbs plan to support eurozone banks is underwhelming","story":"Christine Lagarde delivered a disappointing set of measures to mitigate against the impact of coronavirusFor Christine Lagarde, it was the moment to stamp her authority on the European Central Bank – and she blew it. Back in 2012, Mario Draghi announced his arrival at the ECB with his now famous “whatever it takes speech”: a commitment to use all the weapons at the bank’s disposal to halt a run on Italian and Spanish bonds that was threatening the existence of the eurozone.The serious economic repercussions from Covid-19 provided Lagarde, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, with the opportunity to do the same. Two other leading central banks, the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, had already responded aggressively to crashing share prices and the intensifying risk of recession. Now, the markets assumed, was the time for the ECB to do the same.Lagarde disappointed on two counts. Firstly, she committed a cardinal sin of central banking: failing to deliver as much as the markets had been expecting. The ECB package of support for businesses, banks and households was clever and technical but ultimately underwhelming. It lacked any sense of shock and awe.To make matters worse, Lagarde then committed a gaffe at a later press conference, where she said it was not the job of the ECB to close bond spreads. The bond spread is a gauge of the market perception of how sound government finances are across the eurozone. After Draghi’s “whatever it takes speech, the bond spread between German and Italian bonds narrowed markedly. Within minutes of Lagarde’s ill-judged remark, it widened as Italian bond yields shot up.To be fair to Lagarde, she was trying to make the point that there were limits to how much the ECB could do in response to Covid-19, and it was now up to national governments and the European Commission to stimulate activity through tax cuts and spending increases.It is a profound structural weakness of the eurozone that it lacks the institutions that would allow the sort of coordinated monetary and fiscal response that the Bank of England and the Treasury delivered for the UK this week.But Lagarde has made a bad situation even worse."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/40af7992bb6f81a785aadd50e38f6637186ae162/517_551_5450_3270/master/5450.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a66d1eb7f1cddb222cc86adcdf13dce7","title":"health expert brands uks coronavirus response pathetic","story":"Ministers ‘behaving like 19th-century colonialists playing a five-day game of cricket’, says Prof John AshtonA leading public health expert has launched a devastating critique of the government’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak in the UK, saying it is too little too late, lacks transparency and fails to mobilise the public.Prof John Ashton, a former regional director of public health for north-west England, lambasted a lack of preparation and openness from the government and contrasted Britain’s response to that of Hong Kong.“Our lot haven’t been working openly and transparently. They’ve been doing it in a (non) smoke-filled room and just dribbling out stuff. The chief medical officer only appeared in public after about two weeks. Then they have had a succession of people bobbing up and disappearing. Public Health England’s been almost invisible.“Boris Johnson should have convened Cobra himself over a month ago and had regular meetings with the chief medical officer with the evidence. The thing should have been fronted up nationally by one person who could be regarded as the trusted voice and who could have been interrogated regularly. That’s not happened.”The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection. There is some evidence to suggest that masks can help prevent hand-to-mouth transmissions, given the large number of times people touch their faces. The consensus appears to be that wearing a mask can limit – but not eliminate – the risks, provided it is used correctly.Ashton was speaking before a Cobra meeting on Thursday afternoon, which was expected to pave the way for new social distancing measures. An increasing number of European countries, including Ireland, have taken steps to close schools, limit gatherings and place restrictions on transportation.There were no strategies for protecting the vulnerable and there had been a failure to engage the public. “We have a superficial prime minister who has got no grasp of public health,” Ashton said. “Our lot are behaving like 19th-century colonialists playing a five-day game of cricket.“This virus will find the weak points. You can’t just plan this from an office in Whitehall. It’s pathetic. The government doesn’t seem to understand classic public health. You need to be out and about. You need to get your hands dirty – though preferably gloved and using frequent gel,” he said.He warned that the NHS was not in a position to cope with the large numbers of people who could become seriously ill. “It’s a joke when they put up people to say they are really on top of it and if it spreads at a community level the NHS will cope, it’s always coped. The hospitals are full at the moment, A\u0026ampEs are full, beds are full, intensive care is full.”“What the government should have been doing over these last weeks, which they’ve thrown away, is to encourage neighbourhoods, communities, supported by the local public health directors and a joined-up NHS.“They should have been encouraging people to have their own family plans about how they will maintain the family show on the road, who will be taking the kids to school, how do you entertain them in the Easter holidays? They should have been much clearer, sooner, about making it clear that people shouldn’t be travelling so they could cancel their holidays and get their money back on the insurance.“They haven’t done any of that. Who’s going to look after elderly people – stop them having to go out, do their shopping for them? People should have been doing that planning – they should have been pointed in that direction by the government. There’s been no discussion about that at all.”Ashton, a Liverpool fan, said if football matches were held in empty stadiums, there was a risk that fans would congregate in pubs instead. “Clubs that have their own TV channels need to make viewing of the games free to everybody, so people can watch them at home,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eaed675d294e78af45645b6e48d4a21cd57384a0/0_306_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aabf719eb28fa90f722b242e3a265970","title":"how do coronavirus containment measures vary across europe","story":"Countries have announced a range of restrictions from public gatherings to flight bans to school closures.

The British prime minister was due to give a press conference later on Thursday after a meeting of Cobra, the government’s emergency committee.Asked earlier about Dublin’s announcement, the prime minister’s official spokesman said: “We follow our own advice, they will do the same.”The prospect of erging responses caused consternation on both sides of the Irish border and prompted calls for a joint strategy on the island of Ireland. Daniel Baker, the lord mayor of Belfast city council, said it would seek guidance from the Northern Ireland Executive and Public Health Agency.Unionists, who usually prefer to follow London than Dublin, disagreed over whether the threat of coronavirus justified an all-Ireland approach.The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, announced the partial lockdown at a hastily arranged press conference in Washington DC before meeting Donald Trump for a traditional meeting ahead of St Patrick’s Day.“I know that some of this is coming as a real shock,” he said. “And it’s going to involve big changes in the way we live our lives. And I know that I’m asking people to make enormous sacrifices. But we’re doing it for each other.”All indoor gatherings of 100 people or more and outdoor gatherings of 500 or more should be cancelled, Varadkar said. State-run cultural institutions will close but public transport will still run.The lockdown is not as drastic as Italy’s. Shops, cafes and restaurants will remain open, as will airports and ports. Travellers with Covid-19 symptoms are being asked to self-isolate.The taoiseach said he was acting on the latest medical advice. “The virus is all over the world, it will continue to spread but it can be slowed. Acting together as one nation we can save many lives. Our economy will suffer but in time it will bounce back.”Ireland recorded nine new infections on Wednesday, raising its number of cases to 43. It also reported the first death, of an elderly woman with an underlying medical condition. Northern Ireland on Thursday recorded two new cases, bringing its total to 20.The prospect of erging strategies on school closures prompted criticism that authorities were acting as if coronavirus would respect the 310-mile border between the north and south of Ireland.Northern Ireland’s health minister, Robin Swann, told Stormont’s health committee that deaths should also be expected in Northern Ireland but that so far it was not “in the same place” as the Republic. “Our approach is different as there are no signs of community transfer.”Other unionists disagreed. “Since coronavirus doesn’t give a damn about borders or identities it makes sense for NI to follow immediately,” tweeted Alex Kane, a unionist commentator.Jamie Bryson, a loyalist blogger, said Northern Ireland had to recognise it shared an open land border with Ireland. “Regardless of the rights or wrongs of that open border, it is a reality. We face a health crisis that could result in deaths of many people. It is sensible to coordinate the approach between both jurisdictions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/706cbff66ce4fba7a2e846f2dbd97b875c226dfd/512_28_2988_1793/master/2988.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb60738b07447c7e7582a76f129b78cb","title":"self isolating tory mp criticises parliament response to covid 19 coronavirus","story":"Andrew Bridgen, who is to be tested for coronavirus, says parliament should have been closed to visitorsMP Andrew Bridgen has criticised parliament’s response to Covid-19 after developing a cough and becoming the latest politician to self-isolate.The MP for North West Leicestershire said he and his family, including his 18-month-old baby, are due to be tested in the next 48 hours. He is self-isolating from constituents, carrying out work over the phone and Skype.The Tory backbencher said he sat next to health minister Nadine Dorries, who tested positive for the virus, last Thursday at a lunch in one of parliament’s tearooms.“Nadine emailed me and I’ve called 111 and a doctor is going to come out and test us. He’ll test me, my mother-in-law, who is 76, and my son Blake who is 18 months.“I’ve moved my son Blake’s cot out of my room to my mother-in-law’s while I’m coughing.”His wife, Nevena, who is an opera singer, is due to fly back into the UK tomorrow after travelling to Belgrade in Serbia for a performance. He said he will have to arrange for someone else to collect her from the airport as he does not want to risk passing on his illness.The MP said he had concerns that parliament would be somewhere the illness could easily spread due to the number of visitors coming in and out every day and it should have been closed to visitors some time ago.“I said two weeks ago we should have closed parliament to visitors,” he said. “Parliament is like an airport – we have got people coming in from all over the world.“Security have said to me that they have to pat people down from all around the world. We should have stopped visitors coming here two weeks ago. It would only need to be temporary.“I said to the whips office: ‘We are going to get it ever so quickly.’ It’s one of those buildings where we go out to every single part of the country too.”Bridgen argued that all MPs should have been tested at the start of each working week to try to avoid mass contact between iniduals who might have caught the virus.Dorries has self-isolated at home and is now recovering from the coronavirus after falling ill last week. On the Wednesday before her symptoms began she had been at a reception to support International Women’s Day at Downing Street, which was also attended by the prime minister.Johnson is not showing any signs of symptoms.Last night it emerged a cabinet minister has chosen to self-isolate and is awaiting results back from a coronavirus test. The minister attended a Cobra with Johnson earlier in the week.A second health minister, Edward Argar, has also self-isolated after dining with Dorries last Thursday. Senior Conservative Sir Charles Walker has been tested and is awaiting results.Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who had a meeting with Dorries at her office, is also self-isolating and has shown no signs of symptoms.She tweeted: “Public Health England confirmed last night that I am to self-isolate until 19 March providing I remain asymptomatic. I have a stack of work to be getting on with and have moved my meetings to Skype and the phone. Lots to be getting on with.”There are currently no plans to close parliament, which is visited by school groups, tourists and people attending events and receptions.Authorities have met regularly to decide how to deal with the spread of the illness and are said to be basing decisions on the guidance coming from the government’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, with whom the Commons Speaker, Lindsay Hoyle, is in regular contact.There are up to 3,000 members of permanent staff. A parliament spokesperson, said: “We are aware of the importance of parliament and the need to keep it functioning as usual.“There are no plans to suspend parliament changes to the way parliament functions would be a matter for consultation between the Speakers, the government and the parliamentary authorities.“The Speakers and political leadership of both houses are keeping the situation under constant review.

The Foreign Office, however, would be issuing travel advice against taking any school trips abroad, Sturgeon added.The decision relating to mass gatherings was not based on scientific evidence, she said, which suggests it will not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus, but will help for consistency of messaging and to alleviate pressure on the emergency services being stretched by the pandemic.Sturgeon said that, from Friday, people with symptoms indicative of coronavirus should stay at home and self-isolate for seven days.“The decision has been taken that we have now moved from acontain phase into the delay phase, where the objective is to seek to slow downthe spread of the virus, to reduce the numbers who will be infected at the peak,the number infected at any one time,” she said.The government’s plan for tackling the virus, published earlier this month, said that once the second phase of delay had been reached, “action that would be considered could include population distancing strategies (such as school closures, encouraging greater home working, reducing the number of large-scale gatherings) to slow the spread of the disease throughout the population, while ensuring the country’s ability to continue to run as normally as possible.”It is unclear how many of these measures the government will enact in time.Ireland moved to close schools and colleges on Thursday morning to try to halt the spread of the virus.When asked about concerns that other countries were taking a different approach to public health, Johnson’s spokesman said: “We believe that we are taking our decisions based on the best scientific and medical advice that is available.On Wednesday, Donald Trump decided to ban citizens from 26 European countries from entering the US for the next 30 days. Britain and Ireland are exempt from the ruling because they are not in the Schengen border-free travel agreement.No 10 said on Thursday the government had no plans for the UK to follow the US. “It’s not the current position of the UK, based on medical and scientific advice, that we should halt flights,” the spokesman said.Downing Street has so far judged that the disruption that would be caused by blanket school shutdowns, for example, would outweigh the benefits in terms of slowing the spread of the disease.The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.Despite a surge in sales of face masks in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, experts are ided over whether they can prevent transmission and infection.

Richard Horton, the editor of the Lancet, has argued that social distancing measures should have been taken earlier, claiming the government was “playing roulette with the public”.The rationale for social distancing measures is to try to push the worst part of the outbreak into the summer.The government’s action plan said: “The benefits of doing so are that if the peak of the outbreak can be delayed until the warmer months, we can reduce significantly the risk of overlapping with seasonal flu and other challenges (societal or medical) that the colder months bring.“The delay phase also buys time for the testing of drugs and initial development of vaccines andor improved therapies or tests to help reduce the impact of the disease.”Contingency planning is under way to enable Brexit talks with the EU to continue next week. This could involve phone or video calls.The prime minister’s spokesman said there was no change to the timetable and June was still the point at which the UK government would walk away from negotiations if it could not secure a Canada-style trade deal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c378a0f129363ffb36f8b9f719141ce6da4f3382/0_200_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fdf7b8a2d8227bf60a90a5836531b8ee","title":"what is a pandemic coronavirus covid 19","story":"The WHO has declared the Covid-19 outbreak to be a pandemic. But what does that mean?Declaring a pandemic has nothing to do with changes to the characteristics of a disease, but is instead associated with concerns over its geographic spread. According to the World Health Organization, a pandemic is declared when a new disease for which people do not have immunity spreads around the world beyond expectations.Cases that involve travellers who have been infected in a foreign country and have then returned to their home country, or who have been infected by that traveller, known as the “index case”, do not count towards declaring a pandemic. There needs to be a second wave of infection from person to person throughout the community.Once a pandemic is declared, it becomes more likely that community spread will eventually happen, and governments and health systems need to ensure they are prepared for that.An epidemic, on the other hand, is a sudden increase in cases of an illness or disease that can be unique to one country or community.Ultimately, the WHO gets the final say. There is no threshold, such as a certain number of deaths or infections, or number of countries affected, that needs to be met. For example, the Sars coronavirus, identified in 2003, was not declared a pandemic by the WHO despite affecting 26 countries. However, its spread was contained quickly, and only a handful of nations were significantly affected, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Canada.If declaring a pandemic triggers global panic, this can defeat the purpose of trying to raise awareness. Much has been written about whether the declaration of H1N1, colloquially known as “swine flu”, as a pandemic in 2009, caused unnecessary panic, overwhelming emergency departments and causing governments to overspend on antiviral medications. Coronavirus symptoms are generally mild and most people recover within six days.The WHO has stressed that using the word “pandemic” does not signal a change in its advice. It is still urging countries to “detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilise their people”.Dr Nathalie MacDermott, National Institute for Health Research academic clinical lecturer King’s College London, says: “The change of term does not alter anything practically as the world has been advised for the last few weeks to prepare for a potential pandemic, which has hopefully been taken seriously by all countries.“The use of this term however highlights the importance of countries throughout the world working cooperatively and openly with one another and coming together as a united front in our efforts to bring this situation under control.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fed07d6d76070c8f169c09ba98962b4e1337087a/0_77_5315_3190/master/5315.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45db20baef75b7ee860dd22e7daba2de","title":"coronavirus what happens to peoples lungs when they get covid 19","story":"Respiratory physician John Wilson explains the range of Covid-19 impacts, from no symptoms to severe illness featuring pneumoniaWhat became known as Covid-19, or the coronavirus, started in late 2019 and early 2020 in the Chinese city of Wuhan as a cluster of pneumonia cases with an unknown cause.The cause of the pneumonia was found to be a new virus – severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or Sars-CoV-2. The illness caused by the virus is Covid-19.Now declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the majority of people who contract Covid-19 suffer only mild, cold-like symptoms.So how can Covid-19 develop into a more serious illness featuring pneumonia, and what does that do to our lungs and the rest of our body? Australia spoke with Prof John Wilson, president-elect of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and a respiratory physician.He says almost all serious consequences of Covid-19 feature pneumonia.Wilson says people who catch Covid-19 can be placed into four broad categories.The least serious are those people who are “sub-clinical” and who have the virus but have no symptoms.Next are those who get an infection in the upper respiratory tract, which, Wilson says, “means a person has a fever and a cough and maybe milder symptoms like headache or conjunctivitis”.He says: “Those people with minor symptoms are still able to transmit the virus but may not be aware of it.”The largest group of those who would be positive for Covid-19, and the people most likely to present to hospitals and surgeries, are those who develop the same flu-like symptoms that would usually keep them off work.A fourth group, Wilson says, will develop severe illness that features pneumonia.The WHO says the elderly and people with underlying problems like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.When people with Covid-19 develop a cough and fever, Wilson says this is a result of the infection reaching the respiratory tree – the air passages that conduct air between the lungs and the outside.He says: “The lining of the respiratory tree becomes injured, causing inflammation. This in turn irritates the nerves in the lining of the airway. Just a speck of dust can stimulate a cough.“But if this gets worse, it goes past just the lining of the airway and goes to the gas exchange units, which are at the end of the air passages.“If they become infected they respond by pouring out inflammatory material into the air sacks that are at the bottom of our lungs.”He says lungs that become filled with inflammatory material are unable to get enough oxygen to the bloodstream, reducing the body’s ability to take on oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.“That’s the usual cause of death with severe pneumonia,” he says.Prof Christine Jenkins, chair of Lung Foundation Australia and a leading respiratory physician, told  Australia: “Unfortunately, so far we don’t have anything that can stop people getting Covid-19 pneumonia.“People are already trialling all sorts of medications and we’re hopeful that we might discover that there are various combinations of viral and anti-viral medications that could be effective. At the moment there isn’t any established treatment apart from supportive treatment, which is what we give people in intensive care.“We ventilate them and maintain high oxygen levels until their lungs are able to function in a normal way again as they recover.”Wilson says patients with viral pneumonia are also at risk of developing secondary infections, so they would also be treated with anti-viral medication and antibiotics.“In some situations that isn’t enough,” he says of the current outbreak. “The pneumonia went unabated and the patients did not survive.”Jenkins says Covid-19 pneumonia is different from the most common cases that people are admitted to hospitals for.“Most types of pneumonia that we know of and that we admit people to hospital for are bacterial and they respond to an antibiotic.Wilson says there is evidence that pneumonia caused by Covid-19 may be particularly severe. Wilson says cases of coronavirus pneumonia tend to affect all of the lungs, instead of just small parts.But Wilson says this “first responder mechanism” can be impaired in some groups, including people with underlying heart and lung conditions, diabetes and the elderly.Jenkins says that, generally, people aged 65 and over are at risk of getting pneumonia, as well as people with medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer or a chronic disease affecting the lungs, heart, kidney or liver, smokers, Indigenous Australians, and infants aged 12 months and under.“Age is the major predictor of risk of death from pneumonia. Pneumonia is always serious for an older person and in fact it used to be one of the main causes of death in the elderly. Now we have very good treatments for pneumonia.“It’s important to remember that no matter how healthy and active you are, your risk for getting pneumonia increases with age. This is because our immune system naturally weakens with age, making it harder for our bodies to fight off infections and diseases.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0eb763183be999a9984302df1e9b413ac8dc4af2/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=44a83a4fdb731be212cfdc73520da235","title":"coronavirus closes down italy","story":"With Italy in lockdown, Peter Beaumont charts the spread of Covid-19 in the country while Lorenzo Tondo describes its impact.

Follow the latest newsThe UK government has updated its coronavirus advice, following the latest emergency meeting of ministers and their advisers this afternoon. Here are the key points. Extinction Rebellion has announced that it is to postpone its next wave of protest, which had been due to start on 23 May. Sources within the environmental protest movement say they are planning an alternative “rebellion”, in an effort to support the struggle against the coronavirus outbreak that is spreading around the world. A statement sent to the  reads:Extinction Rebellion UK – as part of a wider movement – exists to protect life, both now and for future generations. Right now we all need to prioritise public health, follow advice from scientists and doctors, and be mindful of the most vulnerable in our communities. Mass public gatherings will not be organised by Extinction Rebellion if it is not safe to do so.As such we can no longer make a commitment to the date of May 23rd for in-person rebellion in London based on Covid-19. We will make alternative, creative plans for May and June, watch this space! We will return to London in future but can’t be certain of a date right now, so we ask rebels to continue mobilising, to be ready for when the time is right. We believe in the need for mass civil disobedience, until the Government responds adequately to the ongoing climate and ecological emergency. As the pandemic passes nothing will feel the same and we need to be ready, we are already in a state of planetary crisis, and we do not have to return to business as usual.Extinction Rebellion will continue to organise with, and support, our local communities and each other throughout this time of national and international emergency.More than 1,000 people in Italy have died as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak, according to the latest figures. According to Reuters:  The agency said that, of those originally infected, 1,258 had fully recovered compared to 1,045 the day before. Some 1,153 people were in intensive care against a previous 1,028.

Deliveroo HQ in London will be closed from tomorrow until at least 30 March, a leaked internal memo sent by the chief executive and founder, Will Shu, to staff reveals, Jedidajah Otte reports. I’m writing to provide another update on coronavirus. In recent days, governments around the world have also taken more aggressive measures as I’m sure you’ve read about. Given these rapidly changing conditions the exec team and I have made the decision to close HQ and require everyone to work from home.Dan Winn, the chief technology officer at Deliveroo, wrote in a separate message to staff at the company’s tech department, seen by the : This is a watershed moment for the company and for this team. Our business environment is changing rapidly. Consumer, rider and restaurant needs are evolving literally daily … In the midst of all this, we’re today transitioning our organisation to a completely new way of working: fully remote. It’s imperative that we get this right. Deliveroo has taken the precaution of temporarily closing its HQ office in London and employees will work from home. This is a safety-first approach that we will keep under review.The health minister in Wales, Vaughan Gething, has defended his government’s decision not to order the postponement of the Wales v Scotland rugby match, Steven Morris reports.Plaid Cymru has called for the game and other mass gatherings to be put off, but Gething said: “It’s really clear and really important that ministers are making choices guided by the best evidence and advice.” He said Wales was “actively considering” banning mass gatherings from next week.On closing schools, Gething said such a move was not appropriate at the moment. He said: “Ministers have had clear advice that closing schools now is not an appropriate step to take. That advice may change.”The chief medical officer for Wales, Dr Frank Atherton, said the expectation was that cases would start rising in early April and there may be a peak in May and June.Asked if there was any suggestion the pattern in the UK was not following that seen in Italy, he said: “We have to assume the pattern of transmission in Italy may be coming our way. We have to assume that.”Welsh Labour has announced it is postponing its annual conference as the Welsh Labour government devotes its full attention to responding to the outbreak. The conference was due to take place next month in Llandudno, north Wales. Boris Johnson said the coronavirus outbreak was “the worst public health crisis for a generation” and the number of cases could be “much higher” than had been confirmed.The prime minister said he had to “level with the British public that many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time”. We are now getting on to the next phase in that plan, because this is now not just an attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay the spread and thereby minimise the suffering.He said even if the peak of the disease was delayed by a “few weeks”, the NHS would be in a stronger position to handle it because of the improving weather, more beds would be available and there would be greater time for medical research. As well as advising that gatherings of 500 people or more be cancelled next week, Scotland’s first minister said overseas school trips should not go ahead and people with symptoms indicative of coronavirus should stay at home for seven days.Nicola Sturgeon told a press briefing that she was articulating a Scottish government position, not a UK-wide position, when advising that large gatherings should cancelled. “We will from the start of next week advise the cancellation of mass gatherings of over 500 people that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services,” she said.Though this move would not have a significant impact on the spread of the virus, Sturgeon said the government issued this advice to reduce the impact on policing and frontline health services during the outbreak. At first minister’s questions, Sturgeon said she was specifically referring to events that required policing and ambulance cover. “I am very clear that we are basing the decision on resilience issues and not simply on the action that we require to take to reduce the spread of the virus,” she said. “It is important that we recognise that those decisions have to be informed by the science but that there are wider implications that we all have to be mindful of.”The Scottish government will also be advising local authorities and schools that overseas school trips should be cancelled. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office would soon issue advice that aligned with that position, Sturgeon said.The first minister said schools, colleges and universities throughout the UK were currently not being advised to close. While the government would keep this issue under review, Sturgeon explained that closing schools could lead to children gathering in more informal settings and result in a greater spread of the virus. She added: “If it gets to the stage where the advice is to close schools, this will not be for a week or two weeks. This will be something that was advised to last throughout the peak of the infection and that is potentially until the summer period.”The Green party in England and Wales has cancelled its spring conference. The talks had been due to take place in Brighton on the weekend of 20-22 March.A statement on the Green party website reads: As a democratic party, conference plays an important role in determining policy and the overall direction of the party, as well as providing a space for training and discussion for members. However, it would not be responsible to continue with our plans given the ongoing situation. In lieu of conference, plans are already under way to provide members with access to fringe sessions and interaction opportunities online throughout the course of the weekend. We will be offering refunds of fees for those already booked. We hope that, given the party will face a significant financial loss as a result of this decision, those members that are able to consider foregoing this will do so.The local elections are scheduled to be held on Thursday 7 May in about 118 English local councils, eight directly elected mayors in England and 40 police and crime commissioners in England and Wales.More universities in England say they are stopping in-person lectures and classes and planning to switch to remote learning this month, Richard Adams, the ’s education editor, reports.The University of Durham and Manchester politan University (MMU) have announced that they will move to remote learning where possible, with Durham to begin from 16 March for the last week of term before its Easter holidays begin.Clare O’Malley, Durham’s global pro-vice-chancellor, told students in an email: If you wish to leave Durham following your last class this week, you can do so. Others of you will stay in Durham but will not be able to access your classrooms next week. We will make every effort to ensure that all of you can participate in classes remotely until the Easter break. MMU also said it was preparing for the possibility of switching its end of year exams to online assessments. Malcolm Press, the vice-chancellor of MMU, told students: We have decided to end face-to-face teaching at Manchester politan University from Friday 27 March, and potentially sooner, if requested by the government.Tutors across our faculties are now preparing to support this and will update you on how to access remaining teaching … To be prudent, the university is also planning how best to deliver assessments, exams and credits, should we need to change our usual processes for the summer term. We will update you on any changes as soon as possible.You will be free to go home for the Easter break from Friday 27 March or remain on campus and in halls as usual.Rodrigo Duterte, the president of the Philippines, has announced that the whole of  Manila, the country’s capital, is to be placed under quarantine, according to reports.All travel in and out of the capital will be halted from 15 March until 14 April, Duterte said after a meeting with an interagency taskforce on the Philippines’ response to the outbreak, according to a report in ABS-CBN News.

Photograph: Paul FaithAFP via  Getty ImagesThe National Public Health Emergency Team met on Wednesday night to review latest evidence of the spread of Covid-19 and made a recommendation that Ireland move to a new phase - the delay phase - in trying to prevent the spread of coronavirus.Their advice on next steps was sent by letter to Minister for Health Simon Harris earlier today (Thursday March 12th). This is what the letter said:Following the press briefing of 11th March which set out the need for enhancements to Ireland’s containment phase, the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) met at 9pm last night to discuss further notifications of Covid-19 by the National Virus Reference Laboratory.The NPHET now recommends that Ireland moves to a delay phase.In making this recommendation the NPHET noted that Ireland has now seen:(i) a significant increase in recent days in the number of cases detected(ii) a number of ICU hospitalisations(iv) a number of clusters of infection including in two hospital settings and(v) reports of community transmission in a number of inidual cases.The NPHET also took into account the advice of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control published yesterday, 11th March that:(i) the detection of Covid-19 cases andor deaths outside of known chains of transmission is a strong signal that social distancing measures should be considered and(ii) the early, decisive, rapid, coordinated and comprehensive implementation of closures and quarantines is likely to be more effective in slowing the spread of the virus than a delayed implementation.The NPHET now recommends the following measures to attenuate the spread of symptoms of Covid-19:1. Iniduals who have symptoms should self-isolate for a period of 14 days.2. Iniduals should reduce discretionary social contacts as much as possible .3. Elderly andor medically vulnerable people should reduce as much as possible contacts outside home. 4. There should be no mass gatherings:(a) involving more than 100 people if located indoors,(b) involving more than 500 people if located outdoors.5. Closure of museums, galleries and tourism sites.6. Closure to students of schools, crèches, other childcare facilities and higher education institutions. 7. Reduction of workplace contacts, and implementation of remote working practices and teleconferencing where possible and not to travel for meetings. Work time and break times should be staggered, where possible. 8. Restriction of visiting at hospitals, long term care settings, mental health facilities, prisons, and spacing measures in homeless shelters. The NPHET further recommends that these measures should be introduced from Friday 13 March until Sunday 29 March 2020. The NPHET will keep the impact of these measures under review.The NPHET agreed that it is critically important that the health sector should greatly strengthen contact tracing, surveillance and necessary public health actions in addition to the range of measures approved by the Cabinet Committee on Covid-19 last Monday 9 March.The NPHET will continue to advise on necessary actions and in particular, will give further consideration to travel and related measures at its meeting this evening.Chair of NPHET"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4199026.1583863765!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"how dutch false sense of security helped coronavirus spread","story":"Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte accidentally shakes the hand of a health official after announcing a no handshake policy. Video: Reuters\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDutch prime minister Mark Rutte gives Bruno Bruins, minister for medical care, an elbow greeting. Photograph: Remko De WaalEPAThe position of Dutch authorities was that only people with symptoms could transmit coronavirus. It was repeated by the government, national and local health authorities, justifying a cascade of decisions that allowed the Netherlands to keep up a “business as usual” attitude even as the virus exponentially spread.The problem was, it was wrong. As early as February 21st, Chinese doctors published a case of apparent asymptomatic transmission German doctors wrote to the New England Journal of Medicine on March 5th to warn of a case near Munich. The World Health Organisation advises transmission without symptoms is possible.Despite this the Dutch government and health authorities stuck to looser quarantine advice than other European countries up to the time of publishing, telling people who had travelled from China, outbreak spots in Italy, and Iran, that they need only self-quarantine if experiencing symptoms.As well as being underpinned by a flawed assumption, the advice relies on people knowing whether they have symptoms or not. This is questionable: Chris Higgins, a GP in Australia, provoked an outcry after treating 70 patients while he had what he thought was the tail end of a mild cold, before he tested positive for Covid-19.It’s also in stark contrast to the approach in the countries most successful at containing the virus, such as Taiwan and Singapore, where authorities drew on their experience of the Sars outbreak to implement strict travel checks and preventative quarantine before even registering a first confirmed case.Inidual freedomsThe case of the Netherlands shows how a flawed belief about transmission filtered down throughout society, enabling the virus to spread. It also makes for a grand experiment in what happens when a country takes a relaxed approach to the virus, placing the maintenance of normality, personal responsibility and inidual freedoms first.The first coronavirus diagnosis in the Netherlands was on February 27th. As authorities traced his contacts, they found he had attended Carnival in the city of Tilburg in the North Brabant region on February 21st-25th. “The patient was not contagious in the days he celebrated the carnival,” the mayor of Tilburg Theo Weterings told media.In the following days, two more people who were at Tilburg carnival were diagnosed with coronavirus. One of them was a worker at Bannink Packaging in Drenthe in the northern Netherlands. His partner was also infected.\u0026nbspBannink Packaging continued to operate as normal, saying the employee was not sick when he came to work. “The chance that he has infected colleagues is therefore rather small,” the spokesperson told media.On March 4th, another Bannink Packaging employee – who commuted from Germany – was diagnosed with coronavirus.\u0026nbsp“In Germany they are a lot stricter with testing . . . We should not exaggerate. Production continues as normal. In that respect, it is business as usual,” a company representative told media. “We advise our employees to stay at home if they have symptoms. We cannot do more.”On March 5th a third employee was diagnosed as positive.\u0026nbspOn March 7th four more people tested positive in Coevorden, where Bannink Packaging is based.That day 900 students of the university society Vindicat returned from a mass ski trip in Piedmont in northern Italy in a convoy of buses to the Netherlands. Amid public concern, authorities met the students and tested four, who were found negative.“Someone who has no symptoms is not contagious,” Jossy van den Boogaard, MD in infectious disease control at local health authority GGD Groningen told media.“Can the students also infect others while they have no symptoms? No,” was the official advice. “What if someone decides to go to work or take an exam? This is their own responsibility.”No panicOn March 8th it was announced that a cleaning lady married to a Bannink Packaging employee had tested positive. The director of the school she works at wrote to parents to say there was no reason to panic, and that children could go to school as normal.By this point the outbreak in the carnival region of North Brabant had reached the point that there were shortages of protective equipment for health workers, and people were advised not to call their doctor unless their symptoms were serious.Lawmaker Eva van Esch told parliament a friend of hers had tested positive who had been refused a test for a week after returning from Italy with symptoms. Once positive, the friend had been asked to keep the diagnosis quiet and not to tell her work or contacts, van Esch said.“My party therefore wonders whether this government is actually focusing on preventing the spread of the disease, or whether the health services are primarily concerned with preventing panic,” van Esch said.Dutch testing capacity is limited, forcing authorities to prioritise testing people with a clear link.

Photograph: Luke DrayGettyMichael Gove, the British cabinet minister who will negotiate the implementation of post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland, has declined to confirm that checks will be required on goods crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain to the North.Mr Gove told a House of Commons committee that it would be for an EU-UK joint committee to determine how the Northern Ireland protocol should work.“The effective working of the protocol is a matter for the joint committee to resolve and I’m looking forward to that meeting in order to ensure that we can develop the protocol and implement it in all its provisions in a way that ensures that the people of Northern Ireland and the Northern Ireland economy benefit,” he said.EU negotiators insist that the role of the joint committee, which is due to meet for the first time on March 30th, is limited to determining matters such as which goods are assumed to be destined to remain in Northern Ireland rather than exported to the EU. But the protocol makes clear that Northern Ireland will have to follow the EU customs code, which requires information and checks on goods coming from Great Britain.Irish Sea borderPrime minister Boris Johnson has stated a number of times that there will be no checks and no border in the Irish Sea but Mr Gove said the British government was committed to implementing the protocol in full.“We are committed to making sure that the Northern Ireland protocol is implemented in order to underpin the BelfastGood Friday Agreement. And the point is well understood that the joint committee is there to ensure that it is implemented and also to resolve some of the questions over precisely how,” he said.Mr Gove suggested that the next round of talks between Britain and the EU, which is scheduled to start in London next Wednesday, could be postponed because of the coronavirus outbreak. And he said the government would not publish an economic impact assessment of the free trade deal it is seeking from the EU.“I am personally sceptical of efforts to say that any given impact assessment by a government department is an accurate prediction of the future. As load-bearing devices go, they are perhaps not the most effective ways of delivering a proper range of views about what the economic consequences of a course of action might be,” he said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

There were 299 active coronavirus cases in Britain on Monday, up from 32 at the start of last week – an increase of 834 per cent over the seven days. It took four days for the UK\u0027s number of cases to last double, from 106 on March 5 to 299 on March 9, putting the country in the middle of the pack in terms of the doubling rate of the virus.This is less than the rate of increase in Spain, where active cases have doubled in just two days. There, 460 people were said to have the virus, but that had increase to 1,013 on Monday.The doubling rate is, however, lower in countries in which the virus is already more established and has infected more people. In Japan and South Korea, for example, it took coronavirus nine days to last double its number of active cases.The countries with the highest number of recorded active cases as of Monday were China (18,880), Italy (7,985) and South Korea (7,307).It is important to note that other countries may have higher undetected cases because the official numbers are reliant upon rigorous testing and data collection methods in each country.The number of active cases in China – and in Hubei province, the epicentre of the virus – has fallen over the last week. Hubei has seen active cases drop by 40 per cent since last Monday, while in China the number has dropped by 67 per cent.While cases are still rising in South Korea, the country\u0027s rate of growth has slowed with cases currently doubling every nine days. The most concerning trajectory is in Italy, which has the second highest number of confirmed active cases and is currently seeing that number double every three days. The main goal for the UK Government as it faces coronavirus is to contain and delay it – part of its four-point contain, delay, research and mitigate strategy.This timeline is defined by the likely progress of an outbreak in five scenarios as it moves across Europe, and is taken from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the EU\u0027s main public health body. But looking at case data from across Europe, it\u0027s clear that different European countries are at different stages of this strategy – and with different levels of success.Most countries managed to delay major surges in cases for at least 20 days as the number of infections in Europe remained low.Daily data sourced from the World Health Organisation and compiled by John Hopkins University shows that some of the worst affected countries were able to contain the disease for weeks.In Italy, the first substantial increase in active cases (533 per cent) did not occur for 21 days after the country had detected its first case. The UK is following a similar trajectory, with a 400 per cent increase in active cases after 24 days.Countries detecting the virus later appear to be less successful in keeping numbers low. In Austria, Switzerland, Norway and the Netherlands, the virus was detected for the first time less than two weeks ago. But once it was present, each country saw the number of confirmed cases double – or even triple – in the first three days.Francois Balloux, a professor of computational systems biology at University College London, told The  he thought it likely that the UK would follow the same pattern as Italy over the coming weeks.The trajectory of the epidemic in the UK is so far roughly comparable to the one in Northern Italy, but with the epidemic in northern Italy two to three weeks ahead of the situation in the UK, he said.The above graphic shows the speed at which cases increased in Italy. While lagging in total numbers, confirmed cases in the UK have doubled roughly once every three days in the last week, suggesting that Britain is on much the same track.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bordeaux bows french thirst craft beer amid record drop domestic","story":"Young French people’s growing taste for craft beer has hurt sales of Bordeaux with the wine growing region partly blaming dwindling domestic consumption, which fell to its lowest level in two decades last year, on their newfound thirst for a pint.According to figures released this week by the Bordeaux wine board, CIVB, domestic sales of their wine, which accounts for 54 per cent worldwide, fell by ten per cent last year to 130 million bottles.“We’ve lost a fifth of our volumes in France in five years, mainly wines in the €3-5 bracket,” said Bernard Farges, CIVB president. “Consumers are drinking less alcohol less often, in smaller quantities and are moving away from red wines in favour of chilled wines like rosé as well as beer.”According to an internal study, out of 100 unsold bottles of Bordeaux, some 64 remain on shelves due to the French simply cutting down on drink four are due to consumers choosing wines from other regions and 32 down to customers choosing other types of alcohol, essentially craft beer. Sales of craft beer are expected to have doubled since 2016 by year’s end to €440m (£384m). The number of microbreweries in France has risen from 200 to more than 1,600 in a decade.The shock figures have prompted unprecedented soul-searching in Bordeaux, which according to BFMTV has historically had a “superiority complex in the French wine world”.“The trend is towards moderation and it is hitting all appellations and all alcohol producers,” argued Mr Farges, who said that Bordeaux had the added problem of often being equated with “tradition, heritage and expensiveness” rather than the “supple, fruity wines that are easy to drink” that are in vogue.To counter the drop, he said Bordeaux intended to give more pride of place to the “faces” of Bordeaux winegrowers who beyond producers of top Grands Crus also included “hipsters, creatives and crazy people”.While international sales held steady last year at €2bn, storm clouds are gathering for French wine and Bordeaux in particular.Exports to China, which represents roughly 25 per cent of all Bordeaux wine sales, dropped by 17 per cent to the mainland and by 25 per cent to Hong Kong last year.Meanwhile, the region has been hit by Donald Trump’s decision last October to target wine with 25 per cent taxes as part of America’s trade war with Europe. While sales to the US grew slightly over the past year, they plummeted in the last quarter with a loss of value of 36 per cent overall.Despite Brexit, Britain offered a silver lining as Bordeaux’s third market, with imports of claret jumping 15 per cent to €260 million.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"christian group poland launches netflix alternative stream content","story":"A Christian organisation in Poland has launched an alternative to Netflix\u0027s video-on-demand service by streaming content that using the power of film, leads you to God. Katoflix offers films, documentaries and interviews that it regards as wholesome and possible to show your children without fear. The service has been created by Studio Katolik, a media company run by the Salvatorian Congregation, a Catholic organisation. Bringing five new features each week to its users the platform operates under the Latin slogan, “Vide Opera Dei”, which translates as “See the Works of God”.On offer now, for a fee of about £2 per video, viewers can stream the film Heidi, watch an interview with a priest entitled \u0027Our Life in the Bible,\u0027 or a documentary on the “dark side” of Dan Brown’s book The Da Vinci Code. “We want to offer you products that you can show your children without fear, recommend to friends or to give to someone who is experiencing a difficult moment in their life,” the service says on its website. “Our dream is to create a space, which, using the power of film, will lead you to God.”It also comes with the bonus that users will be supporting the “production of native Christian films”.While it is too early to see how popular the new service will be in Poland, a country that remains a bastion of the Catholic Church in Europe, Polish media experts have linked its launch to controversy surrounding some of Netflix’s content.A television thriller called Messiah about a man coming from the Middle East who claims to be the returning Jesus, attracted criticism in Poland, with Catholics using web forums to brand it “dangerous”.Earlier this year Jaroslaw Gowin, a deputy prime minister, called on Netflix to remove a Portuguese comedy called The First Temptation of Christ, which implies Jesus had a gay lover.

It means public health officials have accepted that widespread exposure is inevitable and are now focused on slowing the spread rather than preventing it.Population distancing strategies – such as closures of schools, the cancelling of large-scale gatherings like football matches and concerts – are likely to be brought in. Most people will be encouraged to work from home. Although an entire lockdown such as China\u0027s seems unlikely, recent studies have shown that it dramatically limited spread, and so similar measures to quarantine cities and limit public transport may be considered. Ministers say they will weigh up the benefits of delaying the peak against the social impact of shutting down large parts of society, and will be taking advice from scientists. The next two phases are the research and mitigation stages. Research is already under way to develop diagnostic tests, antiviral drugs and vaccines.If significant numbers of people become infected, the mitigation stage will be enacted to minimise the overall impact on society, public services and the economy. During the mitigation phase, the Government is planning for large numbers of NHS and emergency workers being infected and unable to work.Contingency plans are in place to bring back retired doctors and nurses and to allow the army to take over some duties.

I have therefore developed these new measures in order to further improve safety.The report shows that smart motorways account for fewer deaths per motorist than normal motorways, but more serious injuries.Mr Shapps paid tribute to the families of people killed on smart motorways, who have campaigned for a government review.It is hoped that improved safety will be achieved by recruiting more traffic police, rolling out a stationary vehicle detection system across the network within the next 36 months and bringing emergency refuge areas – the safe havens currently spaced just over a mile apart – closer together.Mr Shapps wants Highways England, a Government-owned company, to reduce the distance between refuges to between three-quarters of a mile to a mile where possible, so motorists travelling at 60mph reach one every 45 seconds.Engineers will then introduce more signs telling motorists where the nearest refuge areas are. More gantries will be built to control the flow of traffic, as well as stricter enforcement of red X signs to make motorists avoid lanes and allow emergency vehicles to reach accidents.There will also be a £5 million public awareness campaign to try to educate the motoring public about what to do in an emergency. Advice about how to drive on the routes will be included in the Highway Code.Sections of smart motorway that are found to have experienced clusters of crashes will be monitored. However, critics said Mr Shapps had kicked the ball into the long grass and his measures were insufficient to protect motorists who fail to reach an emergency refuge area. Claire Mercer, whose husband, Jason, was killed on the M1 near Sheffield – among four people The  identified as perishing there after failing to reach an emergency refuge area – said Mr Shapps\u0027 review had failed to address the concerns of many relatives of those who died.I feel this is a series of half-measures and compromises, she said. I don\u0027t think the minister and his team have listened to our concerns. They are also not taking seriously how relatives of those killed are prosecuting Highways England for removing the hard shoulder, leading to an increase in deaths. The Government is actually announcing more smart motorways – that means the loss of hard shoulders.Mrs Mercer claims that, during a 30-minute conversation with the minister on Wednesday, he failed to allay her fears that Highways England staff do not have suitable technology or manpower to spot stationary vehicles. She also claims he had no adequate explanation for how his review will help paramedics and police quickly clear traffic to reach accidents without a hard shoulder. Freedom of Information statistics have shown that manual CCTV operators take, on average, 20 minutes to spot a static vehicle in a live lane before closing that lane to traffic.Over the last nine months, The  has revealed the anguish of those who lost loved ones after their vehicles broke down. The investigation also showed how coroners were issuing prevention of future death reports to Highways England, demanding to know what more could be done to protect people who failed to reach an emergency refuge area. Mrs Mercer spoke to the  last year about her husband\u0027s needless death before launching a campaign called Smart Motorways Kill.Meera and Dilesh Naran also gave their first interview to this newspaper to reveal that their eight-year-old son, Dev, had been killed on the M6 after the car he was in stopped on the hard shoulder, which had been opened to traffic. Emma Brown, the coroner holding the boy\u0027s inquest, demanded that Highways England explain what more could be done to prevent further deaths because it had no technology to quickly spot stranded motorists.Earlier this year, it was revealed that a student was killed and two others left in a coma after the university people carrier they were in came to a halt before reaching an emergency refuge on the M1.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland closes schools colleges uk heads delay phase coronavirus","story":"Anyone entering Ireland will be informed of the measures and asked to self-isolate if they are displaying symptoms, the Irish premier added.

The\u0026nbspdigital services tax of 2 per cent on large technology companies\u0027 revenues\u0026nbspis designed to stop the Exchequer missing out on profits shifted into tax havens. It\u0027s expected to raise £440m a year.Arun Birla, a partner at law firm\u0026nbspPaul Hastings warned that implementing the tax will not be easy. Whilst Spain and Italy are following suit, implementing their own unilateral taxes, what is really needed is a multijurisdictional approach that encompasses all nations, preventing them from implementing multiple versions of what is fundamentally the same legislation, he said.\u0026nbspThat said, setting up a global policy is no mean feat, and will only be achieved if all countries have the desire to do so.”Entrepreneurs relief, a tax break for business owners that costs £2bn a year,\u0026nbspwill be substantially reduced.\u0026nbspThe government will cut the total amount of relief an inidual can claim over their lifetime from £10m to £1m, saving around £6bn\u0026nbspfor the public purse over this parliament.\u0026nbspLess than one in ten claimants say\u0026nbspthe relief was an incentive to set up their business, and it is unfair, with three quarters of the cost going to just 5,000 iniduals, Mr\u0026nbspSunak said.There was bad news for the economy, however,\u0026nbspas the OBR again cut its forecast for growth and\u0026nbspproductivity.The chancellor forecasts the UK economy will grow 1.1 per cent this year, before taking into account any hit from coronavirus.

They are recommending hazmat suits. Hazmat. Suits.”“Please tell me this is fake,” one follower replied, only to be given confirmation that the disclaimer was indeed real.For most people, the coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are among the stars to confirm they’ve tested positive for the virus, while a number of entertainment projects have been delayed or postponed as a result of the pandemic.Find a full list of everything that’s been affected in the wake of the outbreak here.The Book of Mormon\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

During the interview, DeGeneres asked SZA about recently appearing on the cover of Rolling Stone.“I just want to ask you … was it hot?” DeGeneres asked, in reference to SZA wearing a bikini top on the cover. “Oh, sis!” Timberlake interrupted.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs SZA began to speak, Timberlake continued to answer DeGeneres’ question for her. “What are you doing to them, sis?”Timberlake continued to interject while SZA answered the question, ultimately adding: “Sometimes y’all got to let ‘em know, ‘I’ve been workin’ out’.”Tom Hanks and wife Rita Wilson test positive for coronavirusHarvey Weinstein told Kate Beckinsale to ‘not look like a lesbian’On Twitter, many were confused by Timberlake’s accent during the exchange, and by his repeated interruptions.“Why is he talking like that and over her?” asked one viewer. “I don’t like that he’s saying sis,” read one reply.Others criticised Timberlake for using African American vernacular and slang.“JT is the definition of white people changing their dialect around black people,” read one tweet. “Call it mental illness.”Timberlake and SZA have collaborated on single “The Other Side”, the theme song for the forthcoming animated musical Trolls World Tour.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Those would not be able to happen in time to ensure that the mission could be successful, they said.While those further tests would have been required anyway, the spread of coronavirus compromised the final phase of activities ahead of the launch, the space agencies said.It was unclear whether the coronavirus would have caused the mission to be delayed without those other problems, officials said.The dirty truth about washing your handsWhat is the difference between Covid-19 and the common cold and flu?Can face masks really protect you against coronavirus or flu?The UK government\u0027s four stages of fighting coronavirus explainedWhat are symptoms of coronavirus – and where has it spread?We have made a difficult but well-weighed decision to postpone the launch to 2022, said\u0026nbspRoscosmos\u0026nbspdirector general Dmitry Rogozin. It is driven primarily by the need to maximise the robustness of all ExoMars systems as well as force majeure circumstances related to exacerbation of the epidemiological situation in Europe which left our experts practically no possibility to proceed with travels to partner industries.I am confident that the steps that we and our European colleagues are taking to ensure mission success will be justified and will unquestionably bring solely positive results for the mission implementation.The mission will now target a launch in 2022. The planets must align correctly for such launches to take place, meaning that the window only opens for around 10 days every two years.Created with Sketch.

And it now has a folding screenThe Samsung Galaxy Z Flip is the South Korean manufacturer’s second folding phone. The first was the Galaxy Fold, which was essentially a tablet that folded in half to be the size of a regular smartphone. Great if you want a tablet that’s pocketable.But the original folding phones of 20 years ago had a different purpose: to offer everything a regular phone did but in a much more pocketable form factor. And that’s what the Z Flip is aiming to do, as well.When it’s folded, the Galaxy Z Flip is the size and shape of – and everyone I’ve shown it to has said this first – a make-up compact. This doesn’t mean it’s only aimed at women, for sure, but it fits any bag or trouser pocket with ease. The shiny, gloss-black finish is highly attractive and also comes in a similarly opulent purple hue. The smooth feel, the manageable size and the curved edges make it highly tactile, something you can roll effortlessly through your fingers. Even the hinge, with the etched-in company name on the end, is pleasing to the touch.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOpen the lid and you suddenly have a large-screen phone, the 6.7in screen stretching across the entire inside face. Unlike almost every other smartphone, there’s a raised ridge around the entire display. That’s because although the screen itself is glass – yes, foldable glass! – to protect it, there’s a plastic film stretched tight across the glass and the ridge is what anchors it in place.Run your finger across the display and it mostly doesn’t feel any different to a regular screen. Until you hit the middle. There’s a crease there, which is unmissable to the touch. If light falls on the display, the crease is also visible. As you close the screen, the light coming from the crease is brighter.Created with Sketch.Gadget and tech news: In pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

When you’re watching a video, there’s no image distortion as you might imagine. It looks like a regular OLED smartphone screen: sharp, colourful and vibrant.There’s a small screen on the outer case of the phone, next to the dual cameras. This tiny screen shows the time and some other notifications when you tap the little display twice.There’s a fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy Z Flip, situated in the power button positioned on the right edge. It’s fast and accurate.Opening and closing the phone requires a certain dexterity. You can’t flip it violently open like Captain Kirk opening his Communicator. I mean, you can, but it feels dangerous, like the thin phone might snap in two. It wouldn’t, but it’s part of the way you feel you need to handle the Galaxy Z Flip with kid gloves. It’s also not waterproof, as many flagships are these days – and the £1,300 price tag tells you this is a flagship.But the bottom line is this is a very enjoyable phone to use: the pocket fit is just great – it takes time to get used to how little space it takes up. The display is attractive and bigger than an iPhone 11 Pro Max, for instance.Performance is good, with a decent, though not quite top-level, processor ensuring that everything happens fast. The phone feels responsive and powerful.It also has good battery life, running for a full day with ease and charging quickly enough. It is wireless-chargeable and even has Wireless Powershare, where placing another phone against the folded Z Flip will charge the other handset. It works with any wireless-chargeable phone, from any brand or other gadgets such as AirPods Pro or Samsung Galaxy Buds.Cameras are a crucial part of every smartphone and the Galaxy Z Flip has three. On the display there’s a single 10MP lens which peeps out from the display, at the top in the middle. On the outer case there are two 12MP cameras, one wide and one ultra-wide. Other top-flight cameras often feature more than two rear cameras but the two here are perfectly good, just no match for the leaders in this respect, the iPhone 11 Pro and Huawei Mate 30 Pro.You can use the rear cameras for selfies, as well as the inside one. To see what the lens is looking at, you close the phone, double-press the power button and a preview appears on the little external display.This is a fascinating phone, offering something tangibly different from the rest of the phones out there, which are invariably flat slabs of glass and\u0026nbspmetal. It is easy to use and a great deal of fun.Inside Samsung’s pivotal struggle to deliver Galaxy FoldAfter just a week or so of use, the novelty of being able to put a big-screen phone into a small pocket has not worn off.But there are also compromises. It doesn’t feel as solid as most other phones – though those need to be protected in cases. Samsung has thoughtfully included a two-piece transparent case which clips on to keep the phone scratch-free.Will it last as long as other phones? The hinge is solid and feels like it will be long-lasting. But the display’s protective screen is less hardy and may sustain scratches.Samsung Galaxy Z Flip proves that a folding phone is an enticing prospect and, although there are concerns about durability, this phone largely succeeds.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It had these weird eyes staring out looking to the sides. There’s nothing like this alive today.“It’s just incredible to uncover this new ecological niche we never even knew existed.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The government will start a consultation on whether to grant local authorities more powers to tackle the issue. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe announcement came in response to a report issued by the Transport Select Committee in September 2019 which sought to ban the “blight” of pavement parking throughout England. Witnesses had told MPs that in some cases pavement parking caused disabled, vulnerable and elderly people to feel trapped, leaving some “afraid to leave their homes”.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak poses for pictures with the Budget Box outside 11 Downing Street ahead of Britain\u0027s first post-Brexit budgetA Tate Modern gallery assistant interacts with the \u0027Silver Clouds\u0027 installation, at a press view of major new Andy Warhol exhibition at Tate Modern, which features classic pop art pieces and works never shown before in the UKThe Sub Dean and Canon Paster of Southwark, Canon Michael Rawson, left,  blesses the statue of Santa Barbara and workers on one of the sites of the Thames Tideway Tunnel in London.

This will look at a variety of options - including giving local authorities extended powers to crack down on this behaviour.Huw Merriman, who chairs the Transport Select Committee, said there was “much to praise” in the DfT’s announcement, but warned that previous government reviews had not succeeded in improving roadside conditions. This government has signalled an intent to finally deliver change. We now need a detailed timeframe from the Department for Transport to ensure this happens,” he said.Drive-thru coronavirus test station opens in UK car parkMan shot dead in row over parking spaceHowever, the AA has said that a total ban may have “unintended consequences”, potentially leading to more widespread “parking chaos”.Jack Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA, said: We absolutely agree that people who park in an anti-social way should be penalised. Many drivers in narrow streets are tempted to partially park on the\u0026nbsppavement\u0026nbspso emergency services and refuse trucks can pass.”An outright ban could lead to unintended consequences with\u0026nbspparking\u0026nbspchaos becoming more widespread. A better solution would be for councils to make a street-by-street assessment and where\u0026nbsppavement\u0026nbspparking\u0026nbspcould be allowed it be clearly marked and signed,” he added.

We expect this shortfall to be partly reversed as the specifics of the trading relationship are clarified, hence reducing uncertainty.\u0026nbspBut, working in the other direction, we expect the adverse effect of higher trade barriers to build through our five-year forecast period and beyond.Figures released by the Office for National Statistics this morning show that the economy has flat-lined, even before the effects of coronavirus bite.\u0026nbspThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

DNA results show that the hatchlings were, in fact, reproduced through parthenogenesis!Parthenogenesis is unusual, with the first cases recorded in 2006 in the UK at both London and Chester Zoo, according to Scientific American.The publication explained how it works, saying: In parthenogenesis, the mother\u0027s half-set of chromosomes doubles up to generate the full complement. Hence, the offspring derives all its genes from the mother, but they are not a duplicate of her genome.They reported that only 0.1 percent of all vertebrate are able to reproduce asexually.Komodo dragon attacks tourist in Indonesia national parkExplaining how parthenogenesis developed, the zoo wrote that the process developed in the wild due to their isolated nature.In the wild,\u0026nbspKomodo\u0026nbspdragons mainly live isolated and often become violent when approached, which has allowed these animals to evolve to reproduce both sexually and parthenogenetically.Announcing the news, the zoo playfully posted: Our Komodo Dragon hatchling DNA results are in!*Maury Voice* Kadal, you are NOT the father!Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These materials are provided in English and nine additional languages from affected areas, and are available at all international airports, ports and international train stations.“We are testing established arrangements already in place for caring for unwell people arriving at airports to make sure the system is ready locally. We are also providing guidance and briefing to staff, so they know what to expect and how best to respond.”Public Health Englands medical director, Prof Yvonne Doyle, said that washing hands with soap and water is more effective than wearing a face mask, although face masks are important for staff to use in hospitals when dealing with suspected cases.On March , Boris Johnson revealed the governments battle plan to tackle the spread of Covid-.During a press conference at No, the British Prime Minister said: The army is of course always ready as and when, but that is under the worst case scenario.Contingency plans are in place for anything from a mild pandemic through to a severe prolonged pandemic as experienced in  known as Spanish Flu.Police could also be told to switch their focus to only tackle serious crime  emergency services start to buckle under pressure."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus uk n95 surgical face masks","story":"The masks are generally used in industry, or to protect against poor air quality like in cities like Bejing.N masks are disposable face masks that are proven to filter the air to an industrial standard.Manufacturers y, but the N is a stamp from the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to show that it is efficient, which comes with a logo.They are used to stop you from breathing in hazardous small particles, such as dust, mold or aerosol paint particles.

We had another who actually had both legs from his left side amputated.“They’ll usually start with the legs because it doesn’t kill the dog, so it means that the adrenaline is pumping around the dogs system.“They believe that the longer they can keep the dog alive while they’re preparing the meat, the better it will be for them.”The charity has rescued , dogs since it was set up in , but millions more have ended up being maimed and slaughtered in an industry estimated to be worth over £m worldwide.Emily, who usually lives in the north east province of Harbin but is back in Devon because of the coronavirus outbreak, tells Sun Online: “Knowing that humans are capable of that is probably the hardest part.”Every June, in the south east city of Yulin, thousands of dogs are slaughtered, butchered, cooked and eaten for the ten-day Lychee and Dog Meat Festival, where some believe the fruit and meat combination will bring health through the long winter months.Footage from last year’s event, which showed a dog being blowtorched alive, caused outrage around the world.But the thousands slaughtered at Yulin are just a drop in the ocean for a legal trade that sees million dogs slaughtered worldwide annually.Although it’s not part of the mainstream Chinese diet, China is the worlds largest dog meat market, with , tonnes produced each year. A recent pork shortage sent the price sky high and boosted sales of dog products.Despite producers claiming the meat comes from legal ‘dog meat farms’, the lucrative trade has also led to an epidemic of dog thefts from pet owners, with one study finding that  per cent of households in one village lost a dog in the last few years.Gangs of dog thieves capture strays and pets, sometimes through the use of anaesthetic-tipped needles shot from blow pipes or crossbows.Dogs are typically bludgeoned to death in front of each other, put into a de-hairing machine to remove fur, and then blowtorched for sale to markets.“I went to many slaughterhouses where we saw collars,” says Peter Li, Associate Professor of East Asian Politics at the University of Houston-Downtown. “Some dogs even had a jacket on.“I witnessed the dogs waiting to be slaughtered, they were trembling and huddling with each other.They slaughtered all the dogs in the morning but they’d left  dogs for the next day. All these twelve dogs stood in a pool of blood.In December , Chinese police in Anhui province arrested a gang that sold nearly , poisonous syringes to dog thieves.In the same month, a court in Fujian province sentenced a dog thief in a rural village to death for trying to shoot a dog with a poisoned dart but accidentally killing a pregnant woman.Meanwhile, last May a gang of  people in Jiangsu province were sentenced to between one and six years in prison for poisoning and stealing dogs, then selling more than ,kg of dog meat worth , yuan .Food safety laws are often broken by the dog traders, who smuggle the animals across borders without legitimate paperwork.But this gives activists a chance to intervene, by stopping cramped trucks in quiet country lanes and reporting them.“They’ll call the local authorities because they know these dogs shouldn’t be on the trucks - they’re being illegally transported,” says Emily.“There are so many local activists, they’ll actually try to barricade the trucks to allow them to have that time for the local authorities [to arrive].“Then the dogs get handed over to organisations such as ourselves.”After being checked for disease, and given vaccination jabs, the dogs are taken into the Harbin shelter before being re-homed around the world.“With a lot of them, we need to spend a lot of time behaviourally just to build up trust,” says Emily.Emily - who founded the Harbin SHS centre with fellow dog lovers Aimee Clark and Hayley Hayes - originally went to China to travel and teach but, missing her family dog, she volunteered at a the only dog home in the area.I didnt know anything about the dog meat trade and it was a massive eye opener, she said.I didnt know that anything like that existed over there. You cant really close your eyes once you know that thats going on. Then I met the other two girls, and they were very similar in their mindset.Hayley initially found five dogs that needed help and the three girls decided to set up a rescue home.We started with these five dogs. And then it went from five dogs to , then  and , and it just built from there.Despite the booming trade, there are an increasing number of pet lovers in China as well as growing opposition to the slaughter of dogs.“Animal lovers are winning the debate,” says Peter Li. “The other side are absolutely on the defensive.”In , the Humane Society Internationalhanded over a letter signed by .million people calling for an end to the annual Yulin Dog Meat Festival, supported by  Chinese animal protection groups.Clare Bass, UK Director of HSI, said: “Contrary to the assumptions by many in the West, most people in China don’t eat dogs and in fact they are horried at the thought of a trade that takes their canine companions away from them.”As the coronavirus outbreak saw the Chinese government introducing laws banning the sale and consumption of wild animals, one South China city, Shenzhen, also drafted legislation which explicitly bans eating dog meat.It is still not illegal to kill and eat dogs in the UK and campaign groups claim the lack of a ban sets a bad example to other countries where the practice is more common.Giles Watling, MP for Clacton, agrees the law should change here.“Because we’re a world leader in animal welfare, we need to wave the flag to the rest of the world,” he says.“What we can do is pass a law that outlaws the consumption of dog and cat meat. It’s not for us to dictate to other cultures what they should or should not eat, but it’s for us to say: ‘this is what we do,you like it, follow us’.”For Emily, the hard work continues but it does have its rewards.The yearly bill, supported by donations, is more than £, and Emily estimates she’s spent around £, of her own money on the rescue effort.“I wouldn’t change it for a thing, at all, they’re worth everything, she says.When see the happy ever afters, the dogs with the final families and living the lives that they deserve to live, that feels feels pretty good. You can follow Slaughterhouse Survivors on Instagram at https:www.instagram slaughterhouse_survivors Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s the happiest day collectively I remember experiencing in the UK since the  London Olympics.We backed Prince Harry in his ious good causes like the Invictus Games.And we saluted the daring approach Meghan was making to modernising the Royal Family. I welcomed her approach and had much excitement that she could finish what Princess Diana had started.But there was criticism too. And aside from the vile trolls in that cesspit otherwise known as social media, most of it was fair and balanced.Like, for example, the couple preaching about our carbon footprints and the need to change our behaviour, while taking four private jet flights in  days.They may not have liked it, but they clearly thought about those objections because the couple now claim they will do what they can to fly commercially.There were many objections from within the Royal Family about the couple’s behaviour and demands – and there are two sides to this story.Many courtiers will tell you Harry and Meghan were rude and didn’t respect the hierarchy and pecking order that’s essential for smooth royal operations.But those close to Harry and Meghan have a very dferent perspective. They’ve told me that the couple felt they were under attack by royal staff members and other households from day one.We worried about the obvious changes to Harry, who went from happy go lucky to angry and brittle.We also questioned why so many of Meghan’s old friends and family members – including her own father Thomas – were no longer in her le.From a personal perspective, I value my school friends and blood relatives more than anyone  because they’ve known me for so long and know how to bring me down to earth whenever that might be required.But those small criticisms pale into insignicance when you compare the column inches and media coverage devoted to the issues that Harry and Meghan care about.Watching Meghan on stage at Robert Clack School in Dagenham working the crowd of teenagers like a true Hollywood princess, it’s very obvious the Royal Family are about to lose a superstar – and no one is celebrating that.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I see this for myself in my home town of Margate, where the rows of boarded up shops in the centre create a mood of permanent despair.In fact, for all the recent talk of regeneration in the Kent coastal town, it remains in the top one per cent of most deprived neighbourhoods in England.In the wake of Coronavirus, the Chancellor this week must take steps to ensure that businesses can stillthrough the crisis.Among the measures he should consider is a temporary suspension in VAT or employers’ national insurance so firms don’t suddenly run out of cash.He might also introduce a scheme whereby tax payments could be spread out over a longer period.Butthe roots of a retail revival are to go deeper, then the Conservative government will have to embark on genuine reform of business rates, which are currently penalising too many retailers.“Business rates are having a catastrophic effect on the high street. The system we have got at the moment is absolute lunacy,” says Tony Brown, the former chief executive of the retail chain Beales, which is now being closed with the loss of , jobs.As Mr Brown points out, in some cases the rates bill for a Beales store was  times as much as the rent, an unsustainable position.In this second decade of the st century, the Government is meant to be encouraging enterprise, but this mismanaged, unjust system does the exact opposite.As the commercial equivalent of the council tax, the unorm business rate — which is set by central government but collected by local authorities — is a levy paid by companies, supposedly based on the notional rental value of the premises they occupy.But it has become badly distorted by continual tinkering and changes in retail practices.Ministers still like it because it brings in a large amount of revenue, over £billion-a-year, and it is dficult to avoid.But it is riddled with absurdities and inconsistencies.For a start, it bears no relationship to how a retail business is performing.As John Webber, head of ratings at Colliers International global estate services company, puts it, “retailers are paying a disproportionate slice of UK business rate bills, and this burden is based purely on the size and value of their properties, no matter how well their businesses are doing.”In addition, it is a tax that punishes high street firms while favouring cyberspace and out-of-town operators with far cheaper premises.In a justiably angry recent outburst, James Daunt, the head of the Watersones book chain, complained that the business rates system is “hollowing out the high street” and shting work “to God-awful warehouses.In a classic example of this destructive bias, the business rates bill for Amazon in  was just £.million, despite UK sales of nearly £.billion.Yet the fashion chain Next, with  stores, had to pay a business rates bill almost £million more than Amazon.The trouble doesnt end there.Businesses with a property of a rateable value of less than £, are eligible for  per cent tax relief, whereas stores with a property value of over £, get no relief at all.In addition, firms can be hurt by transitional relief, which is meant to act like a shock-absorber in gradually phasing in changes in the size of tax bills after any revaluation of properties.Transitional relief might be beneficial when rental values are rising because it gives business ratepayers several years to adjust to increases.But since the last valuation in , retail firms increasingly inhabit a world where commercial rents are falling.Because transitional relief also slows down reductions in bills, this means that many businesses are now paying far more than they really should, given the lower values of their properties.In one branch of Poundland in Blackpool, for example, the business rate should have fallen by  per cent between  and  because of the drop in rental values.Instead, misnamed transitional relief means that by  it will have gone down in real terms by only  per cent.“Transitional relief  I call it comic relief. It needs to be scrapped,” says Poundland’s boss Barry Williams.The Government has tinkered with business rates for years, but all this has achieved is more frustration and complexity.Real reform is needed so that the spirit of enterprise is rewarded rather than punished.Buoyed by their recent election result, the Tories talk about “levelling up the economy” through major infrastructure projects and new transport links.Butthey really want to make an immediate dference, they will focus on helping our high streets.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On housing we have taken a step back, generationally.Whereas my family could be certain of a secure home with a rent we could afford, too many young people today will never know what a stable foundation like that can do for them.A proper home lets people get on with their lives, get their children into a good school, start a business, get involved in the community.These are great British traits that the Conservative Party should be fighting for every day. After all, we created Right To Buy, which has been a great source of stability and mobility for millions, and a triumph of Tory values.However, we now need to reorient the policy so the great opportunities we continue to offer to people with Right To Buy are more than matched by building new social housing to replace what we sell.This is importantwe want to give more people the same chance I had. Shelter recently found there was a net loss of , council houses last year as a result of demolitions and properties sold off through Right To Buy.This is happening while thousands of hard-working families sit on social housing waiting lists, desperate for a shot at the stability they cannot find anywhere .Runaway house prices mean owning your own home has become a distant dream for many lower-paid workers — receptionists, hospital porters, teaching assistants.These hard-working people still deserve a secure home. In the past  years alone house prices in England have grown at twice the pace of wages.The average home increased in value by  per cent between  and , while wages only grew by  per cent.Investing in social housing should be a deeply Conservative ideal. It gives people a  on which to build their lives, to progress and to grow. It is an essential element of a society that values social mobility.After all, it was a Conservative-led council in Liverpool that built the first ever council house as far back as .At last year’s General Election, people up and down the country, many from poorer backgrounds and living in social housing, put their trust in the Conservative Party to deliver for them.If our policies simply continue to provide only expensive new-builds for the already well-off, and almost unaffordable rents for the rest, then people might be left wonderingthat trust was misplaced.By building up our nation’s social housing and ensuring there is sufficient stock of affordable homes, we can give people a chance of a good home and deliver on our promises of fairness and aspiration.There is a world of dference between my childhood home and the grim high-rises that have come to define social housing for many today.But done right, new social housing can create thriving community hubs, minimise crime and be as appealing as new garden villages and towns. You need only to look at Goldsmith Street, the award-winning new development in Norwich, to know this vision is achievable.But warm words alone won’t build good-quality, affordable homes. We need money to build, and the Budget is a chance to signal the party is serious about tackling housing inequality head on.I’ve led a group of  fellow Conservative MPs from across the country and one Conservative metro mayor to call on the Chancellor to let our voters know whose side we are on. We have sent him a letter, an edited version of which is above.Many of us have felt the benefits of social housing in our own lives and we want the next generation to have the same shot at success we did. I hope our new Chancellor listens to our call in his Budget.A secure home lets people get on with their lives, look after their families and grow their businesses without having to worry about damp and draughts damaging their children’s health or a sudden hike in rent ending their dreams.Ensuring this means building up our nation’s offer of social homes. This has been ignored for too many decades. If our policies simply continue to provide only unaffordable housing, the people will never forgive us.However,we are the party that finally delivers the social and other high-quality affordable housing this country needs, they will never forget us.We need the money to build and renovate our available stock, and reform of the planning and laws around land to make it easier to get the social homes built.We believe this year’s Budget is the chance to signal that we will be serious about making this happen.Yours sincerely, DavidOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s been under Aprican rule ever since.”Immediate consequences seem to be a dramatic improvement in the weather, everyone in London is now dressed like Graham Norton and there’s a ban on black people and white people holding hands on buses.Love can breach the racial ide, though. Callum, a white nought, played by Jack Rowan, has fallen for Masali Baduza’s Sephy, the black daughter of the Home Secretary.This all plays well, obviously, to the self-loathing Empire guilt of the BBC and a lot of middle-class newspapers, who’ve described it as “timely”, “vital” and even claimed: “Noughts + Crosses’ world is our world.”I don’t know what part of Britain they live in where black and white people are banned from holding hands on buses but, lets set aside the show’s political agenda for a moment.The thing about Noughts + Crosses is that, for both technical and artistic reasons, it doesn’t work particularly well as a drama.The story is, of course, as solid as the day William Shakespeare wrote Romeo  Juliet, but the visual problems start with the fact that, because it was filmed in Cape Town, there appears to be a dirty great mountain hovering above what I think is meant to be Tilbury.The obvious climate issue also means poor Helen Baxendale, who plays Callum’s servant mum Maggie, is left with the gear change when she suddenly has to hold up her boss’s dress and say: “Beautul isn’t it . . . and so is the weather.”“Yes, finally some sunshine, You might even catch some colour.”Ker-unch. I’m also not buying the central relationship between Sephy and Callum, which is marked by a distinct lack of sexual chemistry, or the idea he qualied for the elite military school after one weekend on an assault course.The real issue you cannot ignore, however, is the political baggage. If Noughts + Crosses had been screened  or even  years ago, it would’ve been sensational.In , though, TV is overwhelmed by shows and voices telling us everything is racist and sexist, so it just felt and looked like the slowest-moving episode of Doctor Who ever.I find it particularly galling that a lot of those siren voices belong to journalists who I know will be out of a job the day they stop pretending modern-day Britain is really no dferent from Third Reich Germany in .It shouldn’t blind us to our own country’s faults, though.I can, for instance, think of a very prominent British institution that’s had nothing but white, male Director Generals since it was created in .The BBC, though, has always been better at pointing the finger at others rather than itself.So until such time as TV realises less is more, I fully expect Noughts + Crosses to be given awards, acclaim and further series, while a great chunk of television’s weary audience shrugs: “Yeah, everything is racist. We know.”THE heart now sinks every time the lt doors open at The Sex Clinic, on E, and out pops another human horror story like “fabulous fairy” Hugo.His description, not mine. And based on what  I’ve absolutely no idea.But apparently Hugo can have anything up to “three or four men a day”, while he describes his sex le as “very fast-forward”.So I took the hint and skipped through his bits at x speed.The trouble with The Sex Clinic, though, is there’s no light at the end of the tunnel – just more patients like free-wheeling Esther, from Wigan, who shocked me to the core by announcing: “I do not want to jump from d**k to d**k like Tarzan.”’Cos I’d no idea Tarzan was even gay.Although it’s Jane I actually feel sorry for, obviously.Beth England: “Getting on flights brought me back down to earth.”GOOD Morning Britain “megafauna” Piers Morgan: “A lot of people say I look like a young Roger Moore.”BBC continuity: “Now you’re in for a treat.

Or fully grown adults wearing replica football shirts  Or better still, bottled water — the real environmental scandal of our time.But cigarettes aside, Rishi Sunak’s first Budget as Chancellor ticked all the right boxes.In parts, quite a lot of parts, it sounded like a moderate Labour Budget.By which I don’t mean the kind of thing the wretched John McDonnell might have delivered — free unicorns for the poor and all people who earn money to be shot etc.I mean the Labour Party when it had an ounce of common sense.There was good populist stuff in there, especially the pledge to mend the potholes.I can’t be the only bloke who has had to fork out for a new tyre because of a hole in the road the size of the Isle of Wight.A lot of the Budget was, reasonably enough, directed at battling coronavirus.Help for businesses and sick pay for those who miss work and wouldn’t normally get it. And pretty much a blank cheque for the NHS.All of this was necessary, but it meant that much of the good stuff in the Budget got overlooked a little.This Government was brought to power by the votes of former Labour supporters in the North andthe North East.Parts of the country which, in the past, Conservative governments have left to rot.It took a lot to get those people to vote Tory — and they won’t do it againthere isn’t substantial investment in infra-structure for our northern towns and cities.The Chancellor addressed this. He announced a massive increase in capital spending.Some £billion will be spent investing in infrastructure.That’s the highest level in real terms since Clement Attlee’s excellent Labour government  years ago.We don’t know where it’s all going yet.If it gets swallowed up by the largely daft HS rail scheme, that will be a mistake.Sunak, though, knows the North East. He knows we need big investment to make these places attractive to business and to those who might move there.He knows too that we need to disperse high-paying jobs to the regions.So there’s going to be a new economic campus in the North and , civil service jobs moved from the capital to the regions.Excellent. This is what Boris Johnson means by “levelling up”.For too long London and the rest of the UK have been effectively two separate countries.So, the cigarettes apart, this was a fine Budget which should reassure those new Conservative voters that this government WILL look after their interests.And the latest opinion polls  Tories on  per cent.Labour way down on even its pathetic election share.So far, Boris and Rishi have not put a foot wrong.But here in the North we’re still watching, gentle-men. And hoping this is just a start.Fiddling with the constitution to ensure that he can remain president until . . . .That means he will have been president of his country longer than that chap he quite admires, Joseph Stalin.And will be  years old when he finally stands down.If he does stand down then.Unless it was with a qualying clause such as “hasn’t got very much”.The poor bloke has presided over a string of botched initiatives as a minister.I wouldn’t wish to be rude, but my suspicion is that a plaster garden ornament – a gnome with a fishing pole, or a heron – would do the job better.The hoarding of non-perishable food items, such as crates of Jack Daniel’s and tinned pies. You can’t be too careful.I suppose I also understand people buying hand sanitiser – asit had suddenly occurred to them that having clean hands might be a good idea.But what’s with the toilet paper  Is that really your first thought at a time of crisis  And the amount of the stuff people are buying!Lordy,that’s how many rolls they need, I think Covid- is the least of their worries.It’ll be the same when Armageddon comes, when the nukes are flying hither and thither.All the supermarkets will be stripped of vanilla-scented soft ply.“If I’m going to meet my maker, I will do so with a very clean arse.”They usually keep a bucket, or something, of the stuff outside the front door. It’s blessed by the monks, I think.Anyway they’ve discontinued the practice for a while to prevent the spread of this singularly annoying virus.And people are saying – well,it’s holy, it can’t possibly be tainted with flu virus, can it There’s one born every minute, isn’t there THE Labour Party is continuing its long and exciting journey from being a government in waiting to being a small organisation for the terminally deranged.Their latest act has been to suspend the last remaining sane member of the party, the excellent Trevor Phillips.He’s a lelong campaigner against racism – but has been suspended for being Islamophobic.He has never been remotely Islamophobic.If Phillips had been leading the Labour Party at the last election, we’d probably have a Labour government now.Instead, it was led by a rabble of anti-Semitic, far-left loons obsessed with identity politics and Palestine.I’M still not sure we’re doing the proper coronavirus checks on people flying back from their bloody skiing holidays in Italy.There are reports of many passengers receiving no checks at all.Surely anyone who has been to Italy should have been advised long ago to self-isolate – and inform the authoritiesthey feel poorly.I think we will regret not having done this.Well done British Airways for cancelling all flights to Italy.

Our economy, firms and workers need a short-term bailout to survive it.Brexit may entail another brief rocky patch which needs further stimulus.And the Tories also have to fulfil on their long-term mission, Boris Johnson’s revolutionary aim to spread ­London’s opportunities out to the regions.All that — “security today, prosperity tomorrow”, Mr Sunak called it — will cost hundreds of billions which, without raising taxes yet further, he must borrow.But there has never been a better time, with interest rates rooted to the floor.And we would trust a Tory Chancellor to do so more than any hard-left Labour regime hostile to capitalism itself.Britain seems to agree. The re-elected Tories are at  per cent in polls — but most of their voters do want far more spent on our threadbare public services.There were several standout ideas as Mr Sunak delivered his first Budget with remarkable poise and passion for a man less than a month into his job.The £billion to mitigate the Covid- pandemic should be an immense relief to small firms and workers, especially the year-long rates holiday and newly relaxed sick pay rules.And whatever the NHS needs it will get, the Chancellor said, starting with a £billion emergency fund.“It will be tough, but we will recover,” he added.It was stark, but reassuring.Then came tax cuts and freezes galore, music to the ears of working people.A National Insurance threshold rise worth £, the tampon tax axed, duties frozen on booze and fuel, a ­victory for The Sun.The planned infrastructure spend is vast: £billion over five years including £billion on roads, new rail ­stations, £billion on affordable social housing and £billion to remove Grenfell-style cladding from all high-rises.New roads and cheaper petrol won’t please eco campaigners, but there was also major investment in electric vehicle grants and charging, a plastic packaging tax and a big tree-planting programme.Labour might have had the wit to respond by saying Mr Sunak had simply stolen their clothes. Instead Corbyn droned idiotically on about austerity as his backbenchers prayed for the end.We wonder what ground his successor can fight on, with the Tories launching the biggest spending spree in  years.Yes, there is a risk it will end in tears.

The Tory finance chief turned the spending taps to ‘gushing’ as he laid out what experts called the biggest giveaway Budget since . There are some restrictions on entrepreneurs and a tax hike on EU nationals.But mostly it’ll be funded by an explosion in borrowing - the exact thing the Tories slammed Labour for doing during the  financial crisis.With all those big picture measures, and the fear of the COVID- virus, it’s easy to miss the small print of the -page Budget document and how it will hit you. So as a public service we’ve gone through it with a fine-toothed comb - and picked out an awkward  things the Chancellor may well prefer you not to read. This first one is actually not from the government - it’s from their budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsiiblity. “Historically, the chance of the economy falling into recession at some point in a five-year period is roughly one-in-two,” they say. “But a recession this year is quite possiblethe spread of coronavirus causes widespread economic disruption.”  Unions sounded the alarm after the Budget was used to launch a review of the Retail Prices Indexmeasure of inflation. The government claims RPI has “shortcomings” in how it’s measured and has proposed aligning it with the lower CPIH rate after February . But the higher RPI is used to calculate many people’s pension payments and pay uprating, according to the GMB union. So removing it will mean a hit to future payments. GMB general secretary Tim Roache warned: “These proposals will be a hammer blow for millions of working people and pensioners. This might be presented as a technical issue butthis goes through it will end up costing millions of workers and pensioners their full, hard-earned compensation. . Millions of EU nationals will be whacked with a £ NHS charge - raking in £.billion  The Budget confirms the Immigration Health Surcharge for non-Brits using the NHS will explode from £ to £ per year. And crucially it will be extended to more than million EU nationals who live in the UK from  - even those who work in the NHS or pay taxes in this country. We knew this would happen from the Tory manesto. What’s new, however, is the sheer size of the tax grab from EU nationals. Overall the Treasury is planning to cream off £.bn in extra Immigration Health Surcharge over five years, from   to  . There will be a discounted rate for children, but it’ll still be £ per year. . Universal Credit may only be fully rolled out in   Again, this is from the OBR watchdog and not the government. But it’s important.Last month, the government admitted it had pushed back the rollout of Universal Credit again and it would only end in September .Yet it’s been delayed more than seven times. And now there have been so many delays, the OBR has decided to just assume it will only finish in September . “Our decision to erge more materially from DWP’s plans reflects both the accumulated experience of the past seven years,” the OBR said drily. “And the greater emphasis on taking things slowly to protect claimants.” . The poorest people will gain less than middle earners  A little-noticed ‘distributional analysis’ in the Budgetshows the poorest % of households will gain between £ and £ per year. But while nothing like the bad old austerity days, that’s still less than the benefit to nearly everyone . Only the top % are benefiting less. The analysis, produced by the Treasury, shows the impact of tax and benefit changes in   from both the  Spending Round and the  Budget. . Vulnerable families will face a £ ‘Boiler Tax’  Blink and you’d miss it, but the Chancellor briefly said “from April  I’m freezing the levy on electricity and raising it on gas.” Raising it on gas, eh  So what does that mean  The small print shows he was talking about a consultation on a Green Gas Levy, a tax on gas suppliers in order to fund the production of bio-methane. Treasury officials told The Times it would cost £ per household per year initially, rising to £ per year by . But the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health warned it was deeply worrying. Chief executive Anne Godfrey said: By freezing electricity costs and increasing the cost of gas, the Chancellor is effectively making energy more expensive for everyone. The plan to increase the levy on gas is deeply worrying and we urge the Government to clary their intentions and outline how they will support those living in fuel poverty. . There’s a massive percentage tax rise on rolling tobacco  Given how bad they are for us - and the NHS - you’d expect cigarettes to see a tax hike. But the duty on roll-ups, used by some of the most skint smokers, is rising by far more than that on ordinary cigarettes. For most tobacco products it’s RPI inflation plus % for hand-rolling tobacco it’s RPI plus %. . Tories have handed a £.bn tax break to £, earners  A reeeeeeally complicated pensions change will help the NHS - but at the cost of giving £, earners a tax break. Basically, doctors had warned they were refusing overtime shts because they were being pushed over into a dferent set of pension rules. The current system meanspeople earn £ over a £k threshold, they are classed under a completely new set of rules for calculating their income to decide what tax relief theyaposll get on their pension. The rules are pretty simplepeople are definitely in one system or the other. But because doctors’ average salary is £k they didn’t know which system they were in. Treasury officials were looking at raising the £, threshold to £,. Now they’ve gone even further and raised it to £, from next month. But the relief will apply to everyone, not just doctors. And the small print shows it will deprive the Treasury of £.bn over five years. . There’s no mention of where tampon tax funding will go  Since  the money raised by the hated % VAT charge on tampons and sanitary towels, which couldnapost be abolished while the UK was in the EU, has been used to fund a charity pot for womenaposs groups. Since its creation, £million has been awarded by the fund to projects that help disadvantaged and vulnerable women across the UK. But now the Budget makes no mention of where that money will go. Women’s Budget Group Director Mary-Ann Stephenson said: “We welcome the removal of the tampon tax, but the Chancellor said nothing about what would replace it as a source of funding for violence against women and girls services, which it is estimated need £ million a year.” . Brexit is taking a massive hit to the British economy  Boris Johnson ’s Brexit will slow down economic growth to the tune of £, for every person in the country, the government’s spending watchdog has said.Brexit appeared just twice in Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s first Budget speech despite the huge impact it’s predicted to have on the national finances. The Office for Budget Responsibilitysaid based on current Brexit plans, growth would be slowed by around % in the long run. They said part of the slowdown was a result of lower migration - but most was from a slump in business investment. The body - set up by George Osborne to scrutinise Budgets - said the economy had only seen a third of the impact of Brexit so far. Another third will happen over the next five years, and the remainder after . And... The Tories’ new immigration system will hurt economic growth The OBR watchdog also warns the Tories’ Brexit immigration system will take a hit to GDP.

The rookie Chancellor delivered his first financial statement yesterday, announcing a £billion giveaway - with £billion targeted at easing the crisis triggered by the coronavirus. Supporters said it finally marked the end of decade-long austerity. But the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies today warned the multibillion pound injection was not all it seemed because so many Whitehall departmentsapos pots of cash were ring-fenced. Earlier, the Resolution Foundation think tanks said every household will suffer a £ annual blow due to the slump in the economic growth forecast - even before the impact of the coronavirus is factored in. It said the GDP markdown from the Office for Budget Responsibility financial watchdog was both incredibly grim and yet still unbelievably optimistic. Chief executive Torsten Bell said: In reality, once we take the economic impact of coronavirus into account, this is the weakest official growth outlook on record. And having finally ed to peak pay this year, real wage growth is set to weaken every year of the forecast period. So what did the IFS spot in the Budget that the Tories might not want you to know  Here are  things you should know. . National Insurance changes will mainly help higher earners  We knew this already - but the IFS has shown just how stark it is. A big Budget announcement was to scrap national insurance contributions on the first £, of your earnings - up from £, at the moment. It works out as a saving of up to £ a year per person, costing the government £.billion a year. But the IFS says only % of the gains will go to the poorest fth of households. Thataposs because many of them already earn under the threshold. . Brexit makes the spending look bigger than it is  The current spending plans are nothing like as generous as they appear, the IFS warned. Thataposs because the Budget counts the money no longer paid into EU coffers as a gain - despite the fact some of that money used to come back to Britain. IFS expert Ben Zaranko explained: Approximately £bn or £bn of that spending in   wonapost in fact be new money for departments to spend on the usual set of public services. It will in fact be replacing spending that used to be done by the EU. So including it will overstate somewhat the generosity. The IFS said average annual increases of .% sound substantial. But much of it is concentrated in health, schools, defence and overseas aid, with relatively little for other departments. . And weaposre still not back to where we were in   The Tories have ramped up spending on the state, with money plunged back into key departments. But because there were so many years of cuts, the amount spent per-person for public serviceswill “remain well below - levels in -. IFS expert Ben Zaranko explained: There are a broad set of departments that will have spending nowhere near where they were in . If you told them in  thataposs where spending would be, it would be quite remarkable to see a period of such sustained spending constraint. . A lot of it is short term  The plans also “look suspiciously front-loaded” to the first two years of the five-year Parliament, he added. “Spending increases pencilled in for the next two years are much bigger than what follows,” warned Mr Johnson. “This could suggest top-ups in later Budgets and hence a need for more tax or borrowing.” . A coronavirus recession could trigger disaster The respected think tank also raised fears about spiralling debt to fund the giveaway, amid low growth predictions, uncertainty over an EU trade deal and the global economic turmoil unleashed by the coronavirus. Mr Johnson said: “Underlying debt is forecast to rise slightly relative to national income.“If growth turns out less positive than expected as a result of coronavirus, Brexit or any other reason, then debt could easily start moving decisively upwards.”"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus delay new stage virus","story":"NewsUK officially enters coronavirus delay phase as Scotland bans mass gatheringsBritain has now moved into the second phase of dealing with the COVID- virus following an emergency COBRA meeting led by Boris Johnson.

Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the change following a COBRA meeting chaired by Boris Johnson - and revealed mass gatherings will be cancelled in Scotland from next week. Moving into the aposdelayapos phase means the UK is now on its second of four phases to deal with the virus. It means officials may soon give up on tracing each patientaposs contact and instead focus on social distancing. The objective is to slow down the spread of coronavirus and reduce numbers infected at the peak after the number of UK cases soared by  to  today. Ten people in the UK have now died from COVID-. The latest deaths were of an -year-old at Charing Cross Hospital in London and a woman in her sixties at Queenaposs Hospital in Romford. Both had underlying health conditions. From Friday, anyone with symptoms indicative of the virusshould self-isolate for seven days, Ms Sturgeon announced after the meeting of the emergency committee. Ms Sturgeon said another key focus will be to protect groups in society who are more at risk. The decision has been taken that we have now moved from a contain phase, into the delay phase, she said in a press conference. This would mean the introduction of social distancing measures such as restricting public gatherings and issuing more widespread advice to stay at home. There is also expected to be more specic preventative advice for the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Speaking moments before a Downing Street briefing from the Prime Minister and Chief Medical Officer, Scotlandaposs First Minister said: The objective is to seek to slow down the spread of the virus, to reduce the numbers... infected at any one time.  That is clearly important in trying to alleviate the pressure that is placed at any one time on our NHS. She added it would protect groups that are more at risk of serious complications. The vast majority of people who get this infection will suffer mild symptoms, she added. Ms Sturgeon said mass gatherings in Scotland will be cancelled from next week. She said: “We have looked carefully at the situation and come to the decision today in the Scottish government that we will, from the start of next week, advise the cancellation of mass gatherings of over  people that have the potential to have an impact on our frontline emergency services. “I should stay at this stage I am articulating a Scottish government position, not a UK-wide position.”  She stressed the move is not because of the risk of the virus spreading - which is not “signicantly” higher in large events. Instead she said she took the decision because of the “considerable” pressure on public services - and because it was important for public messaging about staying at home to be “consistent”. The sht in British policy came as Donald Trump dramatically escalated the US response to the coronavirus pandemic despite having previously played down the outbreak. The US President slapped a -day travel ban on continental Europe - excluding the UK and Ireland - even though there is effectively free movement across the continent. Mr Trump made the announcement in an Oval Office address to the nation, blaming the European Union for not acting quickly enough to address the spread of the virus and saying US clusters were seeded by European travellers. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has also today announced the country would go into lockdown as of pm - with schools, universities and public offices closing. Dr Varadkar: We have not witnessed a pandemic of this nature in living memory and this is uncharted territory for us.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak played down the prospect of the UK imposing similar travel restrictions, but acknowledged the US decision could have a knock-on effect on the British economy. The Cobra meeting comes after ten people with Covid- were confirmed to have died in the UK, while the total number of positive cases rose to . A Cabinet minister, who has not been named, was self-isolating while awaiting a test result after coming into contact with health minister Nadine Dorries. Several other MPs were understood to be staying at home prompting alarm at Westminster, although ministers said Parliament would stay open. The FTSE  index of leading London-listed companies fell more than % in early trading following the World Health Organisationaposs declaration of a pandemic. Experts have warned that closing schools could increase the risks for elderly grandparents and reduce the number of NHS workers available for the frontline fight against the disease.Keith Neal, emeritus professor of the epidemiology of infectious diseases at the University of Nottingham, said it was still too early to say whether steps taken in Ireland were a sensible precaution or an overreaction for the current stage of the epidemic. He added: Dferent countries are at dferent stages of the epidemic so what one country should do will not apply to others, we need to be guided by the local epidemiology and the science. This is why currently the UK has not followed these measures. Schools will close soon for the Easter holidays which will give some idea of the impact of this measure. Parents have already planned for childcare during these weeks. Closing schools has a number of known consequences. It might make the epidemic or ability to manage the consequences worse. He said closing schools could  lead  to a reduction in the health and social care workforce as people have to look after children.

Director-general Lord Tony Hall said it was “conceivable” a nonagenarian could be prosecuted for dodging the fee, when curbs are imposed from June. He was asked by the Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committeehe “was really prepared to take - or -year-olds to court” for non-payment. He said: “I don’t want to see people going to court, of course I don’t. “It’s conceivable but we don’t want that. We absolutely don’t want to get there.” MP John Nicolson told him: “Imagine the reputational damage.  “The distress caused to these old people... You’d be in the bizarre position of sending out your news teams to cover -year-olds potentially up in court for non-payment of the TV licence because of a system you, Lord Hall, signed up for.” BBC policy director Clare Sumner said it was “highly unlikely” nonagenarians would be hauled before magistrates, adding: “We are doing everything to help support people to pay.” The corporation is under huge pressure for planning to restrict the over-s’ benefit to only those who receive Pension Credit after it takes over responsibility. Boris Johnson has urged the corporation to “cough up” and preserve the leline - despite the Tories breaking a  election manesto to maintain free licences.But MPs heard the BBC and Government have held no talks about reversing the decision. The Mirror has spearheaded the campaign to save the benefit, with up to . million pensioners forced to pay £. from June.  Quizzed by the committeeany “meaningful” conversations had taken place with the Government about saving the benefit, Lord Hall admitted: “No, there haven’t been any conversations.” Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams, at said: “In just over two months’ time, millions of very old people are set to lose their free TV licence, leaving a sizeable minority on low incomes with the possibility of having to forego the pleasure and companionship they get from watching TV. “It’s absolutely true that the majority of older people are model citizens who wouldn’t dream of breaking the law, but the fact remains thatyou’re an older person living on a low income and simply cannot afford this new extra bill of £. then tough choices are likely to lie ahead. “Older people should never have been put in this position in the first place.  “Now more than ever, the Government and the BBC must sit down and broker a deal to agree a solution for all over-s that preserves their free licences.” Bectu broadcasting union boss Philippa Childs said: “There is absolutely no evidence that over-s will find themselves in court for not paying their TV licence fees, andthey do the blame rests squarely with the Government who have decided to discontinue a universal benefit that they had promised to keep.” Meanwhile, Committee chairman Julian Knight pointed to ongoing tensions between the BBC and Downing Street, warning channel chiefs: “You’re in a fight to the death with certain elements in No.” "},{"url":null,"title":"voice mirror chancellors budget finally","story":"NewsopinionVoice of the Mirror: Chancellors budget finally recognises Torys woeful failingsRishi Sunak, in the governments first Budget since the UK left the European Union, admitted the austerity caused by the Conservative Party has had a signicant impact on BritainShareCommentsByVoice of the Mirror:,  MAR Newsopinionthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news politics video budget--round-up-heres-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news politics  , theme : #

The Chancellor’s decision to splash the cash was forced in part by the coronavirus crisis.Yet his spree was also an acknowledgement Labour was right to argue you need investment to stimulate growth and protect jobs. We withhold judgement on whether his package of measures to help Britain weather the Covid- threat is sufficient. While support for staff and small firms is welcome there was not nearly enough to help the self-employed and gig economy workers.  It was also troubling that the Chancellor had nothing to say on social care, childcare or the funding crisis in local government.The extra investment in the NHS and further education was long overdue, as was the money to remove cladding from high-rise buildings. So many measures announced yesterday should and could have come years earlier. The Chancellor spoke of levelling up yet this remained a fundamentally Tory Budget in many respects. Even the Treasury’s own analysis showed the losers were the poorest %.  Mr Sunak has to deliver on his ambitious plans. Voters have heard talk of getting things done – now they want to see action that will improve communities, hospitals and schools. To listen to the Chancellor, you would not believe his party had been in power since . For all his emphasis on this being a Budget by a new government at the start of the new decade, he cannot wash his hands of responsibility for what happened in the past  years.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailA British doctor has become an unlikely YouTube star as the coronavirus grips the world. Dr John Campbell has been praised for his down to earth and intelligent daily advice videos which have racked up an incredible  million views.He has also amassed almost half a million subscribers to his channel Campbellteaching .His most viewed video to date was the first informational video he recorded about the coronavirus which has had K views. His second most viewed video on how to protect yourself and your family from COVID- has had K hits. Dr Campbell, who is a retired Nurse Teacher and A and E nurse, said that he created the videos to help people and stop them getting sick.  The -year-old said: I want to promote the health of my countrymen. Thataposs what we trying to do. Itaposs not about me. Itaposs about preventing the spread of the disease. He added: It has been quite a phenomenon. I started doing research into the virus in January. I read some papers from Chinese researchers and looked at the way the World Health Organisation was saying. I thought this was a bit strange. I looked at the way it was spreading and thought this could become a pretty large scale thing. I thought weaposve got a problem here. By early February I thought it could be a potential pandemic and people didnapost seem to be aware of this. Governments and official bodies didnapost seem to be very proactive about it so I made videos to get people to get thinking about it.  Iaposm surprised it has become so popular but clearly there is a thirst for information.  A lot of the information out there is dficult to understand so I make the videos so that the interested non-professional can take in the information. All through this the WHO and Government seem to have been reacting rather than carrying out proactive measures.   To control it we need quite dramatic Public Health interventions. Dad-of-two Dr Campbell records the videos in his little studio in a back room of his home in Carlisle.  Itaposs not very hi-tech, he says. I have an overhead camera and a HD webcam and it all goes into the same box that my son fitted up that, I believe, is used for gaming. I make some notes and work from them and explain the backgroud principles and use drawings to help illustrate things. Itaposs almost like being in the classroom. His approach to educating people around the world about COVID- in the simplest of ways has won him praise and even a suggestion the X Men star Sir Patrick Stewart should play him in a movie about the outbreak.  NursesOutlander urged others to watch his videos saying: For any of u wanting the best in health education  daily Covid- virus updates please visit Dr John Campbell’s YouTube channel. He’s a British nurse educator. He has a Doctorate in nursing. He’s an intelligent, Down to earth, common sense, fact based, articulate gentlemen. @ravaniaputri said: Dr. John Campbell, from the biology bible to a number of covid- videos on youtube. He has dedicated his le to educating others, you have my respect sir. @ScrougeOut said: LOL, I AGREE!! Dr. John Campbell is a daily youtube watch for me. Awesome factual info is put out by him!! JohnnyCovid said that Dr Campbell should be featured in any coronavirus movie tweeting: Patrick Stewart should play Dr. John Campbell for the upcoming #Coronavirus Movie.

Paranoid schizophrenic Odessa Carey, , was too unwell to enter a plea to a murder charge but following a trial of the facts, a jury found her guilty of killing her mother. She hit her mum on the head with a mallet until she died before decapitating her and removing her brain. Newcastle Crown Court was told that the headless body of her -year-old mother, also called Odessa, was found at the pensioneraposs home on her bed in Ashington, Northumberland, last April. The daughter was arrested after police found her hiding in the loft of a dferent house in Guide Post. Her motheraposs head was found under a sink by a police officer. During the trial, Nicholas Lumley QC, prosecuting, said that the day before she was arrested, the daughter had visited the allotment of a friend of her late father and she had blood on her hands and arms when she turned up. Mr Lumley said: She had with her a bag, the contents of which she showed to the allotment holder. It was a human head. She kissed it. It can only have been her motheraposs head. Mr Lumley said the allotment holder did not have a phone and did not contact police, but went to the pub and told someone what he had seen. Someone  he had told contacted police the next day, and the daughter was tracked down and arrested. After the jurors ed their findings, Judge Paul Sloan told them: The evidence which I heard before you were emled confirms that the defendant is acutely psychotic.  It is likely that a diagnosis is one of schizophrenia. She suffers from paranoid delusional beliefs. She doesnapost believe the body to be that of her mother. She is acutely unwell, so far all attempts to treat her have not been successful. The judge said he will dispose of the case on Thursday when the defendant, who is being treated at Rampton Hospital in Nottinghamshire, will be sentenced under the Mental Health Act. The judge said: The finding that you have ed does not lead to punishment, that would not be appropriate. What is appropriate is measures are put in place to continue efforts to treat her and also have measures in place to ensure public protection.  It can now be reported that at a magistratesapos court hearing, Carey answered the murder charge by saying: Not my mam, someone . At the end of that hearing, she asked the magistrate: Could it be investigated that my mam disappeared four years ago  Outside court, her family said: Our mam will be sadly missed by all - her sons, daughter, her brothers and sisters, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, nieces, nephews and friends. Sadly she was taken from us in a horric and vicious attack by our younger sister, who had suffered mental health issues for many years. Our mam was a loving, caring woman who would help anyone that needed it. She also loved to talk to anybody she met. She was taken from us too soon and had a lot more to give.  We believe that the mental health system failed us and vast improvements need to be made. It is too late for our mam and sister, but hopefully they will learn from our tragic loss and stop others from going through the same heartbreak. Our wounds will never heal, and we will miss our mam every single day.

It said thereaposs aposno evidence to suggest that pets can be carriers or can become ill from it themselvesapos, and urged people not to panic and not to abandon their pets.Animal welfare expert, Dr Samantha Gaines, offered her top tips for those who may have been affected by the outbreak.For those who have been advised to self-isolate, she said: The good news is that there are lots of ways to ensure your pet is well cared for evenyouaposre stuck at home. Dr Gaines said, when possible, you should arrange for another person to care for your pet, horse or livestock until you are able toto normal. Always wash your hands with soap and warm water after interacting with your pet. For those with dogs who are unable to leave the house, she advised that mental stimulation can keep your dog entertained and occupied until it is possible to take them for exercise again. This includes plenty of play, using food puzzles at tea time, teaching them a new trick or command, hiding treats around the house to search for, regular toilet breaks and even put on podcasts made especially for dogs.  If at any point you become worried about your petaposs health during self-isolation, ring the vet for advice but donapost visit the surgery in person. Those who havenapost been affected should still avoid being kissed or licked by their pet, sharing food, and adopting good hygiene after interacting with them, their toys or bedding.

The World Health Organisationdeclared a pandemic yesterday as Italy continued its dramatic lockdown and the United States imposed strict new travel limits. Experts have been eager to emphasise that many people will experience symptoms so mild they may not even know they have the virus, creating a challenge for everyone trying to stop its spread. Research emerged this week revealing coronavirus sufferers are likely to be able to infect others even when they have mild symptoms early on. Health Minister Nadine Dorries spoke of a aposvice-like painapos in her chest, a dry cough and a high temperature before she went into isolation and tested positive for the coronavirus. Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirrorGerman scientists tracked the course of the illness in nine people in Munich and found it could present as a common ‘cold-like’ illness at first. They found heavy loads of the virus in patientsapos noses and throats. They were found to be shedding the virus from those areas on the first day they were monitored when they only had very mild symptoms such as fatigue. The scientists found after day eight they could not grow viruses from throat swabs or sputum specimens taken from patients, suggesting the infection risk may decline by that point. Health authorities have described most of those who have died in the UK so far as having underlying health conditions.  Disturbing x-rays of the lungs of coronavirus patients who died after catching the virus in China show how the lungs become overwhelmed by fluid. Public health experts are warning Brits to watch out for mild symptoms to avoid spreading the illness to the most vulnerable in society, while scientists learn more about the virus in the attempt to halt it in its tracks. What do we know about coronavirus symptoms  Health authorities say many Brits concerned about respiratory symptoms during the winter flu season may have a cold or flu. The NHS coronavirus advice points out that the key theme to coronavirus symptoms including tiredness, a dry cough and high temperature are also associated with other respiratory illnesses.  However at this stage they suspect a dry cough and shortness of breath is more likely to point to Covid-, based on patterns in cases seen around the world. The WHO has outlined less typical symptoms of Covid- as including shortness of breath, aches and pains, nasal congestion, a sore throat , and diarrhoea, which are begin mild and gradually worsen. A report on ten cases of coronavirus in children in China found eight had temperatures, six had coughs, four had sore throats, three had blocked noses, and two had runny noses and sneezing. Public Health England has said while the medical community is still learning about Covid-: At the moment we believe that the majority of people who get the disease will experience a mild illness, but because this is a new virus we are not complacent and our scientists will continue to learn from evidence emerging.  At present, Public Health England and the NHS say the most common symptoms are a fever and dry cough. The NHS guidance says: Because itaposs a new illness, we do not know exactly how coronavirus spreads from person to person. Similar viruses are spread in cough droplets. Itaposs very unlikely it can be spread through things like packages or food.  The health authorities at this stage believe a runny nose and sneezing is more likely to point to a cold or flu than coronavirus, but they are not ruling anything out as they build understanding of the virus. A cough is being associated with coronavirus, but is also often present with seasonal influenza and sometimes colds. Professor Sian Grfiths, from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told the BBC last week the only way to tell for certain is to take the test. Asked how to tell the dference between Covid- and a cold or flu, she said: Through the test, unless your symptoms go on to develop into chest disease and then youaposre more likely to have coronavirus.  The symptoms tend to be fever, shortness of breath and a cough and a cold will probably have a runnier nose than that. But itaposs not foolproof and thataposs why the test is being done. There is a whole lot of testing being done through GPs and hospitals at the moment by Public Health England to seeweaposre missing any cases. Authorities are urging Brits to wash hands for  seconds, carrying hand sanitiser, avoiding touching your face, practising basic hygiene such as coughing and sneezing into a tissue or sleeve, and avoiding close contact with unwell people.  "},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus inside clinic volunteers paid","story":"NewsCoronavirus: Inside UK clinic where volunteers get paid up to £, to be infected in race to find vaccineEXCLUSIVE: Infecting volunteers so they can be tested could help stop the spread of Covid- - so now  triallists face  days of solitary confinement and we took a look insideShareCommentsByRhian Lubin:,  MAR Updated:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video how-long-can-coronavirus-live-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news coronavirus-inside-clinic-volunteers-paid-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters.

The red tape around the door makes it crystal clear that this is a high contamination zone. I am in Flucamp, where  human guinea pigs will be willingly infected with a strain of coronavirus in the coming months. The Mirror has gained exclusive access to the facility, which could play a vital role in the fight against Covid- by helping create a vaccine or anti-viral drugs. Triallists can earn between £,-£,. Tens of thousands of volunteers have already applied. “This is a critical step to fast-track development of these anti-virals and vaccines,” explains Dr Andrew Catchpole, chief scientist at Hvivo which runs the facility. “We’re trying to use our expertise in this area to see what we can do.” Volunteers will not be infected with Covid-, but with “harmless” strains of the coronavirus – OC and E – which will cause a very mild respiratory illness. The aim is to safely expose them to “close relatives” of the deadly strain, helping pharmaceutical firms test potential vaccines. Dr Catchpole added: “If it can work on our virus, there’s no reason why it can’t work with Covid-.” Cathal Friel, executive chairman of Hvivo’s owner Open Orphan, added: “The company is starting the process of developing the world’s first coronavirus challenge study model – basically, we take a harmless version of the virus that we can use and monitor. “This is a British company which is the world centre for virology.” Hvivo, which has been running clinical trials on flu and cold viruses since , has seen an unprecedented , apply for coronavirus tests at its site in Whitechapel, East London.  But the odds of being suitable are -. Only  to -year-olds are even considered and smokers are immediately ruled out. Dr Catchpole said: “We want very healthy iniduals so we can be sure that the disease that’s given is controlled. Then they come in and have a blood sample. We’re testing for pre-existing immunity. We’ve all been exposed to family members of the coronavirus, we’ve all got some levels of immunity. “We need to screen people so we’re only giving the virus to those who would get sick. That can eliminate up to % of subjects.”For those who clear that hurdle, lungand livertests follow. Dr Catchpole said: “If you get through, participants would be invited back in for quarantine.” A month before quarantine begins, half of the group will be given a potential Covid- vaccine – currently in development by a third party. The other % will get a placebo. One month later, all are infected with a “lesser” virus via a nasal spray before being confined to one of the ft by ft rooms, only half of which have windows, for  days.Staff in blue scrubs, gloves and ventilators will come in several times a day to take nasal swabs and other routine tests. Gruesomely, the amount of mucus produced by participants is weighed daily. Dr Catchpole explained: “When you have a cold you need to blow your nose, it’s an effective measure of the level of symptoms someone has. “So we provide them with pre-weighed tissues so we know the weight of the tissue at the start and they have a sealed bag which they put used tissues in.” Meals will be delivered on a tray by staff wearing ventilators and other protective gear. Access to TV, games consoles, wi-fi, and a few home comforts help ease the boredom of two weeks’ solitary confinement. Site manager Laura Krizman said: “They’re encouraged to bring laptops, books, students bring projects. Some brought teddy bears, cuddly things.” All personal belongings are decontaminated at the end of the trial. Surprisingly given all that, ex-triallists have left rave reviews on Flucamp’s website.

And those living in north London, Torbay, Devon and parts of Hampshire are feared to be most susceptible at the moment. These areas have had the most confirmed cases in the UK. Six people have died so far after being diagnosed with Covid- in the UK, reports Devon Live . However, coronavirus has now been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation. For updates on the coronavirus outbreak,  read our live blogPHEaposs useful tool shows that, of am on March , , there were  cases confirmed in the capital. A further  had been recorded in the southeast of England, and  people had been infected in the southwest. There had been some  cases recorded in the northwest of England. A further  were recorded across the Midlands. As a result, the NHS in England will ramp up testing facilities so , more coronavirus tests can be performed each day.  Professor Dame Sue Hill, NHS chief scientic officer, said: “The NHS is ramping up the number of testing centres across the country, to help people get care quickly or have their mind put at ease. “England’s NHS has world-leading expertise and every hospital across the country, and the healthcare professionals who run them, are now actively planning to respond flexibly to manage new demand. “The public can help us to help the country to stay safe by practising good hygiene and washing their hands more often, for at least  seconds.”  Now local hospital labs will join specialist services, including those already provided by PHE, in being able to accurately detect the presence of the new virus. Professor Sharon Peacock, director of the National Infection Service at Public Health England, added: “Wider testing is important as it allows us to continue to meet demand as the number of people being tested increases in the coming weeks. This will ensure that PHE and the NHS have the most robust system possible to understand what is happening with the virus.

Schools across the country were put on alert tonight that they might need to shut their doors for a fortnight, the Mirror can reveal. The nationwide coronavirus closures could come into effect on March  - weeks before the traditional Easter break. It would mean youngsters spending a month out of the classroom and create a childcare nightmare for working parents. Follow our coronavirus live blog for the latest updates Another plan being considered is shortening the Easter break by a week and scrapping the May half-term. But this would create havoc with families who have already booked trips away during the traditional holidays. Teachers have been told the ‘home-learning packs’ must be ready to send out by Friday. But sources said any enforced closure would almost certainly not take place until the end of next week. Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror The packs include coursework for GCSE and A-Level students and curriculum-based learning for younger children. Schools are also busy compiling lists of children who have access to the internet at home. The plan is for work to be set via online education s that pupils can log-on to remotely. Workers are also expected to go into schools during the shutdown to perform ‘deep cleans’.  One teacher said: “We have had guidance from our head of the academy who has been told to expect at least a week-long closure, possibly two. “If schools are closed from mid-March, it wouldn’t make sense to open them up again so close to Easter. We’re preparing for a month at home. “The home-learning packs have to be all ready by this Friday, with the aim of sending them home with the kids the following Friday.” Another teacher at a school in the north of England said they had been ordered to get emergency plans underway.

It is the first step towards being checked for Covid- - a new strain of coronavirus which emerged in China - but some Britons have complained that they have been forced to wait up to two weeks for a test.

Health chiefs expect the UK outbreak to begin peaking within a fortnight and there are fears that more than , people could end up catching the flu-like illness. In the delay phase - the second of four stages in the UKaposs action plan - schools could be closed, large gatherings could be banned and millions could be told to work from home to prevent the spread of the illness. Here is everything you need to know about how and where to get tested, how long you will wait for a result and how many people are being tested.

The symptoms of Covid- are similar to those of the flu and some are also displayed in people with a common cold. People who report symptoms or concerns after ing from countries with severe outbreaks, including Italy, Iran and parts of South Korea and China, will be tested. Those ing travellers should stay indoors and avoid contact with other people eventhey do not have symptoms. People can test positive eventhey arenapost displaying symptoms. There have been calls for testing to be expanded to others. How are people checked for coronavirus   Samples are swabbed from the back of the throat, nose and deeper respiratory tract and then sent for laboratory testing.

Medics have been using thermometer guns at some airports to check travellers for a fever, but doubts have been cast on the effectiveness of those tests. A recent study found that CT scans were effective at detecting Covid- in the early stages. Where are people being tested   People may be asked to go to an assessment poda hospital nearby has one. Some have been tested at home by medics wearing protective suits and masks. Drive-thru testing sites have popped up in places such as Wolverhampton, Edinburgh and Parsons Green in south-east London.

A hearing at Cleethorpes Town Hall on Tuesday, was told how on December , , the little boy and his father had been sleeping on one side of an L-shaped sofa. His mother, who had been struggling to sleep, was watching a film and got up at around am when she heard her other son wake. She told the inquest she had left her baby on top of an adult sized duvet, which was tucked under his arms. I went to check on my other son who woke during the night and was with him for about ten minutes, she said. When I ed he was asleep where I had left him, but I noticed that he looked quite pale and clammy. So I nudged his shoulder and he didnapost react and then I noticed some blood on his nose and that he wasnapost breathing. The inquest heard that the infant had suffered from a cough and a cold in the three days leading up to the tragedy and had been taken to the out-of-hours GP. But the doctor concluded that despite a virus, he was healthy and happy and had no signs of any injuries, and his parents took him back to his dadaposs parentsapos home where they had been staying for a few days. The babyaposs older brother, who was three, also had a cold at the time. When she found her son unresponsive, the mum quickly woke her partner, who was sleeping touching distance away from his son. They rang the emergency services before starting CPR. An ambulance arrived at the house within ten minutes and took the child to Grimsbyaposs Diana, Princess of Wales hospital. During the trip paramedics tried to resuscitate the baby boy numerous times, but were unsuccessful. Further efforts were made inside the hospital, but sadly the young baby could not be saved and was pronounced dead shortly after am. A post-mortem examination of the baby, which was carried out by Dr Cohen of Sheffield Childrenaposs Hospital, found that the baby had no toxins in its system and other than an inflamed throat, appeared to be a normal healthy baby boy. The doctor said that she concluded that the child had died from Sudden Infant Death. Dr Cohen said: Sudden Infant Death is the most common form of infant death in the developed world. There are a number of risk factors that can lead it to be more common, such as the age of the child and gender, with males babies dying  per cent more than females. A baby sleeping on its side can also increase these risks and sleeping under or on top of an adult duvet can cause a baby to overheat. There are ways to reduce these risk factors, with babies sleeping on their backs in a cot without a pillow, and they should never be placed next to a radiator. Acting coroner for North East Lincolnshire, Mark Kendall, ruled that that the baby died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome.

Lucas Dobson had been spending time with his father and friends near the River Stour at Sandwich in Kent when he got into trouble in the water on Saturday August  last year. He was playing with other children on the river bank when he fell into the water between a jetty and a moored boat, the inquest in Maidstone was told. His father, Nathan Dobson, told the hearing that he was working on one of a number of vessels by the river, while his friend James Fromage was cooking on a barbecue and another friend, Pete Snelson, was fishing nearby.  Lucas tried to climb on to one of the boats with other children who were playing. Fighting back tears, Mr Dobson told the inquest: I looked down for less than a minute, and then I heard a commotion. I stood up and saw the look on Jamesapos face, and he said it was Lucas. Before a blink of an eye they were in the water looking for him. I saw James and Pete get in the water and I looked which way the current was going and I went a few boats up to jump in the river.Mr Fromage, at whose riverside property the boats were moored, told the inquest he had seen Lucas attempt to climb between the jetty and a boat. He said: He went for the rail [of the boat] and lted his foot and missed the rail and dropped, straight in feet-first. I dropped the barbecue tongs and jumped down to try and grab him, but I could not get in the gap between the boat and the mooring. Recollecting the conditions in the river that afternoon, Mr Fromage told how the surprisingly strong current had carried Lucas away from the spot where he was last seen falling into the water.  None of those present when the accident took place, including Lucas, were wearing lejackets or other safety equipment, the hearing was told. Despite searching frantically for some time, the friends were unable to find Lucas and the emergency services were called. A massive search began for Lucase, who lived in Deal, Kent, involving hundreds of local residents who joined expert volunteers from Kent Search and Rescue. Two days after he disappeared, Lucasapos mum Kirsty Furze led hundreds of well-wishers on a candle-lit walk to the end of Deal pier.  The familyaposs plight prompted a wave of support from people in coastal communities and several vigils were held. The boyaposs body was found, four days after he disappeared, on Wednesday August , close to where he went missing. A post-mortem concluded the cause of death was immersion. Area Coroner Joanne Andrews delivered a verdict of accidental death. Following the hearing, a statement on behalf of Lucasaposs mother Kirsty was read by solicitor Neille Ryan.He said: Lucas Dobson was a beautul, popular vibrant six-year-old boy. He loved singing, dancing cars and bikes. His loss has had a devastating effect on the family, so much so that Lucasapos mother Kirsty could not face being here today.

Neil Richardson fumed: Unbelievable nonce like behaviour. Predator tendencies. And Sally Hurley said He has no right to use her details to make contact other than work related. He also clearly knew how old Katie is and although, yes legal, Katie is still a minor.  I wonder how many young ladies desperate for a job have been taken in by this vile excuse of a man. I do hope this is brought to the attention of head office, so itaposs dealt with properly.

With new cases of COVID- are being confirmed every day, the Government is taking steps to try to prevent more tragic deaths. People are being asked to stay indoors for  daysthey believe they could have the deadly illness, and there are a a lot of rules they must follow. While this is pretty straight forward for anyone who lives alone, it can be extremely dficult for families and people in shared houses. Weaposve had a look through exactly what self-isolatingyou live with other people involves. While the idea of all chilling in the living room together is appealing, government guidelines says you must all stay by yourself and canapost mix. Affected people must stay at home all the time. This means they canapost go to work or school. You should stay in a well-ventilated room with a window that can be opened. If you need food or other supplies, you canapost go out and get them and must ask family or friends to deliver them to you.  This normally involves staying in certain rooms of the house. If possible, the quarantined person should have their own bathroom which is not used by anyone  in the house. If you donapost have the facilities for this, they should always try to use the toilet last. The governmentaposs advice suggests setting up a bathroom rota for washing and bathing. If sharing a bathroom, the isolated person should clean it themselves after every use.  Towels should not be shared, and they should also have their own separate dishes, glasses and cutlery. Plates and cutlery should be washed in a dishwasherpossible. If you are living with somebody who is in self-quarantine, itaposs advised that you wash your hands regularly with soap and water for at least  seconds. This should also be done every time you come into contact with the person or touching something they have touched. Wear a facemaskadvised to do so If you have been given a mask, wear it whenever you are in the same room with other people - including doctors and other medical staff.  No visitors Only people who live with you are allowed into the house. All communication should be done over the phone or through other means of technology. If someone is dropping off supplies they should leave them outside. Waste Your rubbish should be double bagged and canapost be thrown away. The bags should be kept until the quarantine is over.

But how do you do thisyou have a young family  Explaining to a child that they canapost go outside and see their friends is always going to be tough, but luckily parenting expert Rachel Fitz-Desorgher, has shared some helpful advice.Rachel, expert speaker at  The Baby Show  and author of Your Baby Skin to Skin, toldthat routine and keeping the kids busy is essential.She said: Stick to a routine as far as possible. Children find routine very reassuring and calming, and most adults do too. So keep your getting-up, meal and bed times the same as normal and make sure that school work is still getting done.Make the most of having the children at home by involving them in the day to day running of the house - even nursery-age children are able to help with washing-up, dusting and laundry, so you don’t need to wear yourself out whilst they zone out in front of the TV. Itaposs also vital to explain whataposs going on in the right way, as you need them to know how  important it is without scaring them.Rachel says: Speak honestly about why you are at home and answer questions simply, briefly and plainly - going overboard on cheery reassurance can actually cause more alarm as, the more we try desperately to hide our underlying anxiety, the more children tend to sense it.If they say they are anxious, try simply saying, in a normal voice I understand that you’re feeling worried - it’s normal to find new things a bit scary.

Timothy Biswick, a University of Leicester research fellow who is looking at microplastic pollution in the oceans, said: She knows what sheaposs talking about in terms of climate change. She was talking about things in quite some detail, so you know that this person knows what they are talking about and are passionate about it.

During a bombardment of  aggressive texts Wood suggested to Miss Hall he would pay Child Support Agency payments for their daughtersshe had some sort of sexual contact with him. The -year-old also would became obstructive during weekend access visits, either being absent when he was supposed to collect his children or calling Miss Hall at the eleventh hour to say the visit was off. Police were called in after Miss Hall, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, found  missed calls from Wood on her phone. She told officers how her ex-partner who worked for an online retail firm threw temper tantrums during their seven-year on-off relationship and would smash furniture up and destroy her clothes. She had also received injuries as a result of him pushing her head into a mirror and he had been given been given a warning about his behaviour in .

His behaviour is not right or a good example to set for our girls. At Bolton Magistrates Court, Wood, from Westhoughton, admitted harassment without violence and was issued with a restraining order.  He was also ordered to complete a programme on Building Better Relationships plus  hours unpaid work. The court heard the pair met in  and began dating shortly afterwards but Miss Hall said Woodaposs behaviour deteriorated following the birth of their first child. Robin Lynch, prosecuting said: She confirms that a restraining order is wanted saying this has been a long process for her and she just wants the defendant to realise his behaviour towards her is not acceptable. She says it has affected her mental health, work-le and her daughteraposs lives. She does not wish the defendant to receive a custodial sentence and thinks that would actually be worse and affect the young daughters immenselythe defendant was to go to prison. She does want the defendant to have contact but not to contact her directly or indirectly save through a third party for child contact only and not to go onto her street. She has moved and initially thought the defendant didnapost know where she was living - she now realises he does know where she lives. During these proceedings he has only seen the children on one occasion and she doesnapost want to stop contact in any way.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailUntil the glorious day they welcome a fly-on-the-wall camera crew into their homes Kardashian style , the question remains - what exactly do the Royal family do all day  We see them out and about on public engagements every few weeks, but what do they do the rest of the time  Do they spend hours on the sofa in their PJs, eating cheese straight from the packet while binge-watching Netflix and Googling themselves  Or do they wile away the hours trying on their jewels, eating five-bird roasts and getting squfy  Sadly itaposs neither of these scenarios . As Meghan Markle and Prince Harry prepare for their new lives after quitting the Royal Family and stepping back from their duties, weaposve had a look at what EXACTLY they - and other members of the Firm - get up to every day. The Queen Despite being , the Queen has a very, very busy schedule. Typically sheaposs woken up at .am to bagpipe music . Then itaposs paperwork time. The Queen spends her days answering letters, doling out knighthoods, having meetings with her staff and meeting and greeting diplomats, bishops, judges and military top dogs .  Because sheaposs the Queen and has to be organised, she reportedly allocates  minutes to each and knows, instinctively, when those  minutes is up. In recent years the Monarch has started to hand some of her patronages down to younger members of the family, including Kate and Meghan, to lighten her load slightly. When her paperwork and meetings are done, itaposs thought she takes her dogs for a walk. In the early evening, she studies a report of the dayaposs parliamentary proceedings and on Wednesdays she has an audience with the Prime Minister.  Sheaposs also said to enjoy photography as a hobby, just like Harry and Kate. Prince Charles Like the Queen, Charles has to keep up to date with everything going on in the government so spends time each day going through official state papers. He also heads up  Princeaposs charities, including The Princeaposs Trust, The British Asian Trust and Business in the Community. So presumably all of these keep him busy.  A keen gardener, Charles has also authored two books on ecology: Harmony: A New Way of Looking At The World, and On the Future of Food. Not only that, but he also devotes time to another hobby of his, watercolour painting, though the reviews have not been kind. In his role as heir, Charles is in charge of the Duchy of Cornwall - a private estate established by Edward III in . It covers , hectares across the UK, including farms, residential areas, commercial buildings and quarries.  It provides a huge amount of revenue each year, which is used to fund the public, private and charitable work of Charles, William and Harry and their wives. As the boss, Charles is responsible for overseeing it all, with the help of a team of  employees. Camilla Camilla supports her husband Charles as he carries out his royal duties. She also carries out her own solo engagements, and has become patron or president of more than  organisations and charities since joining the royal family. Even when sheaposs not visiting the charities, Camilla will be keeping up to date with her work.  As well as being step-mum to William and Harry, the Duchess has two children of her own - Laura Lopes and Tom Parker Bowles - and grandchildren, who she spends a lot of time with. Prince William Since quitting his part-time job for the East Anglian air ambulance, Prince William has focused on parenting and royal commitments. In the past he has faced criticism for being work-shy, but he spoke about his readiness to take more on in an interview with the BBC.  He said: Iaposm a new father and I take my duties and my responsibilities to my family very seriously and I want to bring my children up as good people with the idea of service and duty to others as very important. Since moving back to London, William has taken on a number of royal responsibilities from his grandmother the Queen. In his spare time, William is into sports and enjoys skiing. The Duchess of Cambridge Kate is also a very hands on mum to George, Charlotte and Louis but she has a lot of royal duties and responsibilities. She recently spoke of her aposmum guiltapos , saying she feels bad whenever she leaves her trio at home to go to work. When Giovanna Fletcher asked hershe struggled with it, she said: Yes absolutely - and anyone who doesnapost as a mother is actually lying. Yep - all the time, Even this morning, coming to the nursery visit here - George and Charlotte were like aposMummy how could you possibly not be dropping us off as school this morning apos  Itaposs a constant challenge - you hear it time after time from mums, even mums who arenapost necessarily working and arenapost pulled in the directions of having to juggle work le and family le. Much of Kateaposs charity work is angled towards children, with her latest project being the  Big Questions survey. Eagle-eyed royal watchers have spotted her on the school run and taking the kids swimming at the pool in Buckingham Palace. In  she also teamed up with her husband and Prince Harry to launch Heads Together. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Until the end of last year, Meghan and Harryaposs day to day would have been fairly similar to Kate and Wills. They spent their time caring for son Archie and working with the patronages and charities. Harry is president, ambassador or patron of a number of organisations including African Parks, Rugby Football Union, Sentebale and Rhino Conservation Botswana.  He also set up and is now patron of the Invictus Games, a competitive event for wounded, injured or sick servicemen, women and veterans. Shortly after joining the Royal Family in , Meghan also took on a number of Patronages. Like her husband, she picked causes close to her heart including The Royal National Theatre, animal charity Mayhew and Smart Works, which helps women get back into work through fashion. But from April it will be all change, as the couple step back from their royal lives. They have said they will continue working with their existing charities, but will face geographical challenges as they will be based in Canada most of the time.  As they are no longer royal and plan to be financially independent, the couple will be free to earn their own cash - and experts believe they could earn millions . Even though theyaposve been banned from using the word aposRoyalapos in their branding, itaposs not likely to impact their earning potential because of their global reach and links to the rich and famous. Harry and Meghan are already developing links with investment banking giants as they plan to rake in millions. Last month it was reported that  billionaire business moguls are desperate to bring the couple to play a starring role  at the World Economic Forum in Davos next year. Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie The York sisters are the most senior royals who arenapost aposworking royalsapos, which means they have to go out and earn their own cash. Beatrice works in finance and consulting, and sheaposs currently the vice president of partnerships and strategy at software company Afiniti.  Referring to her as Beatrice York, the companyaposs website states: Beatrice is responsible for the management of the strategic Afiniti partnerships as well as company growth through unique initiatives and client development. Previous experience includes associate at Sandbridge capital a small consumer focused private equity firm. Business development associate at Sony pictures television. Beatrice began her career as a research analyst at a boutique private wealth firm. She received a degree in History and History of ideas from University of London, Goldsmiths College. Meanwhile Eugenie, who married Jack Brooksbank last year and lives at Kensington Palace, works as a director at London art gallery Hauser  Wirth. Both princesses are also involved with a number of charities and not-for-profit organisations they are passionate about. Beatrice will also be busy planning her royal wedding at the moment, which will take place on May . Zara and Mike Tindall Like their royal cousins, the Tindalls are also non-working royals which means they have to go out to work as well. Princess Anne made the decision not to give her kids royal titles, which means Zara had one of the more normal royal upbringings.  This also allowed her to have a career of her own as sheaposs not restricted by a HRH. Sheaposs a hugely successful equestrian and in  became the first member of the Royal Family to win an Olympic medal - taking the silver at the London games.

Compared to wartime guidance, the grim advice highlights the moral dilemmas for staff at hospitals which are unable to cope with so many patients and not enough workers, beds or equipment. Patients who have a limited number of le years left, eventhey could survive, should be left to die, they have been told. Do you have a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror. The elderly and people with pre-existing conditions are most at risk of dying. Italy and its million residents are under an unprecedented lockdown in a desperate bid to control Covid-, which has infected more than , people and killed . The guidelines published by Italyaposs College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Carewere drafted by medical doctors. They urge medics to guarantee that those patients with the highest chance of therapeutic success will retain access to intensive care, The Atlantic reported.According to the recommendations, it may become necessary to establish an age limit for access to intensive care. The guidelines state: “What might be a relatively short treatment course in healthier people could be longer and more resource-consuming in the case of older or more fragile patients.”  The advice applies to patients in intensive care for reasons other than Covid-. Overstretched doctors have spoken out about working on the front lines of the fight against the epidemic.Dr Christian Salaroli, from the badly-affected Lombardy region, told Il Corriere della Sera: If a person between  and  years old has serious breathing dficulties, it’s likely we will not proceed . If they have multi-organ failure, with more than two or three vital organs, it means that their mortality rate is  per cent. He added: “To say that you do not die from the coronavirus is a lie that fills me with bitterness.In a post that has been widely shared on Facebook, Dr Daniele Macchini, a doctor in Bergamo, likened the virus to a tsunami that has swept us all.He added: The situation is now nothing short of dramatic.

Declaring Covid- a apospandemicapos and expressing major concerns of the levels of aposinactionapos by governments across the globe, WHO chief Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus added that the tide can be turned on the deadly coronavirus. The WHO chief said several countries had shown it can be suppressed and controlled but questioned whether all had the resolve to do what was required. The doctor called on countries to take a whole-of-government, whole-of-society approach, built around a comprehensive strategy to prevent infections, save lives and minimize impact. He summarised it in four key areas:Prepare and be ready. Detect, protect and treat. Reduce transmission. Innovate and learn.Dr Ghebreyesus said: All countries must strike a fine balance between protecting health, minimizing economic  social disruption and respecting human rights. WHO’s mandate is public health. But we’re working with many partners across all sectors to mitigate the social and economic consequences of this Covid- pandemic. Every person in the world, and every sector of society, must join the fight against Covid-, said Dr Ghebreyesus. He described it as not not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector. He added: We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace, and mobilize their people in the response, those with a handful of Covid- cases can prevent those cases becoming clusters, and those clusters becoming community transmission. Sounding a final not of optimism, Dr Ghebreyesus said beating the deadly virus was doable. He said: I remind all countries that we are calling on you to ready your hospitals, and protect and train your healthworkers. Let’s all look out for each other.  There’s been so much attention on one word. Let me give you some other words that matter much more, and that are much more actionable: Prevention. Preparedness. Public health. Political leadership. And most of all, People. We’re in this together, to do the right things with calm and protect the citizens of the world. It’s doable. Meanwhile in the UK, health secretary Matt Hancock has been speaking in the House of Commons this evening. He said Parliament will be kept open.  Mr Hancock said: “This afternoon the World Health Organisation declared coronavirus a global pandemic. I’ve spoken to the leader of the House and we have had discussions Mr Speaker, and we have resolved that we will keep Parliament open. “Of course, in some ways this House may have todferently, but the ability to hold the Government to account and to legislate are as vital in a time of emergency as in normal times - our democracy is the foundation of our way of le.” He added that the Government will continue to work closely with Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, the Lord Speaker and the authorities in both Houses in the coming days and weeks. Mr Hancock added: “As the leader of the House said in business questions last week the public will expect Parliament to sit and to get on with its job. Our approach will be guided by the best scientic evidence and medical advice and we will take all necessary measures to deal with this outbreak.” "},{"url":null,"title":"ice wall only defence stopping","story":"NewsIce wall only defence stopping Fukushimas radioactive water seeping around the worldIn  a huge underwater earthquake triggered a massive tsunami in Japan, killing thousands and causing utter devastation - but there was a greater horror about to happenShareCommentsByJane LavenderAssistant Editor:,  MAR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video inside-fukushima-ghost-town-laid-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news world-news ice-wall-only-defence-stopping-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailNine years ago the world watched in horror as a massive underwater earthquake unleashed devastation on the coastal regions of Japan. Measuring at least  on the richter scale, the earthquake was the worst ever experienced in Japan and the fourth worst the world had seen since records began. It triggered a massive tsuami that battered Japanaposs coast with  foot waves, which travelled six miles inland and reached horrying speeds of mph. With less than  minutes warning before the devastating tsuami hit, people just minutes to grab what they could and flee for their lives. Thousands died. The official death toll stands at more than ,. The earthquake was so powerful it moved Japanaposs main island of Honshu eight feet east and even shted the earth on its access by up to  inches. Tens of thousands of buildings collapsed and anything in the tsunamiaposs path was decimated. But as the country surveyed the horror that had unfolded on March , , an even greater evil was about to hit. The earth had triggered a shutdown of the active reactors at the Fukushima Daini nuclear power plant in the north east of Japan. This caused the electricity supply to fail and the emergency generators to kick in as a fail safe. One of the crucial actions of the generators was to power the pumps that were ciruclating coolant through the cores of the reactors, which was critical to remove the heat, even after nuclear fission has stopped. However, the huge tsunami swamped the nuclear power plantaposs seawall and flooded the lower floors around several of the reactor buildings. Basements filled with seawater, which knocked out the emergency generators and shut off the power. The loss of the cooling agent to the core of the reactors led to three catastrophic nuclear meltdowns and three hydrogen explosions.In the days that followed, and as radiation continued to pour into the atmosphere, the Japanese government had to create an ever growing exclusion zone around the nuclear power plane.Around , people had to flee their homes and huge amounts of water contaminated with radioactive isotopes flooded into the Pacic Ocean.Almost immediately, the clean-up and decommissioning of the crippled nuclear plant began.An army of robots was sent into the site to remove debris, make safe the melted reactors and build a impenetrable wall around the damaged site. But there was still one critical problem - radioactive water was still leaking out of the plant underground, mingling with fresh water and heading out to sea to seep around the world. Owners at Fukushima came up with a truly innovative solution - a giant, underground ice wall. It freezes the ground solid and prevents the radioactive water flowing into the sea. Only a few feet of the giant pipes can now been seen above ground but the frozen wall reaches  feet underground. The massive wall encircles reactors one to four and cost a huge £million to build. To keep the contaminated water away from the fresh water outside the plant, the wall needs to remain minus C at all times. But while the wall was being constructed .million tonnes of contaminated water leaked out of the ruined reactors, which now all has to be safely stored so it cannot damage the surrounding supply. It has been estimated it will take up to  years decontaminate the affected areas and decommission the plant. Those who were living close to Fukushima are still dealing with aftermath of that terrible day. More than a third of children were found to have abnormalities with their thyroid glands, while  of them developed thyroid cancer.

An insider in neighbouring South Korea revealed to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper that the dictator was holed-up in Wonsan, a beach resort town. Intelligence analysis suggests that Kim Jong-un has been away from Pyongyang for a considerable time, the source said. This appears to be connected with the coronavirus outbreak.

Elizabeth Schneider caught COVID- at a house party hosted by her friend, but didnapost know how serious it was to begin with. Nobody at the small gathering was coughing or showing any signs of illness. But within three days,  per cent of the guests were sick - all suffering with symptoms associated with the virus including a high fever.Writing on Facebook , Elizabeth, from Seattle, said: The symptoms appear to be dferent depending on your constitution and or age.Most of my friends who got it were in their late s to early s. I’m in my mid s. For us it was headache, fever , severe body aches and joint pain, and severe fatigue. I had a fever that spiked the first night to  degrees and eventually came down to  and then low grade ..Some folks had diarrhea. I felt nauseous one day. Once the fever is gone some were left with nasal congestion, sore throat .Only a very few of us had a mild itchy cough. Very few had chest tightness or other respiratory symptoms.  The symptoms lasted between  and  days for the affected guests, but thankfully none of them were hospitalised. Despite their symptoms, Elizabeth says many of the group struggled to get tested. She ended up going through the Seattle Flu Study, and was quickly told she was positive. She has now completed her self-isolation period and the symptoms have gone but sheaposs still being very careful. She said: I have surpassed both deadlines so I am no longer isolating myself however I am avoiding strenuous activity and large crowds and I obviously will not come near youI see you in public. She now has a warning for people around the world as coronavirus continues to spread. She said: Hand washing doesn’t guarantee you won’t get sick, especially when folks without symptoms are contagious and could be standing right next to you in any given social situation.  You more likely than not will not die, but do you want to risk spreading it to a loved one over  or someone with an immunity issue  Stay healthy folks! I also truly believe the lack of testing is leading to folks believing that they just have a cold or something  going out into public and spreading it. And worse folks with no symptoms are also spreading it as in the case of a person attending a party or social gathering who has no symptoms. I know some folks are thinking that this can’t won’t impact them. I hope it doesn’t but I believe that the overall lack of early and pervasive testing damaged the public’s ability to avoid the illness here in Seattle. All I know is that Seattle has been severely impacted and although I’m better now I would not wish this very uncomfortable illness on anyone.  Elizabethaposs post in full I had COVID- and here is my story. I made this post public out of several requests from my friends who asked me to share. I hope it gives you some good information and peace of mind! First how easily you can get it. I believe I caught it when attending a small house party at which no one was coughing, sneezing or otherwise displaying any symptoms of illness. It appears that % of the attendees of this party ended up sick. The media tells you to wash your hands and avoid anyone with symptoms. I did. There is no way to avoid catching this except avoiding all other humans. % of folks were all sick within  days of attending the party all with the same similar symptoms including fever.  Second, the symptoms appear to be dferent depending on your constitution and or age. Most of my friends who got it were in their late s to early s. I’m in my mid s. For us it was headache, fever , severe body aches and joint pain, and severe fatigue. I had a fever that spiked the first night to  degrees and eventually came down to  and then low grade .. Some folks had diarrhea. I felt nauseous one day.Once the fever is gone some were left with nasal congestion, sore throat . Only a very few of us had a mild itchy cough. Very few had chest tightness or other respiratory symptoms. Total duration of illness was - days. The main issue is that without reporting a cough or trouble breathing many of us were refused testing. I got tested through the  Seattle Flu Study . This is a RESEARCH study here in Seattle and they have been testing volunteers for strains of the flu to study transmission within the community. A few weeks ago, they started to test a random subset of samples for COVID- infection. They sent my sample to the King County Public Health Department for confirmation however, I was told that all of the samples that have tested positive in the research study have been confirmed by Public Health. As of Monday March th, it has been  days since my symptoms started and more than  hours since my fever subsided. The King County Public Health Department is recommending you stay isolated for  days after the start of symptoms or  hours after your fever subsides. I have surpassed both deadlines so I am no longer isolating myself however I am avoiding strenuous activity and large crowds and I obviously will not come near youI see you in public. I was not hospitalized. Not every country is hospitalizing everyone with a COVID- infection and in my case, and in many other cases, I didn’t even go to the doctor because I was recovering on my own and felt it was just a nasty flu strain dferent from the ones I have been protected from with this season’s flu vaccine.  I also truly believe the lack of testing is leading to folks believing that they just have a cold or something  going out into public and spreading it. And worse folks with no symptoms are also spreading it as in the case of a person attending a party or social gathering who has no symptoms. I know some folks are thinking that this can’t won’t impact them. I hope it doesn’t but I believe that the overall lack of early and pervasive testing damaged the public’s ability to avoid the illness here in Seattle.

Picking up on the left of the penalty area, he squared up Paul Watson but could only swerve his effort wide four minutes before the interval.Just a minute later, United looked in as Shankland stood up a ball for McMullan to attack in the six-yard box but Daniel Harvie was able to get back in and clear off the line with Doohan stranded.Harkes was at the centre of what United did well in the opening moments of the second period, forcing a corner with his deep cross and making a late run into the box in an attempt to race onto Bingham#s through ball.On  minutes, Dillon Powers, useful at set-plays all night, found Mark Connolly at the back post with a deep free-kick but the Irishman#s header across the box had no takers.Just after the hour-mark, Kelly fired a dipping free-kick over the bar for the hosts # their first chance of the half.On  minutes, Sam Roscoe acrobatically hooked a half volley over the bar as Ayr grew into proceedings once more.Harkes was again clear for United as the goal opened up for him moments later.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community.

So how did Britain look before human interventions  Dense forest  or open woodland Research now favours the latter.Plants and animals evolved in equilibrium for thousands of years before humans impacted the landscape. Essential to this balance were ‘keynote species’ including aurochs , bison and tarpan . By grazing, these animals trampled and eroded soils, dispersed seeds and redistributed nutrients, thereby keeping the forest open. This in turn encouraged growth of large trees while also creating numerous habitats and microenvironments for a wonderful ersity of plants and smaller animals.Now this bioersity is severely threatened by modern monocultures , and massive quantities of pesticides, fungicides, fertilisers and #weed# killers. It is no wonder that insect numbers have plummeted, many bird species are endangered and wild-flower meadows have virtually vanished. So could we recreate this natural order on unproductive land and save our wildle For Isabella Tree and her husband Charlie Burrell the answer is a resounding #yes#. In her book #Wilding#, Tree describes #wilding# their , acre farm at Knepp, West Sussex, that had been unproductive for years.They introduced longhorn cattle, Exmore ponies, deer and pigs but otherwise left well alone. Within months they saw a dference # most scrub was cleared, producing an explosion of plant and animal species. And where grazers were deterred by spiny or unpalatable plants, oaks emerged that will eventually form an open woodland.But Knepp is isolated. More rewilding sites are needed with wildle corridors between them to support the populations and genetic ersity essential for long-term survival.Surely parts of Argyll are ideal for rewilding. We already have beavers creating new waterways to support aquatic species – now how about some large grazers to open up the landscape and perhaps one day recreate the ancient Celtic rainforest "},{"url":null,"title":"hair raising happenings at the co op","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLochgilphead Co-op staff are on a fundraising mission which they hope will raise awareness and help overcome stigma around mental illness.Trusting her hairdresser Nicky MacDougall, from Casa in Ardrishaig, Tina Holloway will have her hair shaved off to raise funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health .Explaining why she decided to take on the challenge, Tina said: #I didn#t really think before I opened my mouth.

This is a stunning route and the views over the Sound of Jura to the islands of Islay and Gigha are a rich reward for screaming muscles on the testing climbs.This will be the third year this increasingly popular event will take to the road. As it is a sportive, the Kilberry Loop is a non-competitive event and at just short of  miles long is perfect for a first-time competitor. Of course, for more competitive cyclists who want to push themselves or who are in training, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is a great event to get a personal best.The quicker cyclists in  managed the course # which has almost  metres of climbing # in under two hours, which is quick, and there are others who complete the course inside a comfortable four hours, so there is room for all abilities.Around  cyclists of all ages took part last year, with a couple of gentlemen in their early s and those in their twenties joining in # and organisers hope this year#s sportive will attract even more athletes.To make the event even more attractive Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club hopes to include race timing for the first time. And, for the third year, the Kilberry Loop Sportive is supported by British Cycling, the nation’s largest cycling organisation and national governing body for cyclesport, which actively helps and encourages people to get into cycling.If you’d like to sign up for this year’s Kilberry Loop Sportive or want more information visit the Mid Argyll Cycling and Triathlon Club website."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part four","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAs crew for our cruise we were lucky, as we have been for the four previous years, and were able to get both the Doctor and Pilot to come again. The Purser, however, found the lure of the theatre too great and she decided to spend her holidays working with a Repertory Company in Aberdeen.Again we were lucky in having a ready-made substitute in Chris Paterson, the Pilot’s we of nearly a year’s standing. We gave her the rank of Tanky – a piece of gunroom slang meaning the midshipman who trots around with the navigator or, in other words the Pilot’s Mate.As usual at the beginning of a cruise we got up early – .am – and quickly finished up our packing, loaded the car, shut up the house, and were on our road by ten minutes past seven. It was a fine bright morning with a light southerly breeze and quite promising though the weather forecast the night before had been not too cheerful. It was dead low water at Renfrew Ferry and as there was a big convoy of Army Transports crossing from north to south there was no delay in our getting across and at .am we were at the top of The Rest having had an easy and practically trafficless trip up Loch Lomond. Twenty minutes later we had Inveraray behind us.We called in at the BRS Depot at Lochgilpheadand collected our three boxes of stores and at ten to ten arrived at Crinan having passed several yachts already making their way east. The basin was busy with in it, amongst others, Arcturus, Vivien, Makoya, Boomerang, and Tookay, most of which were homeward bound. The Fulmar was lying at the back of the basin outside a motor boat and Vanda and as we unloaded the car we had a long carry round and everything was dumped on the basin wall before being taken aboard. Luckily it was turning into a lovely day. The only fly in the ointment was the poor Major – he had developed a paralysis of his back legs the day before and could do nothing but sit where put and look pitully about and only occasionally managed to drag himself a foot or two.The Mate and Bosun after being treated to tea on board Vivien got down to unpacking and stowing our gear and while they were about it the Doctor arrived with his gear and plentul supplies of Medical Comforts, a huge cake, packets of chocolate and a big box of chocolates. Dumping his stuff with the rest on deck he and the Skipper then went to the hotel and drank success to the cruise. They learnt that the night before had been a bit of a night and Arcturus was still showing its effects rather markedly.While the Mate continued the storing the Bosun got petrol and paraffin and the Tar went up to the farm for milk and at half past twelve they, with the Doctor, had lunch. Meanwhile the Skipper had gone to Ardrishaig and got a lot of fresh storesa new screwdriver, and meths. Being too early for the steamer he, after having had a beer at The Anchor, sat on a seat near the pier and had his lunch of six cookies and a sausage roll and listened to the Test Match on a portable set a man sharing the seat had with him .The Pilot and Tanky duly came off the steamer and by half past one all were aboard and the final gear stowing was completed. The car was parked on the steep hill between the farm and the basin and the batteries were disconnected then, while the Bosun, Doctor and Pilot, shted Fulmar to outside Melora on the east wall, the Skipper and Mate went up to the shop and got some strawberry tarts.At half past two the Karma came in from sea and we went into her water but had to wait in the lock for a wee motor boat whose owner had not turned up but was due soon. While we waited a man from a big Belfast motor boat that was lying in the basin spoke to the Skipper and complimented him on the sailing directions and thanked him for them. The Skipper did his best not to look smugly gratied. We filled in the waiting time by having a cup of coffee and one was handed up to the Doctor who was waiting to see us sail.At five past three we were away under engine being waved on our way by the Doctor and promising to be at Tobermory on the following Friday to pick him up. As the wind was light west-south-west we kept the motor going until we could fetch the Dorus Mor then up went the sails and beer was indulged in to mark the start of the cruise.We went nicely for a little but the wind fell very light. An unknown yacht and Mimosa were coming south and, against the flood tide, were making nothing of it. We passed close by the latter and spoke to John Hamilton then as we headed up for the Ardluing buoy we could see her being pushed slowly back to the northwards stern first. We, too, were being carried too far to the eastward and the engine went on to get us into the Scarba Sound stream and we kept it going till up to Leica Point where the wind came away again, this time from the true west.The tide rips at Fladda were in very good form and we fairly roared through the narrows and on up to Easdale but thereafter the breeze went flukey and light ying between north-west and south-west but, as the sun was shining brightly, it was very pleasant slipping along slowly in the smooth water. There was no sign of the usual heavy swell one expects to meet either side of Easdale Point. Away up to the north between Duart and Loch Don we could see half a dozen boats, led by Cerigo, making their way south.At six o’clock we heard a poor forecast promising rain and strong winds to come and listened for a while to the Test Match and heard of the collapse of the Australians in the st innings. The glass was slowly but steadily coming back and we feared the forecast was probably on the right lines.As we came round the north-west point of Seil Island and headed over for Dun Island off Puilladobhrain the wind died and the sea turned to glass so we got the sails down and stowed and the motor was started up.As we approached Puilladobhrain we saw a nished yawl coming down from the Oban direction under power and she passed in just ahead of us. As we were to learn later she was the Sol and at her helmwas a #bearded ancient# with a shock of white hair and a white beard. As we rounded the Fulmar Beacon we passed Kerlo coming out. In the anchorage were two motor boats and as we went slowly up to the south end of the pool we passed far too close to the bows of one of them owing to the Skipper misjudging the tidal drt. One of the crew came hurriedly out on to her forecastle and frowned at us as we slipped past with only inches to spare.It was dead calm when we anchored at half past seven but we were sorry to see that the drop in the glass was now being accelerated."},{"url":null,"title":"ormsary man in oman endurance event","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAn Ormsary man is about to embark on the challenge of a letime as he cycles over ,km in a bid to be crowned BikingMan Oman .Lindsay McCrae, , will be one of only  cyclists to take part in BikingMan Oman, part of a series of ultra-endurance cycling events where competitors test their limits of strength and stamina.In , Lindsay bought a road bike through his employer#s cycle to work scheme and what started out as an active commute with a few local races thrown in for fun, soon became an opportunity to challenge himself in some of the toughest races on two wheels.His first big win came in the gruelling City to Summit duathlon from Edinburgh to Ben Nevis. The race was a half marathon of road running, km ride through Glen Coe then back on foot for the final off-road marathon summitting Ben Nevis and finishing in Fort William.Bitten by the cycling bug, he went on to win Revolve  at Brands Hatch race circuit, completing  miles and ascending , feet in  hours. Adding a second-place finish in last year#s BikingMan Portugal event against some of the sport#s top athletes means Lindsay has truly made his mark on the endurance scene.Lindsay said: #In my first few races I just wanted to see how I would get on but now I#m definitely in it to win it. I think I#m just stubborn and that#s what keeps me pushing on when other people take rest breaks.#Lindsay, who works in sales technical support for an aquaculture equipment company in Inverness, fits his training around his job, spending one to two hours on a turbo in his garage three or four times a week, with longer rides of two to five hours at the weekends. His father#s greenhouse in Ardrishaig proved to be a useful training venue to shelter from the elements over the Christmas holidays as he prepared for his biggest challenge yet.The BikingMan Oman race starts in Muscat, Oman#s capital city, before heading out on the Arabian Peninsula, through the Hajar Mountains, across the Ash Sharqiyah Desert and along coastal roads back to the capital. The competitors will climb over m during the race, that#s the equivalent of climbing Ben Nevis almost seven times.Unlike cyclists on the Tour de France, BikingMan athletes are unsupported so must carry all their food and equipment with them.For Lindsay, one of the biggest challenges will be the weather. #Temperatures at the moment are around - degrees but can reach higher which can be dficult to manage on the steeper sections of the course. That#s where my nutrition and hydration strategy will need to be spot on.#But in case it all sounds like hard work, Lindsay highlights one of the main benefits of his high-octane adventures: #The best part is definitely refuelling after the race. I will burn about , calories over the -hours of my target time, so my recovery will mainly involve eating cakes and other calorie rich foods.#Lindsay grew up on the Ormsary Estate and attended Lochgilphead High School. His family still live in the local area and will be following his adventures closely over the five days of competition.The race takes place from February  to  and Lindsay will cover ,km in a bid to take the title."},{"url":null,"title":"ceilidh to boost hall funds","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsToe-tapping tunes and a busy dance floor are on the cards for a Craignish ceilidh.Ardfern ceilidh band, All about the Cake, will take the stage and have the dancers reeling all night.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Then, from left back, Pupils’ captain Keith Mitchell wove a path between several Parkhall defenders and was unlucky to see his effort erted wide by the hosts’ keeper, amidst mounting pressure from the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils.Disappointingly, though, the visitors conceded a goal from a simple throw-in routine which undid their good work in the previous half hour, Parkhall midfielder Dougherty running off his marker and unleashing a sweet strike beyond Lamont to put Parkhall in front.Minutes later, Lamont, who was between the sticks for the team’s consecutive league titles in  and , then pulled off a wonder save to deny Parkhall a second.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils then produced another attacking spell of their own before the half-time whistle, with Liam Renton having two efforts on goal tipped round the post in the space of a minute by the Parkhall keeper.From the second save, the Pupils made the most of the resultant corner kick, when Renton delivered a swerving ball which found right winger Scott Souden, who guided a firm downward header into the Parkhall net to make it -.Into the second half, the Pupils had to weather a storm from their hosts, but found composure again and began to create excellent chances for themselves. Renton went close again from a free kick  yards out, but was denied by another fingertip save from Parkhall’s impressive keeper.Scott Souden had a chance to put the Pupils in front, after being put through on goal by a cutting through pass from Ryan Deans, but a loose touch gave the home keeper a chance to make a ing save and ert the ball wide.Then, the Pupils were pegged back for the second time when a corner from the hosts’ left-hand side was side-footed home by Parkhall’s Cannin, beyond Lamont’s clutches.Pushing hard for another equaliser, the Pupils had a lot of the play around Parkhall’s penalty area, and Donald McCallum, introduced as a substitute, pounced on a loose ball in the box from a Pupils free-kick but saw his effort blocked in the six-yard box.Into injury time, Parkhall, who had defended their lead resolutely in the closing stages, broke forward against the tide of Pupils pressure and made it - through striker Kevin Williams, who tucked a low effort into the Pupils’ net.The Pupils must now regroup for more league action tomorrowwith the visit of Neilston AFC. Kick-off is pm with Kintyre Park the expected venue.

Keith Mitchell picked up the ball on the left and released McFadyen down the left flank, from where he produced a fine low cross which substitute Donald McCallum struck low into the Neilston net with his left foot to make it -.But with some  minutes to play and the Pupils cruising, Neilston halved the deficit, a visiting striker gambling on Ferguson’s kick, and blocking it, the resulting break of the ball landing in his path for an easy finish, providing a leline to the men from East Renfrewshire.But their hopes of an equaliser would quickly fade, after a Neilston player-coach – already booked on the touchline for dissent ­– was sent off for a foul on Mitchell within a minute of entering the field of play.The same player then proceeded to throw a running punch as he left the field, before both teams became embroiled in an on-pitch melee.After the fisticuffs fizzled out, the game of football resumed and a healthy Kintyre Park crowd watched a settled final  minutes of action as the Pupils did enough to seal a welcome three points, over the team they had beaten on the road in front of the BBC Scotland cameras a month previously.Finally, midfielder Ryan Gilchrist, enjoying a regularto first-team action, was given the man-of-the-match award, with the creative energy of McFadyen another highlight for the Pupils.Tomorrowthe Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils travel to Busby on league duty, with kick-off at pm.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig. He went to Sabhal Mograver to improve his language skills and says he would not hold his present job had he not become a fluent speaker.ldquoI was fully immersed in the language at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, which is essential to become fluent in any language. he says. ldquoYou could hear Gaelic being spoken every day, in every situation and that helped me no end in improving my own Gaelic. I gained a great deal of confidence in terms of Gaelic grammar, spelling and writing, all of which has been invaluable in my working le.BBC weather presenter, Joy Dunlop, is another graduate of the college who says the fluency in Gaelic she developed at the college has given her many opportunities that she otherwise would not have had.She studied Gaelic as a second language when she was a pupil at Oban High School then decided to do her sixth year at the college. She initially planned to stay for just one year to do the Cugraversa Comais but loved it so much she stayed for four, graduating with a BAin Cagravenan agus Cultar na Gagraveidhlig .ldquoAttending Sabhal Mograver was a revelation for me, she says. ldquoThe education I received was unparalleled.ldquoThe personal support and guidance I received from all the staff was of the highest level and I always felt that our teachers were genuinely invested in both the language itself and our progress.ldquoBeing immersed in the language is definitely the best way to learn, dficult as it could be at times, and having the opportunity to speak Gaelic in both the classes and the community was a real help to me.ldquoSimply,you genuinely want to learn Gaelic, there is no better place to do so than Sabhal Mograver Ostaig.

Aside from the occasional draught which we could dodge by retreating to the back room, it was wonderfully toasty. This was in large part thanks to generous neighbours above and below whose central heating kept us permanently cocooned.In the country, as I quickly learned, in winter there are two main subjects of conversation: weather and warmth, but the greater of these is warmth. Hoolet, like many villages around here, has no gas supply, so central heating runs either by electricity or oil. The topic of electricity bills leads to much sucking in of breath, although there was one couple whose house somehow escaped the notice of the electricity board.Only when they sold up and the new owners found they werenrsquot being charged did it become clear why there had always been such a blazing array of Christmas lights in this particular garden. Rumour has it that, years earlier, a woman in this area greased a palm and had her meter erted to a lamp-post. It took a while before the extraordinarily high reading was finally noticed and an investigation began. Soon she was tracked down, along with her cannabis plants.The day is approaching when wersquoll all have to switch to renewables, but in the meantime our radiators drink oil. Every few days I check the gauge on the tank in the garden, half-closing my eyes as I pull out the pin and watch it drop one inch, then two. Since it can take over a week between ordering and getting a refill, you have to estimate how long it will last. If nothing , becoming aware of every drop of oil you use does mean that, while itrsquos the least environmentally friendly of fuels, it is never squandered. One friend is so thrty her grandchildren have renamed her house The Baltic.Long before, and after, they became fashionable, everyone around here wears a gilet. People only come to their doors in a tee-shirttheyrsquove been interrupted in the process of layering. I was watching a western the other night and saw a tobacco-spitting rancher on his porch, rle under his stained armpit. What caught my attention was his long-johns, the sort that reach from ankle to chin to wrist, with buttons down the front. Theyrsquore exactly what I need.Other than the relief of seeing the orange lights of the oil tanker arriving in the pitch black of a winterrsquos morning, there is nothing interesting about oil. Our other source of heat, however, is wood-burning stoves, and on this subject I could win Mastermind. We have two, which possibly saved my husbandrsquos le. When the Beast From the East descended on Hoolet, he was left with a gaping hole in the kitchen wall where the boiler had been taken out moments before the blizzard started. The heating engineers fled to get over Soutra Hill before they were snowed in, and his ordeal began: two log fires and two hot water bottles to get him through five days until the roads reopened. When he went into the kitchen to cook dinner, he had to wear hat and gloves as well as his puffa jacket.There is nothing more comforting in the cold than a roaring fire. In rural parts this is not a lestyle choice but an absolute necessity. Of an evening we get through about five logs, which is enough to keep a large room really cosy. When we started out, we were so ignorant wersquod never even heard the phrase ldquokiln dried and ndash Irsquom going beetroot just thinking about it ndash we bought logs in bags from BQ. Now, having found a good supplier, and with our own woodstore, the first thing we notice as we drive around the area is other peoplersquos woodpiles.Some are works of art, high as a gable end and stacked so expertly theyrsquore as solid as drystane dykes. A few keep them in a ramshackle heap, out in the open, where they soak up the rain. Quite apart from the level of emissions wet wood produces, which is why itrsquos high on the governmentrsquos hit-list, it is far less efficient, generating less warmth and more smoke. Butyoursquore patient, green wood dries out ndash Irsquove heard you should wait two years for anything yoursquove cut down yourself. My father would have scoffed at that, as hersquod bring the car to a sudden halt, nip out and drag a huge storm-tossed branch into the boot ndash ldquotidying up the countryside as he put it. Back home, he stoked the flames so high we had to push the furniture back against the walls and open the living room door.The other day we had a delivery of ash, dumped in front of the house in a crate big enough to hold a wild boar. As the lumberjack was in bed barking like a sea-lion, it fell to me to deal with it. I was well on my way when Lazarus rose from the duvet to check on the proceedings and pointed out that I was laying them sideways rather than end-on. As the sun disappeared and clouds gathered I started again. By this time a neighbour had spotted me, and helped me finish the job.The sense of satisfaction in having it all safely stored, shortly before snowfall, was incalculable. Thatrsquos the thing about wood. The connection between you and the trees yoursquore burning creates a new respect and understanding. For a start, freshly chopped logs give off a delicious scent. And each one is dferent ndash whorled, fissured, misshapen, or neatly wedged like a giant slice of cake. If you chose to count the rings yoursquod see how many years had gone into making a blaze that lasts only a few hours."},{"url":null,"title":"music-review-elvis-costello-imposters-usher-hall-edinburgh","story":"Elvis Costello  The ImpostersUsher Hall, EdinburghKeith Brucefour starsALMOST  years ago, vocal trio Afrodiziak were, alongside a horn section, an extra ingredient of the expanded line-up of The Attractions for Elvis Costellorsquos Punch the Clock album. At  years old the canny Mr C has again added two fine backing singers, Kitten Kuroiand Briana Lee, to his touring group and they are now more essential support for his own lead vocal. Initially, in fact, we could have heard rather more of them in what was a ropey sound mix for Strict Time and Clubland, two tracks from rsquos Trust album, which this ldquoJust Trust tour is emphatically not showcasing, according to the man himself.It was on songs recorded with Kuroiand Lee, Suspect My Tears and Burnt Sugar Is So Bitter, from the Grammy Award-winning  set, Look Now, that they came into their own, setting the template for the triumphant final third of a full two hours of music.

It could be that the disruption caused by the coronavirus will turn out to be a relative blip and le willto normal, including regular travel abroad. Soon enough, the crowds could be back.It is not guaranteed, though. Travel, even at the best of times, is becoming more trouble than it is worth. Holidays abroad are increasingly spent recovering from the trip there and steeling oneself for the journey back. Hell is the modern airport.Given this, and increased awareness of climate change, more people will want to holiday close to home. Those who come from further afield will expect as eco-friendly a holiday as possible once they get here.Scotland is ideally placed to do well out of these changes. Or it would bewe had a transport system that was not a national embarrassment.The latest snafu is the cancellation of sailings between Brodick and Ardrossan. This is the busiest route in the CalMac network, serving , passengers. It is a flagship service in every sense, essential to Arran residents, businesses, and the wider tourist industry.There cannot be many Scots families who have not spent holidays on Arran. It is a fantastic island, the kind of place most countries would love to have a ferry ride away. The tourist board punts it as ldquoScotland in miniature but a better tag might be ldquoLike Vancouver Island, but closer.: Further ferry delays fearedNot only do Scots make good use of it, we recommend it, and indeed the rest of Scotland, wherever we go in the world. Yoursquoll have a great time, we tell people. To that we should add ldquoas long as you go at the right time.As far as travelling to Arran goes, now is not the best of times. It emerged this week that due to a fault with the mooring equipment ships can no longer berth safely in bad weather. According to CalMac the repairs could take up to six weeks, which runs right into the peak Easter holiday period.Why will it take so long  Because CalMac needs to source spare parts. If the parts were so essential one might imagine they would be held in stock, but that is to assume a level of efficiency that is proving beyond the service operators and their ultimate bosses, the Scottish Government.The latest problems take place against the backdrop of spiralling costs and y delays in the delivery of two new ferries. Vessels that should have cost pound million are now priced at more than double that, and they will not be in operation till  at least.Gavin Fulton, chair of Arran Ferry Action Group, has described the situation as ldquoa shambles. He told The Heraldrsquos reporter Martin Williams that patients on the island were having to spend up to five days on the mainland just to get to a hospital appointment and back.ldquoThings are going from bad to worse for us and there is no contingency plan, he added. ldquoThere is no word of chartering a boat, or to buy one abroad. It is a case of waiting  months for a new ferry and we have to put up with it.Mr Fulton is not alone in his despair. Another essential route, at the Rest and Be Thankful, is prone to closure due to landslips, forcing drivers on a -mile detour. It was announced recently that more millions are to be spent on repairs rather than a reroute of the A. Iain Jurgensen of the Argyll and The Isles Tourism Co-operative said it was ldquostaggering and irresponsible to keep spending public money on patching the problem rather than sorting it out once and for all.: Anger as services haltedIt is not just rural areas that are suffering from the lack of a joined up transport system in Scotland. Rail travel between two of the countryrsquos biggest cities is expensive, unreliable and overcrowded. Bus services across the country y wildly in price and efficiency. In Glasgow the subway does not operate on a Sunday evening. Too often the only way to ensure getting somewhere on time is to go by car, and even then good luck with the potholes.Of course there have been successes, chief among them the Queensferry Crossing. Leaving aside recent closures due to snow and ice the bridge was delivered with only a slight delay, again due to weather, and under budget, something of a miracle for large projects.Yet the Queensferry Crossing aside, Scotlandrsquos transport is too often in reverse or going nowhere fast.Part of the problem is that the subject has become politicised, alongside much  in Scottish le. Take the recent Queensferry Crossing closures. Instead of having a rational discussion about them, the row became another proxy war over Scottish independence. Criticising Scotlandrsquos transport, like questioning educational attainment or NHS waiting times, is seen as ldquotalking Scotland down.It would be funnyit was not so ridiculous. When you travel to another country you donrsquot give two toots of a horn who built what road and when, or who runs the ferry service.: Time to end monopoly of ownershipAll the traveller wants is a reliable service that will take them where they want to go at a reasonable cost both to themselves and the planet. That is what Scots desire as well, and it is not too much to ask.Transport is such an obvious building block for any successful country it should be above political bickering. Even given the problems of geography, it should not be beyond our ability to build a national transport infrastructure that works for all the people most of the time.Since nothing broadens the mind on transport like using the system, herersquos a suggestion. If more of our MPs and MSPs were to venture outside the Central Belt they could see the problems for themselves. Perhaps, once this latest spell of disruption is over, some of them could try commuting from Arran for a spell, or venture beyond the Rest and Be Thankful.Donrsquot forget to send us a postcardand when you arrive."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11137154.jpg?type=article-full","title":"first-minister-intervention-call-parlous-state-scotlands-busiest-ferry","story":"At least half the scheduled sailings between Brodick on the isle of Arran and Ardrossan were cancelled on Wednesday, with further journeys due to be dropped on Thursday because of a fault with the ageing ferrys mooring equipment.

We can expect both a full statement on the public expenditure plans and another Budget per se, as the year progresses. Some procrastination on other topics was excusable.Despite the inevitable focus on mitigating the effects of the virus it is still essential to ask questions about the macro and the micro implications of this Budget. The macro relates to the overall state of the economy, past and projected, along with the budgetary ldquostance. The micro considers more the inidual measures announced, including changes in taxation or patterns of expenditure. How do these relate to the needs of the economy and stated Government objectives For plausibility it was essential for this Budget to include measures to help achieve the Governmentrsquos target on reducing CO emissions and to counter the growing menace of flooding.Consider first the actions related the adverse effects of the coronavirus. Here action was necessary to shore up theimpacts on both the supply and demand sides of our economy ndash in addition, of course, to resource availability for the NHS.Inevitably the Government deficit will rise in the coming year. However, Mr Sunak still committed to staying within the fiscal rules included in the last manesto. He confirmed that the Office for Budget Responsibilitywas forecasting a current account surplus in each of the next five years and an overall level of Government debt lower at the end of the Parliament than now albeit with the overall Government deficit rising for a period before it fell back.The OBR forecasts for GDP growth were made before the virus risks materialised, and they are still very disappointing. Growth was expected to be very weak this year, then to accelerate a touch in , before averaging just .% in the following three years ndash with the OBR forecast for productivity growth revised down again.This is where the Government hopes for a major positive impact from their massive commitment on infrastructure spend. It had been pre-announced that the Treasury would increase funding for infrastructure projects to the highest level in real terms since  ndash more than poundbn over the five-year term.This was a massive positive for the Chancellor to throw into the mix and includes major increases in funding for RD investment plus substantial new streams of funding for broadband, railways and roads. The expenditure, we are told, is to be well distributed geographically. It was suggested that the OBR believes this major boost to investment could result in productivity being .% higher than now at the end of the Parliament. We shall see.There were also more funds for flood protection and climate change mitigation measures ndash forests and peat bogs, red diesel subsidies abolished for most sectorsand more charging points for electric vehicles. More detail will come in the fullness of time.Inevitably emphasis was on the short-term risks of the coronavirus. We must welcome the efforts to shore up supply and demand, and hope the impact proves to be relatively short-term. It is good news that this year the fiscal stance has been eased markedly, alongside that cut in interest rates.This was very much needed. But fiscal credibility and sustainability are also critical and hence the retention of the fiscal framework, at least until a review is completed in the autumn, is another positive.There will be a substantial feed-through of funds to Scotland via the Barnett formula, with more big tax and spend decisions required. A final thought is that Mr Sunak pledged pound.bn over five years to further education. Similar commitment to FE in Scotland must be a priority.Jeremy Peat is Visiting Professor at the University of Strathclyde"},{"url":null,"title":"home-office-tell-83-year-old-chilean-dad-glasgow-go-home-nigeria","story":"Myriam Giesen, from Riddrie, wants her dad Carlos Giesen Martinez to be allowed to stay inScotlandso she can look after him.Mr Giesen has strong links to Glasgow stretching back more than  years, having resided here from  to  as a political refugee during the General Augusto Pinochet regime.: More than three million EU citizens have applied to live in UK after BrexitWhile here he met and married his late we, Jean and adopted their daughter Myriam.Despite travelling from South America to Europe last year and spending most of the last five years between Scotland and Chile he has been told by the Home Office he should go back to Africa.The Glasgow Times reported how, ina written decision, the Home Office refused the application and told Mr Giesen ldquoYou should have prepared yourself for the possibility ofto Nigeria.The Home Office said it was a ldquomistake but Ms Giesen believes it to be a symptom of lack of attention being paid to decisions that seriously affect peoplersquos lives.Mr Geisenrsquos daughter and his lawyer believe the section citing Nigeria has been ldquocut and pasted from another refusal to a dferent applicant and is evidence the claim has not been given proper consideration.The Home Office also said Mr Giesen has been resident in Chile for  years, despite him having lived in the UK for  years.It also states, ldquoyou have indicated that you could be in danger of detention and torture due to the current state of affairs back in your country of origin, Chile.But no fear of torture or detention was raised and the only grounds for applying for leave to remain is on the basis of his relationship with his daughter and due to having no family or friends in Chile, except a grandson who is unable to commit to caring due to work.Carlos Giesen Martinez met daughter Myriams mother Jean after fleeing Chile for Scotland during the brutal Pinochet regime.The reason for the application is on compassionate grounds that he is not capable of caring for himself entirely in Chile.The application was made on the grounds of ldquoobstacles he would face reintegrating to le in Chile.It has been submitted that removing him would be a breach of his human rights and be disproportionate in the circumstances,resulting in unjustiably harsh consequences for both himself and his family.The application also stated Ms Giesen has sufficient income to support her father without recourse to public funds.Myriam said: ldquoI am the only person who can take care of him.

It will be very strange to be getting updates from people south watching Orkney while I#m watching Orkney at home.#This topic actually was included in #s Knowledge newsletter where a crack team of anoraks answer some of the most obscure questions on footballing knowledge.One twitter user asked: “Has a professional team in living memory had to play twice in a day ”The question attracted several responses.#If you go back a century or more, this wasn’t unusual, and arose from teams who were unable to play in midweekand having to cram in postponed games before an end-of-season deadline,” writes Andrew Wright, citing several in Scotland including Celtic’s wins over Raith and Motherwell on April , .“Argentina and Uruguay have played each other twice on the same day three times,” Andrew continues. “In , they played friendlies in Montevideo and Buenos Aires on  April. Given the distance between these cities is km, I doubt the same players were involved. Uruguay won - at home and drew - away. They repeated the exercise on July , with Uruguay winning - at home and drawing - away.#On October , , they played for the Uruguayan Honour Cup in Montevideo, with Argentina winning -, and the same day, in Avellaneda for the Lipton Cup, where Argentina again won -.#He also unearths a more recent example from an African football blog: Nairobi’s Gor Mahia played KTM Thika and Kericho Allstars on the same day in the s.Brazil have also crammed two fixtures into a day, adds Amadeu Faccini Avi, drawing - with the Soviet Union and beating Hungary - in , one in Rio and one in São Paulo.Staying in Brazil, São Paulo beat Sporting Cristal - in the Conmebol Cup on the same dayas a - triumph over Grêmio. Not to be outdone, Grêmio played three games on one day in , against Aimoré, Santa Cruz and Brasil de Pelotas, all in their state cup.“Thirty-four players were involved and three of them played more than once,” Amadeu adds.In England, Everton once played three matches in two days in , writes Tim Lawrence — in the Lancashire Cup against Blackburn on Christmas morning followed by an annual exhibition against Ulster FC in the afternoon, winning both. The following day they wearily drew - with Bootle.Most recently, Hornchurch of the Ryman League had to play two games in a day at the end of the   season and in Wales, Mark Barnes recalls a youthful Wrexham side, who took on Airbus in the Welsh Cup in December , kicking-off a mere half hour before a more experienced Red Dragons selection beat Brentford in the FA Cup.A link to the article is here.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This data will then be used in further assessing the viability of the sites.The masts are due to be installed at Quanterness and Hoy by the end of March — with a dferent kind of measurement system being used at the site in Faray.Planning permission for the masts was approved in December last year.Meteorological masts are an assembly of bolted, galvanised steel tube sections, consisting of a series of anemometers, wind vanes and a data logger, solar , temperature sensor and antenna. The equipment gathers a range of meteorological data in order to provide a detailed understanding of the area’s wind characteristics.The masts will be up to  metres in height and will be in place for up to two years.If the Community Wind Farm Project#s proposals and sites are found through the planning process to be appropriate and the project goes forward, OIC believes it could generate signicant income and community benefit for Orkney. The council has stated that all profit would stay in the islands, enabling OIC to preserve and enhance key services that local people value and depend upon and providing a foundation for communities to drive transformational projects of their own.The council also hopes that developments will also allow it to join other local developers in making a meaningful contribution to a needs case for a new interconnector for Orkney, with the aim of substantially supporting the vital renewable energy industry in Orkney.Due to practical limitations, the Faray site has already had a Lidar system installed to measure wind speed and direction.  Lidar stands for Light Detection and Ranging and is very similar to radar.The proposed Quanterness site has the potential capacity for six turbines and the site on Faray has enough space for up to seven turbines. The current proposal at the site in Hoy is to erect seven turbines at a blade tip height of up to .m.Pre-application consultation for the proposed site at Quanterness took place in November last year and a planning application was lodged with the planning authority in January. OIC has since written to the Scottish Government to ask that they call in the application, on grounds of national signicance.Further public consultation events are planned for Hoy in March, with Faray events in Eday and Westray likely to take place in May.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

From the former perspective, the big positive about the Scots so far this year is that they have conceded the fewest tries and the least points of any of the six teams. Few would have predicted that a month ago.Hamish Watson got the nod for man of the match against the Italians, another indication that the open-side flanker is back to his very best. Others to stand out were loose-head prop Rory Sutherland, the find of the tournament, and Watson’s back row colleague Jamie Ritchie.Elsewhere at the weekend France proved just too good for Wales in Cardf, and are now the only side left with the chance of a Grand Slam. The French have been very impressive this season and have about five or six players who would be in a combined Six Nations team so far.At Twickenham there was a typical battle between two outfits who prefer brute strength to artistry. What little flair was evident mostly emanated from Ireland in the latter stages, but England had got so far ahead by half-time the game was really over.Sadly once again we had a referee, this time Jaco Peyper, seemingly unwilling to penalise a side which is consistently in breach of the offside rule.Irish fly-half Jonny Sexton, who had an awful game himself including making a complete mess of two kicks, could regularly be seen complaining to the referee. That even included pointing to players who were blatantly in the wrong place, but Peyper refused to take action.Only midway through the second half, when the Irish were all but buried, did Peyper appear to notice that so many white shirts were lying on the wrong side of the ball. I found that absolutely baffling.A week on Sunday Scotland will be in action again, this time back at Murrayfield against leaders France. That could be close, with the French chasing a clean sweep and the Scots still harbouring hopes of finishing third or fourth in the table.While the Finn Russell saga shows no sign of sorting itself out, and Adam Hastings likely to continue at number  despite being out of touch against Italy, it would be good to have a couple of players back from injury. The presence of either winger Darcy Graham and lock back row Sam Skinner would strengthen things in both departments.Team of the tournament so far: Elliot DalyJonny May , Robbie Henshaw , Gael Fickou , Mattia BelliniRomain Ntamack , Antoine DupontC J Stander , Jamie Ritchie , Gregory AlldrittAlun Wyn Jones , Bernard Le RouxRory Sutherland , Julien Marchand , Joe Marler .: : : : : : : :Two of my favourite footballers, in my opinion the greatest ever strikers from their respective international sides, celebrated their th birthdays over the past week.Last Thursday it was the turn of Jimmy Greaves, who sadly is not in good health having suffered a serious stroke five years ago.A documentary on BT Sport that evening covered all aspects of Greaves’ career, ranging from his early days at Cha, a big money move to AC Milan, theto Tottenham Hotspur, the shock transfer to West Ham and his final days in non-league football.The programme also touched on the hepatitis which he suffered from during the - season. He was warned that he would lose up to a yard in pace as a result of the illness, but bounced back with four goals in an away victory over Norway.Then came the  World Cup, an injury against France and Greaves’ omission from the side for the final. To see his replacement Geoff Hurst, who was an inferior player, score a hat trick and ultimately receive a knighthood, must have been dficult for Greaves. But typically he was magnanimous about the issue.At the end of his West Ham career Greaves succumbed to severe alcoholism, which brought his contract to an end. After four years away from the game he made a comeback with Barnet among other non-league clubs, and although still impressive his best was long gone.Greaves later forged a new career in television, first with Star Soccer and then more famously as the funny half of the Saint and Greavsie double act with Ian St John.I have to laugh when the likes of Gary Lineker and Harry Kane are sometimes compared to Greaves. Watching old footage reveals how a good number of his goals involved running from just inside the opposition half, beating two or three players and then rounding the keeper. Comparison  There really is none.On Monday it was the th for Denis Law, my boyhood hero and favourite player of all time.Law has also not enjoyed the best of health, suffering from debilitating eye problems and also from prostate cancer. But happily he appears to be in reasonable fettle at the moment, well enough to appear at the recent BBC Sports Personality of the Year event and attend former Manchester United team mate Harry Gregg’s funeral at the weekend.They say it is not always advisable to meet your heroes, but I would gladly pay money to interview Law.: : : : : : : :It was reported last week that Neil Fenwick is in the frame for the Shetland football manager’s job.If that turns out to be the case then good luck to the Lerwick Spurs player coach.When the position was first advertised last year the wording suggested it would be a dficult task, with the applicant likely to need a strong back-up team. That probably explains why so few people came forward.I’m not convinced anyone needs to be going through an interview process over this. None of the most successful people to have held the position were subjected to such scrutiny, and they mostly did the job very well.If Fenwick is indeed the man, let’s all get behind him.: : : : : : : :There is obviously still plenty of power in the conveyor belt which produces Shetland athletics talent, as evidenced by the success of young Layla Todd at the weekend.The -year-old’s fourth-place finish in the Scottish National Cross Country Championships was a tremendous achievement, a credit to both her and her coaches.With distance runner Seumas MacKay now too old for the junior inter-county squad and sprinter Katie Dinwoodie just having a year or two left, it will be necessary for younger competitors to fill the void. Todd will likely be one of those in the frame soon for the , metres event.: : : : : : : :Boxer Tyson Fury’s display against Deontay Wilder on Sunday morning, to claim the WBC heavyweight crown, was sensational.After the previous draw between the two, when Fury was ahead on points but floored twice late on, many predicted that this time Wilder would have his measure. No chance.Whatever you think of the so-called “gypsy king”, who has not always endeared himself to the general public, he is massive box-office entertainment.Wilder may still be given a third fight, which would be disappointing, or Fury’s next outing could be a unication battle with fellow Briton Anthony Joshua.That could well be a mismatch, as Fury appears to be in a dferent league from the muscle-bound Joshua.

My love of music comes from sitting in the back bedroom of the house listening to my parentsrecord collection, Jim Reeves, The Platters, Bobby Darrin and Ray Charles amongst others.My sister Patricia and I would also try and listen to Radio Luxemburg and Radio when we were not be asked to turn it down!For many years I was a DJ in the town, mobile at the start but ended up working in clubs, got to perform in Burberrys, Kelly’s amongst others, but ended up in Tullyglass- Maxwells Plum!For the last  years of that type of work, stopped when I was  as I just didn’t want to play the dance music they wanted me too!I used to promote bands in the George and McKendry’s, best bands at that time on the local circuit where, Ghost of an American Airman, Carpenter Joe, Violet Sky and the famous Blues Brothers nights with Otis and the Elevators, great days indeed.I suppose my lasting mark will be as a founder member of Radio Cracker in Ballymena, along with Andy Thompson, Ernie Kilpatrick and many others So, here’s my Top  in no particular order –. Van Morrison – Tupelo Honey, lesser known song from the Belfast Cowboy that in all the times I have seen him live, he has naturally never played!. The Waterboys – Whole of the Moon - just a wonderful anthem of my youth and still such a great song today, took me a long time to realise the lyric was a comparison between two people, “I see the crescent, you see the whole of the moon”. Sam Baker – Broken Fingers, a Texan who “got caught up in someone ’s war” after terrible injuries learned to play the guitar again and wrote this song about the process, read the back story before listening.. Dr Feelgood – All Through the City – first live band I seen in Belfast at  years old, had a huge impact on me and after all these years, Jim Bolan thank you for taking me!. Foy Vance – Two Shades of Hope – a wonderful singer songwriter from our wee country, and what a song!. Linda Rondstadt – Your No Good - I have probably bought this album times in dferent formats, loved it from no age.. David Bowie – Heroes - A song and artist who came alive for me when I went to Live Aid with John Connor in , best performance of the day . Bap Kennedy – Working Man – from the fantastic Sailors Revenge album, sadly Bap is not with us anymore, greatly missed. Was lucky enough to have him play at my th birthday party in the BT club, Vincent Close got him to do some Energy Orchard stuff!. Van Morrison – Into the Mystic- is there a better song to raise the spirit, “let your soul and spirit fly into the mystic” ace. The Undertones – You’ve got my number , I could be spotted from an early age jumping up and down on a dance floorafter forcing a DJto play it!

Dan Redmond was brought up in a supportive family but dogged through his youth by violence - and this had him walking a fine line with authority.JAPANAs many people will attest who have been through similar and often damaging experiences, it was the martial arts that pretty much saved Dan, gave him direction and steadied the ship. “Eventually his pursuit of knowledge and the best training in karate took him to such places as mainland Japan, Okinawa and the USA on a number of occasions.Over the years, Dan has built up a very solid reputation in the karate world and his journey through le with the martial arts as his compass is engagingly told in this well written biography.

His mother had told him to run to her brother’s house to find refuge: the military had already come in the night and killed his father and his brother, and he was likely to be in similar danger. That night, the military forced his mother to sign over ownership of their family farm to the state.Eskander had been imprisoned for four months in an underground prison in Ethiopia without his family’s knowledge, almost one hundred miles away from their farmstead in Dima. Dima is in the Ethiopian regional state of Oromia, the homeland of the Oromo people: a large minority ethnic group who have been subject to political oppression, cultural suppression and the victims of internment and state violence. He had been taking part in a student protest at the technical college where he was studying electrical engineering, carrying a placard that read Stop Killing Oromo People, when the military arrived and opened fire on the protest group. Between forty and fty of the students were arrested and taken to a military camp. From there, he was sent to the underground prison where he was beaten with sticks, cut with knives and tortured with hot metal bars. His body is still marked with the scars from this torture. All of this happened in , and the following year, after he’d lived in hiding with his uncle for five months, his mother sold her possessions to raise funds for Eskander to escape Ethiopia to the relative safety of South Sudan.In April  he left Ethiopia. This was only the beginning of a decade of turmoil that saw the teenage college student progress through his twenties working for two years without pay on a building site in Sudan, imprisoned in Libya by people smugglers, crossing the Mediterranean in a plastic dinghy, being subjected to a brutal assault by a group of men in Italy, living in a bus station near Milan and spending time in Direct Provision in Monaghan before finally boarding a bus to seek a new le of safety in Belfast in April . He claimed asylum, but refugee status and the stability that comes with it has not yet been granted.All of this was written in a statement he’d made for the Home Office through an interpreter. It will form part of his application to be granted five years leave to remain. He sat in silence as I read it all in a coffee shop on the Ormeau Road along with our running coach at Annadale Striders, Michael McKnight. We had gotten to know Eskander well in the preceding year and his positivity and enthusiasm for running had won us over. The scale of the horror he’d been through was until then unknown to us. After he arrived in Ireland, a doctor in the south suggested that running would be a good way of helping to manage the trauma of his experiences, and he was a natural.“I ran my first race on St Patrick’s Day, , in Dublin, with no training,” he told me, “and I ran eighteen minutes for k. I wore thin shoes from Lidl.”He was a natural and he stepped up his training while living in Monaghan, winning many races, and the medals and trophies he won adorn his bedside table in his small room in Stranmillis, along with newspaper cuttings about his athletic achievements. His dedication to running is unwavering, and to those who know his story his successes have been inspirational. He has been on the podium of many road races in the north, including the Laganside k and the Armagh International k, and has matched the course record time at Ormeau Parkrun. The week after he matched the record, dragging me along with him to a personal best of under sixteen minutes, the two of us ed and he was treated like a celebrity: I was approached by several people excitedly asking “do you think Eskander can break the record this time ”For all his talent on the road, it’s cross-country racing where he really shines. At the McConnell Shield race in Ballyclare, one of the north’s oldest and most prestigious races, he put in a stellar performance against some of our best runners. When I crossed the line at that race, Paul Lawther, an original Annadale Strider, and a one-time NI record holder at every distance from m to ,m, immediately said to me with sheer delight: “Did you see what Eskander just did ” He had put a ten second gap on the field in the last four hundred metres, beating two Northern Ireland international athletes. Recently, he finished in second place overall at the prestigious NI and Ulster Senior Cross- Country Championship.It would appear that this is barely scraping the surface of his potential. Michael McKnight has talked with Athletics NI officials about Eskander’s talents and the international representation that could easily follow. Eskander himself dreams of running for Ireland at the European Cross-Country Championships.“I want to make a story for Belfast, for athletics and for Ireland,” he told me.For any of that to happen he needs to negotiate the dficult process of gaining refugee status. He often jokes with me that next year he’s “going to Kenya to train withEliud Kipchoge”, but when it comes down to it he says that what he really wants is “independence and safety, to be free from distress and to be able to breathe in peace again”.Eskander’s gentle manner belies the deep effects of the events of the last decade, of the toll they have taken on his body and mind. He tells me that he continues to require medication to manage the effects of the trauma, to cope with depression and to allow him to sleep. He feels that this is his last chance to make a le for himself he is committed to studying several days each week in Belfast Met, developing his spoken and written English. He tells me that he cherishes his friends and the sense of community he has found in Belfast, that he has been accepted to continue with his study of electrical engineering that was ended abruptly at the time of his imprisonment, but it depends on the Home Office’s decision. He tells me with increasing desperation that he hopes the Home Office will give him another chance at le."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"invest ni host 319 visits by investors but only 14 came to west of","story":"ONLY  visits were made to the West Belfast constituency by potential inward investors, hosted by economic development agency Invest NI, compared to  in South Belfast new figures reveal.The figures for   also show that East Belfast received  visits, while North Belfast had  visits. West Belfast is continually at the bottom of Invest NI inward investor figures for the city.West Belfast MP Paul Maskey told the Andersonstown News that he has already requested a meeting with the newly appointed Invest NI CEO Kevin Holland to discuss his concerns and how the agency has “treated West Belfast over the years”.“It is clear that these figures highlight the inequalities in certain areas,” he said.“Invest NI have a history of igoring areas like West Belfast over the years and I will be stating that quite clearly at the meeting. Thankfully the unemployment rate in West Belfast has reduced in recent years, but it could be further reducedInvest NI stepped up to the mark and brought potential investors to this part of the city.“I will also be raising with them about their lands in West Belfast and what they plan to do to ensure they are used and developed to assist future investors. I will be insisting the new CEO recies this ongoing inequality as a matter of urgency.”SDLP representative Paul Doherty said that with signicantly less inward investment visits taking place here than in other parts of the city, West Belfast is yet again “being left behind”.“We want to see all of Belfast prosper, but this is simply unacceptable given the level of high unemployment and ongoing disadvantage experienced by the people of West Belfast.“I will be calling for an urgent meeting with Invest NI to seek clarity on why West Belfast continues to receive unfair treatment. Invest NI has a responsibility to target areas of need and I will be making it clear to them that they must ensure that West Belfast is given greater priority going forward.”The local rep said it is understandable why Invest NI have come under pressure to change the way they operate.“These figures are testimony to that. This isn’t a one-off either, we have seen similar figures year in, year out which are consistent with the decline in investment and jobs in West Belfast and a constant flow where,” he said.“At present, we have companies in West Belfast who are eager to expand and provide those all-important and much-needed employment opportunities. We also need to harness the potential of the talented workforce that already exists in West Belfast, and it is key that Invest NI assist companies in making that a reality.“I have met with some talented entrepreneurs in West Belfast in the last number of months and they too are understandably frustrated at what they see as constant missed opportunities of bringing investors to this part of the city where they can engage and pitch the potential of this area for investment.“We need to showcase West Belfast. The continued growth of Huhtamaki, based just off Kennedy Way, is further proof that West Belfast can be a great place for businesses to locate, but it is vital we build on that. Invest NI need to develop stronger relationships with all stakeholders in the West in order to grow current businesses such as Huhtamaki, who can continue to grow and employ more people.”A spokesperson for Invest NI said: “Invest NI and the  local councils are actively working in partnership to help grow investment and the economy in every part of Northern Ireland. Investment comes in many forms and a set of figures about the number of inward visits is not reflective of the work that is going on.“For example, nearly  per cent of Invest NI’s offers are to companies outside of Belfast, with recent investments in Derry such as the  jobs being created by Alchemy Technology Services, the  jobs being created by Fintru, the  jobs being created by Danske Bank, the  jobs being created by Terex Corporation as part of a £ million investment in a new facility in the city and expansions by Computershare and Axa.”“Addressing the point that over  per cent of inward visits go to Belfast – this should be viewed in context. The vast majority of visit programmes start in Belfast before going to other locations, or in some cases the investor has no time to visit specic locations so are hosted at our HQ in Belfast. What is more relevant is that over the last five years, nearly  per cent of investors chose to locate their project outside of Belfast.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"new inquest sought","story":"RELATIVES For Justice are to ask the Attorney General for a fresh inquest into the circumstances surrounding the death of republicanprisoner Francis Dodds.From St Katherine’s Road in St James’, Francis Doddswas sentenced to four years imprisonment in March  for possession of explosive material. The father-of-four was sent to Long Kesh, Cage , to serve out his sentence. It is understood that when Mr Dodds arrived he was in his bare feet after his shoes were confiscated. That night a serious confrontation took place which resulted in British troops being sent in to restore order. Francis was on the receiving end of a severe beating which left him heavily bandaged and needing crutches to walk.Medical notes detail how Mr Dodds consistently sought medical attention for chest pains, extending to his left arm and for a discoloured and infected big toe. The Medical Officer for the prison examined him and recommended that he be referred for an arteriogram. Despite this no arteriogram was ever carried out. On September   Francis was examined by a doctor and told he was fine. The following day, September , he collapsed and died. The post-mortem report determined that the cause of death as coronary thrombosis.Mr Dodd’s sister Joan Nolan told the Andersonstown News that any information from those who were in prison the same time as her brother would be of great help to her family’s case.“I was  when Francis died, there were six of us and Francis was the only boy. I had gone to Canada and was in Canada when Francis died. I didn’t get home for the funeral and Canada was just a nightmare then,” she said.The Dodd’s family, supported by RFJ, say Francis’ death may have been avoidedhe had been removed from Long Kesh for thorough medical examination. Joan described her brother as very much a “joker” and “young at heart”.“Francis left behind a we and four children. He would have been a very proud father with his daughter getting her -Plus and going to St Dominic’s Grammar School.“Unfortunately I’m the only one left of the family, any fresh information would be very beneficial to the family, he was my brother.”Speaking on behalf of RFJ, caseworker Paul Butler said Mr Dodds had been complaining of chest pains for several months before his death.“The prison’s medical officer had attended to him on six dferent occasions in the weeks before his death. Moreover, in April and May  – four months before he died – Francis had been taken to Lagan Valley and Royal Victoria Hospitals in relation to pain in his left foot which was also discoloured and obviously a circulation problem.“The hospital had recommended that he be referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital for an arteriogram. This is a procedure that examines the arteries to seethere are any blockages. The prison governor refused to allow this and unfortunately Francis was ed to Long Kesh and no arteriogram took place before he died.”Former prisoners can contact RFJ on   or email paul.butler@relativesforjustice"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"rising star alanna gives hope to those in distress","story":"A SPRING Ball is set to take place at the Devenish Complex with all proceeds raised from the night going towards the vital work of mental health awareness charities.‘Stand By Me’, the brainchild of local man Daniel McGinley, will take place on Friday, March  and will feature an array of vocal talent including the launch of ‘Hidden Hope’, the new album and single from rising Twinbrook talent Alanna Flynn.A songwriter since age of , Alanna told the Andersonstown News how music has always been an important part of her le and how songwriting helped her through her own struggles with mental health.“I have always wanted to make an album for charity and the reason why the proceeds raised from it and the single will go towards Suicide Awareness and Support Group is because I’ve struggled with my own mental health,” she told us. “I went through a really dark period of time, I know what’s it like to be in a dark place. Music has been my escape in a way and that has really helped me to where I am today.“Music and songwriting really helped me, I always found it hard to open up, talk about my feelings and emotions.

A lot of pressure is put on you, you’re made to do your UCAS form in school, there were people who didn’t want to go to uni when I was at school. I got accepted to go to Liverpool for Performing Arts but when it came to it I didn’t want to go, as much as I would’ve enjoyed the experience I just knew it wasn’t for me. Young people look to drugs, to alcohol, to feel better as they don’t have all the answers at that stage in their le.”She continued: “I do think we need more resources in our mental health services. This Ball is a way to help those charities that are helping others. It will be a positive night and a chance to hear that there are people that you can depend on. There will be people speaking about their own experiences but ultimately it will be an uplting night.

I#ve no idea how many homes would have been visited afterwards. Surely there is some sort of policy in place that those delivering the goods should be abiding by Tesco told the Belfastthe company has a process for allowing customers to alert a delivery driver in advancethey want their delivery left at a convenient place for collection.The delivery will be placed into bags and left as requested - but the issue is that drivers need to know this in advance. Asda and Sainsburys had not replied to a request for a response, but Andrew Opie, director of Food and Sustainability at the British Retail Consortium, said all companies are working as hard as they can to minimise the impact of the virus.Most of our members are more than happy for the majority of online deliveries to be delivered on doorsteps when customers have suggested that they are self-isolating, he said.Despite dficult times, retailers strive to provide the best service for their customers, both online and in-store and are working as hard as they can to ensure consumers have access to whatever products they want.A PHA spokesperson reiterated that it remains vital the guidelines offered to those in self-isolation are followed.People in self-isolation are expected to follow the advice they have been given to limit any potential spread of the virus.With regard to deliveries, the Public Health Agency recommends that advice developed by Public Health England on this issue is followed.This advice states: #You will need to ask for helpyou require groceries, other shopping or medications.Alternatively, you can order by phone or online. The delivery instruction needs to state that the items are to be left outside, or in the porch, or as appropriate for your home#.Last week companies including Asda and Deliveroo issued advice to delivery drivers in a move to stop them from contracting the virus.Deliveroo riders have been sent official guidelines based on the advice of the NHS and public health bodies, which include how to stay safe when delivering an order.For Asda workers, home delivery staff have been advised to follow government advice, including guidance on hand-washing.

Staff are kept informed and are getting out the message that they are open for business.The Flybe situation is a further unwelcome obstacle and reduces our air connectivity. This lessens our appeal in the GB market, our largest international visitor base.The NIHF is keeping our members appraised of The Public Health Agency guidance and will continue to do so.Government has a role to play in ensuring that support for the tourism sector is provided. It is critical that we, along with the entire Northern Ireland economy, are given allowances on rates and tax to help us through. Additional funds for promotion and campaigns are imperative once the virus recedes and weto normal market conditions.Ian McMichael, business relationship manager with leading travel agent Oasis Travel, said it continues to be a very testing time, with many people expected to holiday at home rather than travel abroad.We had the collapse of Thomas Cook in November, then Flybe and coronavirus, he said.The confidence of people in the travel industry has stalled. New business has been falling.At the minute all the news is focused on the spread of the virus, but underneath all that there#s the economic impact.We#re all keeping our fingers crossed the spread can be slowed and eventually stopped.He added: We trust that, through time, people will travel again and that common sense will prevail.We have to remain hopeful that this is a short-term thing, but there are still places to gopeople want to get away. Meanwhile, Hospitality Ulster has established an Industry Response Group to monitor and support the sector in light of the ongoing impact.Brian Murphy, chair of the group, yesterday said: We are bringing forward a range of measures that could be implemented straight away to ensure that the sector and the economy can weather this current storm.We want to preserve and ensure the ongoing livelihoods of everyone in the hospitality sector.Belfast Related ContentCoronavirusSome operations on holdThe Belfast Health Trust is scaling back on some planned operations as preparations step up to deal with an increase in the number of people with coronavirus in Northern Ireland.CoronavirusBenefit claimants reassuredThe Department for Communities has reassured benefits claimants that payments will not be affectedthey need to self-isolate.CoronavirusNW  chiefs still upbeat North West  organisers have said this year#s event is still going ahead, however they are monitoring developments around the coronavirus crisis.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Auditors from energy watchdog Ofgem have deemed this irregular spending, which is expected to hit a total of £m by the year  .In , there was a massive spike in applications to the scheme which the RHI inquiry was told was partly due to information being shared with the renewable energy industry.The then Department for Enterprise discussed possible tarf cuts to the scheme with firms in the biomass sector in the summer of that year.One civil servant told the inquiry  he thought there should have been less promotion of the scheme as officials already knew the cost for that year was twice the available budget. Ex-DUP MLA Jonathan Bell, then the minister responsible for RHI, told the inquiry that officials had not informed him of the spike in applications.It was told that one adviser said we could fill our boots as the scheme was being paid for from the Westminster budget, rather than Stormont#s.The forecast cost of the RHI scheme in   is £-m, thanks to cost controls which were put in place in . Before these changes were introduced the total cost was expected to be around £.bn, more than twice the scheme#s estimated cost of £m when it was set up in .Those who may face criticism in Sir Patrick#s report this week have already been given the opportunity to respond to his findings.The Monday following his publication, Sinn Fein Finance Minister Conor Murphy will face questions from MLAs in the Assembly.In total, the Executive#s legal bill for the inquiry is estimated at £.m, with the overall cost of the nearly year-long investigation put at £.m.The RHI scheme was launched by then economy minister Arlene Foster in  and was meant to encourage businesses to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources.But the low cost of the wood pellet fuel compared to the generous subsidies created a burn to earn scenario where boilers could be operated purely to make a profit from the scheme.Belfast Related ContentGalleryNewsDissident given le for killing prison officer Ismay undertook weapons trainingDissident killer Christie Robinson was hell-bent on killing a prison officer and underwent weapons training to prepare himself for murder.Irish League LivesIrish League Lives: Legendary keeper George Dunlop on calling time on his own glittering Blues careerBig Ivan Little takes a fair share of stick about his television gaffe many years ago when his vocabulary expertise failed him in his pronunciation of the word phenomenon.NewsDisgraced youth group leader jailed over park sex actThis is the disgraced former youth group leader who has been jailed after being caught on video committing a lewd sex act in front of three teenage girls. was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh Carl_School_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   was delighted to take Carl The Jackal Frampton, World Champion Boxer and NICIE patron to visit Glengormley High today.\"SportOpinionCarl Frampton:My integrated education came through boxing and it allowed me to develop lelong friendships with CatholicsIn some ways, Northern Ireland has moved forward and in others it has stood still and that#s why I#m so passionate about the development of integrated education across the land. sundayleThug who attacked teen with samurai sword jailed for nine yearsA man who attacked a teenager with a samurai sword has been jailed for nine years.sundayleCourt translator appears in dock himself to admit growing cannabis plantsA Northern Ireland court service interpreter has appeared in the dock himself to admit growing cannabis. from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming d .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_IMG_.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"   from Brazil, accused of causing the road death of Ballycastle man Francis Wilsonthrough careless driving.\"sundayleSouth American student charged with causing death of Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless drivingA South American student has been charged with causing the death of a Co Antrim dad-of-three by careless driving.,,,],\"customPriceBuckets\":[,,,,,],\"targeting\":Most ReadDUP man#s son told PSNI #he didn#t want to walk past Fenians#Easyjet#s £ quote for flights to Birmingham days after Flybe collapse branded #ridiculous#Derry Girls shirt insults Christianity, says Ian Paisley#s widowLyra McKee#s heartbroken mum Joan dies ahead of first anniversary of daughter#s murder Northern Ireland manon trial accused of raping his mother while she slept,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriMoneyTechnologyAnalysisTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was a great experience though and taught me how TV works.” After the show, Niall found himself in London, gigging and busking as he tried to make his way in the city’s competitive music scene.It was a city in which he found it tough to manoeuvre.“I wasn’t featured heavily in the show, so I didn’t get propelled into the spotlight.“After being in London for two years, I found myself at a bit of a standstill. I was finding it hard to meet people and a recording opportunity presented itself in Toronto.”The move across the Atlantic was aided by the fact that three of Niall’s brothers already lived in Toronto, and the Magherafelt native found a ready-made base in the city.He said: “I recorded three or four tracks within months of getting there.“I was getting my foot in the door a lot more easily with the contacts that my brother Killian made for me. “That was motivating, bearing in mind that in London, my main source of income was bar work along with busking and gigging.”In Toronto’s ‘closer-knit’ music community, Niall’s creativity blossomed, releasing his debut single – ‘Counterfeit’ - last month.“The music scene in Toronto is a lot more tailored for me. Because it’s a smaller community, I felt a lot more accepted.“I wrote ‘Counterfeit’ after I left the TV show. Initially it was an acoustic track, but the outcome has a pop, EDM vibe. “I was going through a relationship crisis and wonderingsomeone was truly into me or not, and questioning, as the hook says - is this legit, or is this counterfeit ”ExcitedHaving shaken the perception of X Factor graduates as cover artists, Niall hopes to have released an EP by the end of  and is excited about moulding his own sound.“The fact my music is hard to describe good, because it means I’ve managed to create my own sound, which I’m very happy about.”An exhilarating few years has meant opportunities to get back home to Mid Ulster have been limited, but Niall hints at an imminent .“I haven’t been home in about three years. I moved out when was  and I’ve been travelling around. I busked in Australia and New York and a few other cities in my early s.“I am probably due a visit!” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

She said: “During the past three years I was always asked to speak at a large women’s day event in Berlin – this year I made sure I can be here to visit working women on the day.“We are proud to be part of a huge and growing number of activities all over the world around the th of March.”This group of textile workers in Dungiven have been carrying out the tradition for several years after it originated in the  song ‘Bread and Roses’.ProudMarion is especially proud that it was what she describes as her ‘sisters’ in the American mills who started the movement for women’s rights.She said: “I think as textile-workers today we should feel obliged to carry on the good tradition and at the same time be aware that International Women’s Day is as far from being just a ‘historic event’ as ever.“Pointing the finger at women’s problems and their struggles is as important as it was over a hundred years ago and celebrating their successes is making us happy. “There would be no right for women to vote, nothing like equal opportunities to find work, had it not been for the struggle of women of the generations before us,” said Marion. “Much has been achieved but much more has to be gained.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I had been lobbying for it before Christmas and been given positive soundings.“Now it has been delivered and thanks to the minister for her intervention as well.“The road had fallen into a fair bit of disrepair over the last number of years and needs new resurfacing, so I’m sure all the local residents there will be very glad to see it happening.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Following the decision, the applicant Clanmil Housing Association, said it was ‘very disappointed’ and would consider the full range of options moving forward. The application was for the erection of a four-storey building comprising of  two-bedroom apartments with rooftop amenity space, new access arrangements from Victoria Road, servicing and drop off provision, bin stores, cycle parking, landscaping and associated site works. The Council’s planning department recommended that committee members approve the application with an officer saying it was entirely compliant. googletag.cmd.push It was described as possibly the most dficult regeneration site in the city, which was originally given planning approval in . It sits m below the level of the Victoria Road and is boxed in by the River Foyle and perimeter walls with limited accessibility. The application received a total of  representations,  objections and one letter of support. Of the total,  related to the amended design which incorporates a glass tower separating the two blocks. In the report it is noted that the primary objections to this development are no parking provision for residents and the adverse impact of congestion on Victoria Road caused by vehicles turning in and out of the site. googletag.cmd.push Developers proposed that there would be no parking on site, aside from operational parking, such as bin lorries and emergency services. CCTV monitoring and barrier operation would be automated for -hour operation. Planning officers said it will reinvigorate riverfront land and put an end to anti-social behaviour at the site. The natural brick was chosen to better complement the stone finish of the historic Ice House - which sits adjacent - and provide a contemporary building as recognition of the industrial heritage of the wider area. Around two stories of the building would be visible from the Victoria Road and you would see the building from lands opposite on the Foyle Road. ‘Eyesore’ Speaking at the meeting, Hugh Hegarty from the Victoria Park Residents Group raised a number of objections. He described the design as a horric brutalist East German style eyesore . He said pollution and parking problems would be exacerbatedresidents were to park on Spencer Road and Duke Street. Mr Hegarty believed Clanmil Developments would later apply for parking spaces. A lack of space in the area has already resulted in hazardous parking on Victoria Road. He envisaged problems at the site with numerous couriers and taxis arriving. The local resident questioned how it would work allowing only one vehicle on to the site at a timeother vehicles were waiting. Mistakes have been made in the past with the BT building and others near Derry’s riverfront and he hoped the planning committee wouldn’t be remembered for this carbuncle. In response, an agent representing Clanmil said the development would go some way to reducing the housing demand in Derry with around , people on the waiting list. He refuted the suggestion of a future application for car parking saying that was absolutely not the case as there will be a zero parking solution on site and people would manage deliveries. Housing applicants would be made aware that there is no car ownership in this scheme. It is a highly accessible location with bus stops and train travel nearby, he added. The agent also contended that the design respects the history of the site, the city’s shirt factory heritage and complements existing buildings. Congestion  Above: Artists impression of the building from Foyle Road. Alliance Councillor Philip McKinney who is a lorry driver said it would only take one heavy goods vehicleto block the Victoria Road and there would be massive tailbacks. “At the best of times it’s absolutely horrendous, it would only take one timed delivery to go wrong and traffic would be down past the Everglades Hotel.” He was assured there would be no disruption to traffic on the Victoria Road and told there’s enough room for one vehiclethe barrier was down. SDLP Councillor Angela Dobbins said she normally had brilliant things to say about Clanmil but on this occasion believed that the no parking clause discriminates against disabled applicants. “Disability Action will have a lot of issues with this development.” She added: “You’re saying, people can have an apartment with lovely views overlooking the Foyle as long as they’re not disabled or have complex needs.” In terms of parking on Duke Street and Spencer Road, she said it has a one hour parking restriction and askedresidents would be expected to park after pm. The Ballyarnett Cllr suggested Clanmil needed to be educated. While acknowledging a “housing deficit”, she said, people need quality housing, a quality le, quality access and disabled people should have the same rights as everyone . A Clanmil representative said a range of accommodation is needed and people with complex needs are allocated houses by the Housing Executive. Refused Meanwhile, Sinn Feacutein Councillor Patricia Logue, said no distinction should be made between applicants and homes are allocated on a points-based system. “Those with the highest points are given first offer and refusal.” Disabled tenants may have carers who have to visit them three times a day. She warned that Clanmil could be taken to the Equality Commission over the scheme as some people need a car and can’t be treated dferently to those who don’t. Chair of the committee, Christopher Jackson, echoed her views saying those waiting years on homes shouldn’t have to choose between a home or their car. People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin voiced the need for housing but believes it has to be done right. He said: “Representatives are trying to create a more accessible city and district for those with disabilities.” He wasn’t convinced about the aesthetics of the building and insisted that the beautul riverfront must be regenerated appropriately. “It looks to me like a car parking facility, I don’t mean to insult the designer.” Picking up on Cllr Logue’s point about carers, DUP Alderman Hilary McClintock said people want letime homes but don’t know when their circumstances might change. Cllr Dobbins proposed that members do not accept the planning officers’ recommendation and refuse the application on grounds that it is contrary to access and movement and because of the design. “It does not allow people with disabilities to be included in a social housing scheme,” she concluded. Seven councillors voted in favour of her proposal, none against and there were four abstentions. The application was therefore refused. Afterwards a Clanmil spokesperson said: “Whilst we acknowledge the thinking of committee members, this city centre scheme could help address urgent housing need in the Waterside area. “This decision is therefore particularly bad news for families who desperately need a home. “We are considering the full range of options available to us and will decide on a way forward shortly.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Studies also show that children aged five and up from the poorest income groups are twice as likely to be obese compared to their more advantaged counterparts. Serena Terry from Elemental said they were pleased to be part of the project.“This is a really exciting project for us that has huge transferable potential.“Elemental’s roots are firmly embedded in the communities that benefit from our social prescribing technology, so to get the opportunity to combine the capabilities of our  with the success of the SWEET programme and create an innovative new app is an incredible opportunity for us.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

So,you are looking for a pun or two, you won’t be able to see any he... - dammit, let’s move on.The Invisible Man is a continuation of Hollywood’s new found love for reboots, with the classic novel by HG Wells first brought to the big screen back in , and this time we have Australian director Leigh Whannell taking the reins to give it a more modern touch.Whanell, who is attached to previous horror thriller block- busters such as Saw and Insidious as a writer, is well experienced in the genre, and from minute one, you know the film is in very good hands.The film tells the story of Cecilia, played by Elisabeth Moss.We are thrown straight into her unhappy world in an opening sequence that absolutely sets the tone for what is to come in terms of sheer tension.Cecilia has drugged her boyfriend Adrianinto a deep sleep in the early hours of the morning, and immediately sets about the process of getting the hell out of there.Which wouldnt be too dficult in a normal house, but a normal house it is not.She has to tread a gadget world obstacle course featuring security alarms, passwords and cameras in what I can only describe is a setting you would see in a Mission Impossible meets  type of film.Because it turns out, her boyfriend is a genius millionaire scientist control freak who has taken every precaution in an attempt to keep her in his clutches.After narrowly making her escape thanks to her sister Emily, Cecilia finally has some sort of freedom, but matters soon take a very strange turn. Shortly afterwards she is delivered the news that Adrian has killed himself by his lawyer brother, and that he has also left  million of his vast fortune to her. So hey, it’s not all bad.Except it is it’s very bad.Just when Cecilia believes her le is becoming a little bit rosier, events begin to spiral out of control in quite sinister ways. The oven suddenly goes on fire, her blanket is tossed around her bedroom, and she too ends up drugged. Adrian still very much has a pulse, and through his scientic and technical wizardy, he’s only gone and made himself invisible in a bid to make his ex’s le a living hell, with very tricks more brutal than the last. A new tinder account and going back on the market would have been less hassle, but, what do I know Now on paper, it all sounds a bit over the top, and in the hands of a lesser film maker I may have headed for the exit early.But this film delivers, for two reasons.Firstly, Whanell’s direction is flawless. He burrows into the quite effective horror trope of less is more, not resorting at all to endless jump scares that we see too often nowadays.His camera work excels in making the viewer completely uneasy throughout. There is one sequence where the camera is simply moving slowly from left to right while Cecila wanders the house alone during the night. Whanell plays with the audience superbly. He knows he has us in the palm of his hand. Where is Adrian  What will he do next Now in a role that requires the lead to portray terror, paranoia, rejection and abuse, Elisabeth Moss is outstanding.This is a film with very strong themes in some quarters it has been called the first big film of the #metoo movement in its representation of domestic abuse, and there is certainly symbols of that at dferent stages, with Moss carrying the flame in fine fashion as she attempts to defeat her own predator.She is utterly convincing in her despair as her world begins to fall apart from all angles, including one horrying turn of events that will have your jaw almost touching the floor - you have been warned. She shows all her acting props that were also on display in the hugely popular Handmaids Tale series.So,you’re a weirdo like myself and enjoy being disturbed and uncomfortable for two hours or so, then ‘The Invisible Man’ will be money well spent.Hey, we might even get a sequel, although, given the films climax, ‘I canny see that’ happening.I’ll stop now.The Invisible Man is now showing at Brunswick Moviebowl. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Maghera native Peter Donnelly was in charge of the : flight from Manchester which touched down in Belfast City Airport around midnight. The delay followed a frantic period of negotiation as Peter attempted to ensure he got his passengers back to Belfast. He told Derry Now: “It was the last of four flights I had done yesterday. “It was quite subdued because most of the passengers were on social media and already had heard rumours and ious bits and pieces, which I hadn’t heard myself. googletag.cmd.push “When you’re flying, it’s all-consuming. You don’t have time to be looking at social media – there’s a job to be done. “For two hours, I was constantly on the phone back and forth to the ious authorities. “I was hopeful and then some of the guys at the airport dashed that, saying they were impounding the plane. But I stayed focused and we eventually got the news we wanted.” At the time, Peter was unaware of the flight’s signicance as Flybe’s last, but he took time today to reflect on the impact the airline has had, particularly on Belfast City Airport. googletag.cmd.push He said: “It’s a letime for me – I’ve been there  years. It’s more of a family than just a job. “It will be a massive blow. I know a lot of the staff at the airport and watched it grow from a couple of tin shacks to what it is today. “It’s a lovely wee compact airport and it’s modern but it was Nissen huts in  when I started. At the centre of the south Derry man’s thinking was passenger welfare, so much so that the plane was further delayed to allow a group of workers coming from Aberdeen to board. “We were all ready to go and we got a call saying Aberdeen was inbound with seven guys from the rigs. “Those guys were depending on us to get home, so we waited and got them on board. A lot of people were relying on Flybe to get to and from their jobs.” Peter admits it is a concerning time for all staff at the airline and revealed that getting any form of payment from the company could be dficult. He said: “We won’t get any form of payment from the company because it’s gone into administration. Any pay that’s owed, we won’t get that. “Maybe down the line there will be some form of payment, but there’s nothing we can use to pay our bills.” The pilot, who flies hot air balloons in his spare time, has planned to get the staff together at a later stage to try and keep spirits up, but in the meantime has received a unique job offer. “On a positive note, a friend rang me to tell me he needed a shepherd to look after his sheep on the Glenshane and askedI was available. “I said ‘sure, I’ll take anything!’. That’s my first job offer and it’s not even  hours yet.” “I’m glad we stayed with the process and got everyone back home. At least that’s some consolation.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Reynolds has watched several players leave the Blues in the past two seasons and he feels he knows the challenges facing Devine this season.“To come from behind and beat a good team like Derry who finished fourth last year, were thrilled with that,” he said. “You can see with Decky, he is in the same situation I was in last year – hes lost a lot of his main players, his top players, and hes rebuilding and its going to take time and its exactly the way I was with it last year, and again this year. Were still delighted to beat them because they are a fantastic club. I have a lot of time for the lads and I had a good time up there, so to beat Derry City at any time is great.”Waterford picked up their first home win at the third attempt thanks to a wonder goal from Shane Grfin, but Reynolds admitted he did not see the victory coming.“We were - down against a really good side,” he continued. “I didnt see it coming and I thoughtanyone was going to score in the second half it was Derry. They are a really good footballing team and we are delighted to beat them. We were on the receiving end of it last year, losing to them a few times, so were delighted to win against a really good side.“They were fantastic goals from young footballers who were given their chance here. They are thrilled with it. It is all in their learning and they need to improve but they are working hard on the training ground. Ive seen them and others work on their finishing and you reap your rewards.”Waterford were the more threatening team throughout Fridays game and looked the more likely to win the game, especially in the closing stages.“Im not so sure,” Reynolds countered. “I thought they had a spell whereanyone was going to win it in the second half it was them. It took a wonder strike. Even though we had a lot of good chances, they had a lot of possession, even though they werent really hurting us. We defended really well and you always have to do that, but Decky is rebuilding a team. Its very dficult. It will take time.”Waterford have now devastated Derry City with late goals on two of their last three visits to the RSC, taking four points in the process, and Reynolds admitted that there is rarely a dull moment when the teams meet.“It was a wonder strike but I think we were here on another day and Darren Cole scores a wonder goal,” he said. “We have been on the receiving end – weve lost in extra time up there in a cup as well. They have great people up there, and it will take time and Im delighted to beat them.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At , the long-time proprietor of a Pennyburn sports shop is a le-affirming example to others of how to live a meaningful le after sporting retirement, thanks to the enduring power of friendship.  He pulls up the metal shutters of the shop and fights with the key as it struggles to unlock the door.It’s a short trip from home to his premises in Pennyburn but it’s a well-trodden path for a man now in his s.With a local paper snuggly secured under his armpit he’s made this journey in rain, hail and shine. Through good times and bad.It’s the same old routine every morning, one well-rehearsed over  years of business. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED: Jobby’s Sports Centre opened in the late s after he bought it from his friend Raymond Daly. I was entering a business I knew something about,’ Jobby says now. Picture: Tom Heaney  But this is no ordinary shop, and this is no ordinary shopkeeper.John Hume can probably hold claim to be Derry’s most famous living citizen. But without any shadow of a doubt, the Maiden City’s most famous sporting son is John ‘Jobby’ Crossan.Crossan needs no introduction in these parts, but for the benefit of the uninitiated ‘Jobby’ Crossan was born in  at Hamilton Street in Derry.A precocious talent Crossan played as an inside forwardfor his hometown team, Derry City. His performances quickly garnered the attention of the top scouts from England, where thespoke of the -year-old wonder boy of Irish soccer … Irelands Jimmy Greaves. In August  he joined Sparta Rotterdam, before making his debut for Ireland against England at Wembley. But more of that game later.Crossan joined Standard Liegravege in , playing for the Belgian side in a European Cup semi-final against Real Madrid.Ian Rush may have famously described playing in Italy like being in a foreign country, but the Derry man negotiated this precarious new le abroad with all the sure-footedness of a mountain goat. googletag.cmd.push  PICTURED:Fully focused: team captain Crossan leads out Manchester City, a club he joined after a successful spell at Sunderland. He moved on to Middlebrough in .  “It was great,” he enthused. “I thoroughly enjoyed it. I might have been lucky as a player but obviously I could play a wee bit. We learned a couple of languages and things. We were fortunate because we were winning matches, playing for trophies. Played against the top teams. We played Real Madrid in the semi-final of the  European Cup. We beat Rangers in the quarter-finals and I happened to get two goals.”In September  he moved to Sunderland, the start of a successful eight-year spell in England that also took him to Manchester Cityand Middlesbrough.In a European Championship qualier against Poland he scored one of the finest goals that Windsor Park has ever witnessed, a spectacular and acrobatic volley from  yards. And in a World Cup preliminary game Crossan scored three against Albania.He retired from the professional game in .But this isn’t a feature about a footballer, a special talent, a shopkeeper. That tale has been told before.This is a story about something more important than that.This is a story of friendship.Upon retirement Crossan faced the same dilemma as most professional sportsmen – how to fill the void.“Your whole world changes and you have to find something to fill that hole,” he explains. “I decided to come back home to Derry.”  PICTURED:Jobby Crossan in his Sunderland days. He was a prolic striker, scoring  goals in his  appearnces for the club between  and . That particular hole in his le was filled by a sports shop in Pennyburn he bought in the late s.“I bought the shop from a friend of mine, Raymond Daly. I thought I knew a bit about sport and this might do. I was entering a business I knew something about.” Jobby’s Sports Centre was born.You think of Barcelona’s great club motto – Meacutes que unclub . Well Jobby’s became more than a shop.Almost from its inception the place became a magnet for friends – old and new – to congregate to chat about football, to hotly debate, to blether, but above all  to laugh.This has been the case for over four decades now, and, like the proprietor himself, shows little sign of slowing down. Not dissimilar to the barber shop scenes in Coming To America, the cast in Jobby’s Sports Centre ies from day to day. But it never empties.Joe Quigg, Roger ODoherty, Donal Ferry, Bobby Ross were all in attendance on this particular wet and windy Monday morning.Charlie Johnstone calls, as does Wee Black Joe Doherty, Harry Nelis and Noel Crampsie.Joe Doherty comes down from Strabane to chew the fat on all matters cricket related.On Thursdays Jimmy Blair, an old friend from Jobby’s playing days, Harry O’Kane and Alfie Taylor make the trek up from Coleraine without fail.Sometimes there aren’t enough chairs to go round and the host perches himself on a low hanging shelf, when he’s not ferrying tea back and forth.  PICTURED: Old friends: Jobby Crossan catches up with another well-known local football figure Gerry Doherty. They huddle around a gas heater that owes them nothing, swapping stories, slagging, telling tall tales – all cloaked with that quintessentially Derry sense of humour, based on familiarity and gentle ribbing.“These boys would come into the shop and I thought they’d keep me on the straight and narrow. Turns out they just kept me on the narrow, and drank all my tea,” explains the host. “I go through three kettles a year!”Stories abound of local players, local teams, past and present. Their love of the game still undimmed, and the warmth among this band of brothers is evident.Football connects people. And sometimes those connections last a letime.Jobby, of course, has encountered more than most.“I’ve met three kings. The Swedish, Belgian and Norwegian Kings,” insists Crossan, very matter-of-factly.In , before his debut for Northern Ireland against England, he met Field Marshall Montgomery at Wembley.Crossan re-tells the occasion with a photographic recall.“You’re from my neck of the woods old spud ” says Crossan in a posh English accent to the mirth of his companions.“Nearby” replied Jobby. “You’re from Moville and I’m from Derry.”“Very good,” came back Montgomery, “Have a good game!”, again to enthusiastic laughter.“But that’s how it is in football. You run round making friends, and there was I from the Brandywell in Derry rubbing shoulders with a World War  general.”Jobby, of course, became great friends with George Best and the Derry man has nothing but fond memories of his old Manchester housemate and international team-mate.“Not for publication!” he says with a glint in his eye when asked did he have any stories he’d like to share.“George was one of the greats. There were good players about like Pele and Di Stefano, but George played in a league where they would kicks lumps out you. Players went out to nail him. But George was unique, a class of his own. He was more or less reared in my house in Manchester. We never got peace. One Friday afternoon we had two Miss Worlds in.”“George had them both!” jumps in Donal Ferry, again to roars of laughter.  PICTURED: Jobby pictured with manager Joe Mercer and his Manchester City teammates The bond between friends get much stronger with age, according to a recent study from the University of Michigan. Friendships play a key role in health and happiness – especially as we get older.The study wasn’t written about Jobby Crossan and his friends in the shop, but it might as well have been.Former East Stirling and Derry City player Bobby Ross would be the longest serving attendee at Jobby’s.Indeed, the two veterans had been playing in a weekly five-aside game at the Templemore Complex up until last year when a locked cartilage finally brought an end to the great man’s career at the age of .“Cut short in my prime!” Jobby quips, only half joking and ever the competitor.“I’ve been coming in here from the start,” says his friend Bobby in a soft Scottish accent that hasn’t left him despite living in these shores as long as the shop has been open.“Sure, I’ve nothing  to bloody well do!”“No, the craic’s good,” he continues, “the craic’s always very good in here. It soon passes an hour or two and you can get tea and coffee any time. And you might get an odd bun!”In a final poignant moment he confesses: “No, I’d be lost without it to tell you the truth.”Bobby Ross seems to speak for them all when he says these words.At the close of business, the gas heater is switched off, the lights dimmed and the shutter comes down once more.The front door key still refuses to play ball, especially in these dark nights, before it finally turns in the lock.But this is far from daily drudgery, it’s a labour of love.In the sweetness of friendship let there be conversation and laughter, for in the dew of the morning that is where the heart is refreshed and stays forever young.Jobby’s Sports Centre – more than a shop.

With her fresh complexion, sparkling eyes and ready smile, few would believe that Mrs Jean Kelly is  years old.Secretly enjoying the fuss, Jean appeared happy to be sipping tea from a bone china teacup and saucer at her birthday party, which was attended by family, friends and staff members.While Jean grew up in the Roaring Twenties, it wasnrsquot all flappers and jazz bands around Lisowen mdash the townland outside Saintfield which was her home.Born Jean Stewart, she lived with her grandparents and attended Doranrsquos Rock National School, a small two-room country school between Saintfield and Crossgar.When she left school she went to work at the Montalto Estate in Ballynahinch, which was owned by the aristocratic Clanwilliam family.Youngest son Malcolm takes up her story.He said: ldquoIt wasnrsquot long after she began working there when one fine evening she was pushing her bike along the Creevyargon Road toward home, exhausted after a dayrsquos work when she met a young man walking toward her in the other direction.Malcolm explained the young man was so taken by Jean that he offered to push the bike for her.ldquoThe young man was my father, Hugh, and within three years they were married, said Malcolm.Hughrsquos family were dairy farmers from the Creevyargon Road. When the couple got married Jean gave up her job at Montalto, as was customary in those days.Jean and Hugh were to be blessed with six children, three of whom mdash Malcolm and his elder sisters, Irene and Anne mdash are still alive. Two of the children died in infancy and another daughter, Margaret, passed away a few years ago.Jean has been a widow for over  years but her fabulous tapestries and hours spent volunteering at local charity shops are testimony to someone who enjoys being busy.

It is beyond time that we invested in this important part of our economy, creating new jobs and bringing new opportunities to local people.Cllr Curran mdash who invited Mr Poots to visit Ardglass to see the port at first hand mdash said such a visit would provide an opportunity for the fisheries minister to see that the development of the harbour is ldquoessential for the day-to-day lives of people in the village and the economic prosperity of South Down.He said that the local port is home to a large fishing fleet which lands some of the largest quantities of prawns in Ireland. In addition, Cllr Curran explained that Ardglass is the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor.ldquoThe main economic activity in Ardglass is the fishing industry and although it is reasonable buoyant at present, harbour improvement is needed to sustain it., Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThis improvement is required to facilitate the large fish and prawn boats as they have encountered issues with access.Cllr Curran explained that due to their size, a number of vessels have scraped along the sea bed at low tides entering the harbour, causing damage to their hulls which can result in vessels being out of commission for repairs. leading to a loss of earnings.ldquoSome of the larger boats now bypass Ardglass and go where, mainly to Belfast, he continued. ldquoThis results in a loss of landings and additional transport costs to the local fish factories.Cllr Curran added: ldquoIf Ardglass harbour is not deepened, it could potentially lead to an economic collapse for the fishing industry in Ardglass and that is something no one wants to see happening.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is supporting plans to regenerate Ardglass harbour to help secure the future of the villagersquos fishing industry and has provided financial support to a harbour development group which has drawn up a series of proposals.The money was designed to help the group complete a business case aimed at paving the way for a number of projects including deepening the harbour to accommodate larger herring and mackerel vessels and to upgrade berthing facilities for local trawlers.The Ardglass group is also keen to relocate trawlers to the an area known locally as the Saw Pit at the harbour which it wants to deepen in order that vessels are able to put to sea when they want and not have to wait on the right tidal conditions.The provision of a dedicated repair facility for vessels is also a key aim for the new group as currently trawler skippers have to take their boats to Kilkeel or Portavogie which reduces the time they can spend at sea earning a living.Another key plank of the grouprsquos vision for the future is converting property at the harbour to provide a new hub offering essential office and training space. It is also hoped to provide a storage and work area and space for the community to use..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th March 2020 Coronavirus.jpg","title":"Coronavirus: St Patrick’s parade off  ","story":"NEXT Tuesdayrsquos St Patrickrsquos Day parade in Downpatrick has been cancelled over the coronavirus threat.Itrsquos only the second time the cross-community carnival has been halted since it was started in the s mdash it was called off in  due to the foot and mouth health crisis.Newry, Mourne and Down Council yesterday confirmed that parades would not go ahead in Downpatrick or Newry after party leaders on the council decided to pull the plug.The council has also cancelled open-air activities in St Patrickrsquos Square, but other events in Down County Museum and Down Arts Centre are going ahead.Chief executive Marie Ward spoke yesterday morning with the DUPrsquos Billy Walker, Sinn Feinrsquos Willie Clarke, UUPrsquos David Taylor and the SDLPrsquos Pete Byrne for their views after Belfast City Council voted to cancel its parade on Monday night.Dublin also cancelled its St Patrickrsquos Day parade, the largest event held on the island.A council spokesperson said the decision was made ldquoin consultation with party leaders and is in line with the recent cancellations of St Patrickrsquos Day parades where.The spokesperson added: ldquoThe council appreciates the negative impact this decision may have on local businesses at this time, however this decision has been taken as a precaution given our membersrsquo and the publicrsquos concern around the coronavirus response.The townrsquos religious ceremonies are to go ahead as planned.A service of Holy Communion in St Patrickrsquos Church of Ireland Church at Saul will be held at .am.The traditional mass in Irish and the distribution of shamrock will take place in St Patrickrsquos Church at am and the cross-community service will take place in Down Cathedral at .am.The Dean of Down, the Very Rev Henry Hull, said while he understood peoplersquos concerns, he pointed out that Patrickrsquos Day was also a religious festival and that services would be taking place as normal.ldquoPart of our theme this year is prayer for the country which is very apt at this time, he added.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke was the first politician to call for the event to be cancelled.The Sinn Feacutein man said it was ldquoessential to have an all Ireland response to this epidemic, which is spreading rapidly across Europe.He said: ldquoI believe there is an obligation on myself and all councillors to protect the health and well-being of citizens, given the spread of coronavirus and growing concern amongst the public.He said that the decision was not taken lightly but it was ldquothe responsible thing to do.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoI would like to see an event held at a later dateit is possible, to reschedule these celebrations, as sections of the business community will undoubtedly see a reduction in business, and the British government need to provide resources to mitigate these losses.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker said he felt that there would have been an increased risk to Downpatrickthe parade had have gone ahead as it could have attracted people who normally attended the Belfast event.ldquoWe may have had the situation that we would have increased crowds with increased risk, said Cllr Walker.ldquoI think itrsquos the right decision to take. I completely sympathise with all the council officials and employees who have planned the event, and of course all the community groups who love to take part and who have put in months of hard work with float and costume preparation.ldquoBut at the end of the day we have to think of health and public safety.Council vice-chairman Terry Andrews, of the SDLP, said he fully supported the decision but added ldquothat it was most unfortunate it had to be taken.ldquoCouncillors have done the right thing and itrsquos better to be cautious to minimise any potential risks, he said.South Down MP Chris Hazzard praised the council for its ldquoproactive and responsible leadership to protect our citizens in cancelling the parade.He added: ldquoThere will of course be huge public disappointment and hard-felt financial repercussions for our local retail and hospitality industry. But the health and well-being of our citizens must be the priority for all of us.One of the first associated casualties of the cancelled parade is Downpatrick and County Down Railwayrsquos planned park-and-ride service from Inch Abby to the town centre.Railway chairman Robert Gardiner said he estimated the not-for profit organisation would lose between pound,-pound, in income as a result.ldquoIf therersquos no carnival, therersquos no need for the park and ride, confirmed Mr Gardiner. ldquoWe normally carry about - people into Downpatrick on the day and they nearly all go to the carnival.ldquoWhile we can take this loss of income on the chin at the moment, we would be worriedthis continues as Easter is a very good holiday for us and we enjoyed a very busy summer last year..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/11th March 2020 Crossgar.jpg","title":"Crossgar hosts meeting on future of unionism  ","story":"THE first in a series of meetings to discuss the future of unionism in Rowallane was held last week in Crossgar.Guests included Lagan Valley MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, Orange Order Grand Secretary the Rev Mervyn Gibson and victimsrsquo campaigner Sammy Heenan.Organised by Rowallane councillors Kathryn Owen and Billy Walker, Crossgar Orange Order members and Crossgar Young Defenders Flute Band, last weekrsquos meeting has been hailed a great success.Around  people attended the meeting at Crossgar Orange Hall with plans confirmed for another in Saintfield over the coming weeks.Organisers say that they believe that local unionism is in a ldquomuch stronger place following the meeting with organisers thanking all those who took part.Also attending last weekrsquos meeting was Mr John Hanna, chairman of the UUPrsquos Strangfordrsquos Association.Cllr Owen said people spoke ldquoopenly and honestly during the meeting, with concerns voiced by those who attended ldquolistened to and discussed.She admitted while there is work to do across Northern Ireland, she is confident that unionism in Rowallane has taken a step in the right direction.Cllr Walker mdash who described the meeting as ldquoextremely worthwhile mdash thanked everyone who supported the event and encouraged people to attend the next one in Rowallane when the date and venue have been confirmed.ldquoThe turnout was tremendous and there was a lot of rank discussion which is good.

Monday when local politicians agreed to appoint a dedicated design team to oversee major redevelopment work at the sprawling park which covers over , acres.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which is working to make the forest park one of Northern Irelandrsquos leading tourist attractions mdash has to date secured almost pound, in grant aid towards the cost of the ambitious project.The council has also committed just over poundm of its money to the project with a fresh application for pound.m to be submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund in June, with an anxious wait until September to discover whether the bid has been successful.The funding secured to date has been provided by the Heritage Lottery Fundand Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs .Since the s, the sprawling forest park was the demesne of the Annesley family, who created a beautul landscape and a nationally and internationally important -hectare arboretum.The proposed development project aims to create a new vision for the historic Castlewellan demesne, delivering what is being described as a ldquoheritage-led destination to connect people with their built and natural heritage.Council officials and local politicians are keen to see the picturesque forest parkrsquos Arboretum, Annesley Garden and Grange Buildings redeveloped to help increase the number of visitors and provide the area with an economic boost.Officials say the focus is on improving amenities and the interpretation of the parkrsquos natural and built heritage.A recent economic appraisal recommended the development of what is being described as a welcome centre in the walled garden area designed to provide access via a lt to its upper floor, with the council keen to play a leading role, alongside the Forest Service, to help transform the parkrsquos fortunes and make it even more popular.At Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee, it was confirmed that the council currently holds a -year operating licence for the parkrsquos walking, bike and horse riding trails, in addition to play facilities.In addition, politicians were told that during a workshop in January to discuss the way forward, it was identied that formal links will be required with a number of organisations in relation to the future management of the parkrsquos Bothy

Two previous consultation exercises have already been held.Councillors were told on Monday that the local authority may be asked to provide additional funding for the forest park development,the level of funding being sought from the Heritage Lottery Fund is not secured.They also agreed to investigate the potential of developing a partnership arrangement with Annes Grove in Cork which boasts an th century house and early th century garden, the latter of which includes a woodland garden with an interesting collection of rhododendrons, river garden, walled garden, wild-flower meadow and lily

ends Strangford cup dream  ","story":"THERE was to be no fairytale cup ending for Strangford when Ballynagross ruled the roost in Friday nightrsquos NFU Mutual Harry Clarke Cup semi-final at Bignian Park.Philip Campbellrsquos side displayed a ruthless streak when they brushed aside their giantkilling neighbours to book their place in the Easter Monday showdown for the third year in a row and they can now prepare for a massive derby clash with Celtic Bhoys.First half goals from twin terrors Daniel Taggart and Declan Dowie sent Ballynagross on their way and Eoin Rooney smashed in an unstoppable third midway through the second half to finally kill off a game Strangford side.In a competitive opening, Ballynagross used the width of the pitch to get at Strangford and with just two minutes gone Dowie had an effort cleared off the line after a cross from Rooney threatened to cause damage.Five minutes later Rooney had an effort hacked away to safety by an alert Conan Hynds as Ballynagross threatened to run riot.However, Donnie Ritchie started to get a few tackles in and his physicality in the engine room enabled Strangford to mount a few attacks of their own, using Conall Magee and Eoin King as willing outlets.Darting runs from Hynds and Ritchiersquos no-nonsense approach was just the ticket for Strangford and with  minutes gone Patrick Kerr had the ball in the back of the net only for it to be harshly ruled out for offside.Two minutes later at the opposite end, Cultra again saved from Rooney and followed that up with another good stop to deny Dowie.Strangford were becoming increasingly confident as teenage defenders Fionn McFaul and Thomas Fitzsimons settled into the job and with Ritchie and Hynds rattling a few cages, Niall Hyndsrsquo side started to look the part.However, they were left crestfallen in the th minute when Dowie broke free on the right and crossed for Taggart to flash a ing header into the net, somewhat against the run of play.It was a cruel blow for Strangford, but things were about to get worse, much worse.Referee Aide Sharvin who had a good game, had the whistle in his mouth to blow for half-time when the influential Connor McCarron sent Dowie clear and with the Strangford back four caught flat-footed, he lobbed the ball over Cultra with the last kick of the half to make it -.Strangford knew they had no choice but to throw caution to the wind after the break and that they did, but Aaron Beattie and Conor Marron gave absolutely nothing away at the back for Ballynagross and chances were hard to come by.Ballynagross were now able to hit Strangford on the break and with  minutes gone Cultra pulled off a stunning save to deny the overlapping Tom McNeill and then John Shields on the follow-up.With  minutes gone King blasted wildly over the top for Strangford before Ballynagross were denied what looked a stonewall penalty when Cultra emptied Rooney as he darted into the penalty box, but the referee waved play on.Ballynagross were not to be denied their third goal and with  minutes gone Shields played a delightful ball into the path of Rooney and from the right hand side of the box he unleashed a vicious volley that had goal written all over it from the moment it left his boot.Strangford still refused to throw in the towel and apart from a double save from close in by Cathail Arnold, they never really threatened, despite seeing their fair share of possession.Ballynagross could have won by a bigger margin, but Cultra stood big and tall and kept the final tally down with several more good saves.Ballynagross: Cathail Arnold, Tom McNeill, Deaglan Craig, Connor Marron, Aaron Beattie, Conor McCarron, Cormac Byrne, John Shields, Daniel Taggart, Eoin Rooney, Declan Dowie.

Please try again later.Submitting...His report will be published at pm on Friday. Sir Patrick will make a public statement, but will not be taking questions from journalists.Initially Sir Patrick did not appear to want to partake in a widespread ‘representations process’ – or ‘Maxwellisation’ as it is also known – because it inevitably delays the end of a public inquiry. In the case of Sir John Chilcot’s inquiry into the Iraq War, the Maxwellisation process led to widespread public and political criticism after the report was delayed more than five years between the final oral evidence and the publication of the report.In the final week of oral inquiry hearings in December , Sir Patrick said that he did not intend to send routine Maxwellisation letters, saying: “I am not in favour of a routine Maxwellisation – it takes up too much time and as this is a public inquiry, expenditure has to be seen [to be] justied for the public.”However, that position changed last year in what some sources say was an attempt to head off the possibility of any witness attempting to judicially review the inquiry.On the final day of inquiry hearings in December , Sir Patrick warned that it is “very likely that some iniduals and or bodies may be subject to quite signicant criticism in light of actions or omissions relating to the scheme” but he stressed his “complete determination” to ensure that no one is “treated unfairly”.Since it was set up more than three years ago, the inquiry has issued  notices under the sweeping powers of Section  of the Inquiries Act  which allow it to compel answers from witnesses and forces them to turn over evidence relevant to RHI. That process has seen the inquiry accumulate a vast pile of . million pages of evidence. At its height, the inquiry team had  members including the chairman and  members.The total bill for the inquiry itself is expected to be published tomorrow. However, by last year the full bill for taxpayers – taking in the fact that witnesses’ legal costs were overwhelmingly publicly funded – was already more than £ million, and has risen since then.\"\" for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from Belfast News LetterSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg bZbGUI\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-gtfDJT hQGsjX\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Natural Resources Wales and the Welsh Assembly should not ignore the issue this time around.Responding to public concerns about the new plans, a spokesman for the Welsh Government said: ldquoIf EDF Energy submits a formal application, Natural Resources Wales will carry out a thorough assessment of the proposed activity before making a determination, having regard to the need to protect the environment and human health, as required by the Marine and Coastal Access Act .ldquoI know many constituents are very worried, said Stephen Doughty MP for Cardf South and Penarth.ldquoWe shouldnrsquot be a dumping ground for others, and I will continue to raise concerns on behalf of residents and report back any information I receive.To comment on the proposed sample plan, visit NRWrsquos consultation page before Wednesday, March  at: naturalresources.wales permits-and-permissions permit-applications-consultations-and-decisions current-consultations-marine-licence-applicantions hinkley-point-c-sediment-sampling-plan-sp  langen article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It was Captain Robertrsquos who did it.Mr Davies spent time conducting research in Bilbao, Durango, Gernika, and Alicante where he consulted Spanish historians and met with descendants of those involved in the civil war.Outwitting Franco: The Welsh Maritime Heroes of the Spanish Civil War can be purchased on Amazon for pound in paperback.Alternatively, it can be purchased digitally for pound on Kindle. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Mrs Thompson is personally committed to creating a culture of enthusiasm for reading and said that she enjoyed seeing children becoming readers and getting ldquohooked on books.ldquoTo be able to read opens all education to our children, she continued.ldquoResearch is forever reporting that a child who is read to or who reads for pleasure will become a success.The schoolrsquos library holds an extensive collection of literature and each term a portion of the school budget is allocated for the purchase of books.On World Book Day, the owner of Grfin Books, Mel Grfin, will bring a pop-up book shop to Dinas Powys Primary where children can buy a book for pound.The school also participates in eCalm in collaboration with Dinas Powys Library, meaning that every child is a member.The school has its own student council, Pupil Voice, which is active on both sites.The Eco Committee recently introduced an Eco Bear to encourage all pupils to be eco-friendly and this year the school had its Platinum Status renewed by Eco Schools.The school has invested heavily in Lego resources and iPads and has received grant funding from Dow Corning supporting this investment in promoting science, technology, engineering, and mathematics .As part of its commitment to the importance of STEM, the school participates in the National Primary Maths Challenge.Two students from Dinas Powys Primary have reached the Bonus Round in this yearrsquos challenge.The school has achieved the Cymraeg Campus Bronze Award Charter that commends its commitment to the Welsh language and culture.Strong links with outside agencies include CAVMS music tuition and JAFFA Club.Last November, students from Dinas Powys Primary School performed Shakespearersquos The Tempest at The Riverfront Theatre, Newport, as part of the Shakespeare Schools Foundation.They also sang at St Davidrsquos Hall with the Cardf and Vale Christmas Showcase Cluster Choir in December.The schoolrsquos two dance squads will shortly be performing at Barry Memorial Hall for Best Foot Forward on Wednesday, March .For more information on the school, visit dinaspowysps article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Of those who received the benefit,  per cent were unemployed.Universal Credit began in  and has been gradually rolled out across the country. It was designed to simply the benefits system for working age people by merging six separate benefits into one payment.But features such as the -week wait, the -child limit and the benefits cap, as well as public spending cuts, have been associated with a rise in rent arrears, food bank usage and child poverty.Local homelessness charity, Llamau, has expressed concern for young people who are being enrolled on the scheme.Joe Payne, head of vale services and family mediation for Llamau, said: ldquoPrior to the introduction of Universal Credit, a young person may have claimed Job Seekers Allowance or Employment Support Allowance but this is no longer an option.ldquoUndoubtedly, the five week waiting time and a very low National Minimum Wage for people under  is going to cause young people untold hardship and in a lot of cases, spiralling debt.A Department for Work and Pension spokesman said the increase in  to -year olds claiming Universal Credit is lsquoin line with expectationsrsquo as it has been rolled out to every job centre.Jane Hutt, AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, said: ldquoI am concerned at the rise in the number of claimants, particularly young people, who need to access Universal Credit.ldquoCare leavers in particular are being disadvantaged by the changes. I do not believe the concerns that have been raised by claimants, by employers and by organisations advising and supporting people affected, including those who are in employment, have been addressed and I will continue to raise them on behalf of my constituents.The government has committed to ending a four-year benefit freeze in April this year, meaning millions of people will see their payments rise by the same rate as inflation.Councillor Kathryn McCaffer, Vale of Glamorgan Council youth champion, said: ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council is working with a range of partners to mitigate any adverse impacts and offer a iety of support to young people in financial dficulties. Those classed as Not in Education, Employment or Trainingcan access the Inspire  Work programme, which provides financial help to pay for the likes of work clothes, training and travel costs.ldquoVulnerable tenants are protected from debt through the direct payments system. Currently around  per cent of tenants have this system in place, which allows a portion of Universal Credit payments to be made directly to the council to cover rent.ldquoThis year, the council has been able to secure over pound, of additional income for tenants by helping them secure backdated claims, ensuring the correct benefits are being received, assisting with appeals, and helping secure the best tarfs for utilities. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

How do those people then stay, snuggled in snoozy paradise for hour upon hour until their alarm gives them a nudge and they arise rested and ready for a new day  I have never been a good sleeper, even as a child. If anything at all is playing on my mind, I never lose my appetite, but I will lose slumber. I have friends who similarly suffer. I use the word suffer quite deliberately, because lying there in the dark at am it can feel like everyone  is snuffling softly but for the wide-awake person, it can feel horrendous. As the time ticks closer to the alarm and still sleep will not come, it can feel quite anxiety-inducing and so the vicious circle whizzes, fizzes and flies through your brain making sleep feel further and further away.But, as this is a lelong way of living for me and I am overwhelmingly a lsquocrack on kinda womanrsquo, I have developed ways to use this time effectively. I listen to podcasts, and have learned about biohacking, how broccoli defends itself and the many twists and turns of the Brexit negotiations whilst the street snoozes. I catch up with messages . I also think a lot. I just lay there in the dark and puzzle though story ideas, events from the day and issues facing friends, family and myself. In a twisted way, this time and opportunity has become quite precious to me. I donrsquot know when  in the day Irsquod have the time and space to just ponder, muse, consider and percolate. It is during this time that I have considered my earlier point about jealousy. None of us know what is going on behind the closed door of either someonersquos home or their mind and whilst I hope you sleep well,you canrsquot, use that time wisely to think, to empathise and to learn. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Rather than adhering to a nationally prescribed learning program, schools and practitioners will be able to make decisions that best meet the needs of specic learners.As well as contributing to the framework, St Josephrsquos has also introduced their own bespoke curriculum, and is one of only  Curriculum Innovation Schools in Wales.The St Josephrsquos curriculum is based on findings in child development and cognitive science, with staff undertaking extensive learning on how childrenrsquos bodies and minds develop.Lessons have been designed to enhance pupilsrsquo personal, social and physical development, whilst also providing a detailed knowledge and understanding of the world, both past and present.The school has also benefitted from signicant on-site works, including the refurbishment of all classrooms, a complete reconfiguration of the Foundation Phase learning spaces and a state of the art new-build Nursery.Staff regularly deliver learning experiences outside of the classroom, as the schoolrsquos grounds include a playing field, wooded area, pond, orchard, wildflower meadow and polytunnel.The implementation of the schoolrsquos ambitious curriculum has seen standards improve year on year. Last yearrsquos National Reading Tests saw the average child in St Josephrsquos score within the top  percent of the country, with similarly high standards achieved in mathematics.Headteacher, Gareth Rein said: ldquoWersquore extremely proud of our achievements at St Josephrsquos. Everything we do is based on the best available research and is designed to help each inidual child thrive.Cabinet Member for Education and Regeneration, Councillor Lis Burnett, said: ldquoThe new Curriculum for Wales is inspiring schools to take a more holistic approach toward learning. It encourages them to focus more on how and why the curriculum is being delivered, rather than delivering specic content and academic results.ldquoSt Josephrsquos have done a brilliant job in helping craft this approach, and in turn have seen their own curriculum and learning practices blossom.St Josephrsquos will be hosting an open day on Wednesday March .

The short list of potential locations for e-bike stations includes Penarth Town Centre, Cogan Train Centre, Penarth Train Station, Llandough Hospital, The Esplanade, Cosmeston Country Park, Cardf Bay Barrage, and Pont-y-Werin Bridge.The scheme hopes to encourage people to switch from their daily car journey to e-bikes, saving on average g of CO for every  kilometre travelled.The average round trip from Penarth to Cardf is km, which would save ,g of COused daily.Nextbike Managing Director, Krysia Solheim, said the Penarth scheme would be great for those who commute into the capital.ldquoWe know from our research that a lot of commuters already cycle from Penarth into Cardf, said Ms Solheim.ldquoE-bikes will make that journey easier and quicker than ever before, which will hopefully persuade more people to switch from four wheels to two on a daily basis. Picking up an e-bike instead of jumping in the car is also a great way for people to reduce their own personal carbon footprints to help our communities tackle climate change.ldquoPenarth will play an important part in leading the bike share revolution in Wales - itrsquos an exciting time - and we want the community to be as involved as possible.\"Councillor Peter King, Cabinet Member for Neighbourhood Services and Transport, said: ldquoFeedback from the Nextbike consultation was overwhelmingly positive, with many residents hoping to see the expansion of the scheme to the wider Vale.ldquoHaving declared a climate emergency last year, and having recently proposed a pound.m investment into tackling environmental issues, the Nextbike scheme will be a leading example of our commitment to tackling climate change and improving the wellbeing of our residents. We hope this will inspire the launch of similar schemes in future.The Nextbike project is being funded by Section  sustainable transport contributions. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Victims are regularly kept updated on progress of investigations.ldquoWe are dedicated to making our communities even safer by preventing and reducing crime and building on our success in solving crime and seeking justice for victims.ldquoCompared to similar forces in the UK, South Wales Police is the best performing force on recorded crime and there is a  per cent lower chance of being a victim of crime in South Wales than where.ldquoThere was a  per cent year-on-year reduction in burglaries in the Bridgend and Vale of Glamorgan area, where people are far less likely to become a victim of burglary than where in South Wales. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

But I do believe that as citizens in a democracy, it is important to have an idea about what is going on becausewe always turn a blind eye, eventually I fear, we might stop seeing anything at all. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_MM-Photo-1.jpg","title":"manufacturing month ni to showcase strength of sector","story":"Posted on Tuesday  January  by Ulster Business Economy Minister Diane Doods with Manufacturing NIs Stephen Kelly Northern Ireland’s burgeoning manufacturing sector will be showcased as part of a major initiative to highlight the strength and excellence of the industry here. Manufacturing Month NI, led by Manufacturing NI, will run for the entire month of March. It will include a series of events, business breakfasts, seminars, workplace tours, and the flagship annual Anchor High leadership summit will be held across Northern Ireland to highlight local manufacturing success stories, address major challenges as we enter the new decade, and inspire the next generation of manufacturers and engineers.

The revamp is part of the Department of Finance’s Reval – which is a reassessment of the rates system which businesses pay. While still a draft schedule of values, each council will also have to apply its own regional rate, based on the new proposed figures.“The Cathedral Quarter isn’t just about eating and drinking,” Gareth Neill, BID manager, Destination CQ told Ulster Business.“We have a vibrant ecosystem of arts and culture and fantastic built heritage that makes this area stand out, hospitality plays an integral part to the quality of le in this part of Belfast – for a city to be striving to attract new residents, increase our tourism offer these are crucial to the city’s success. “We are concerned about that the potential knock-on effects to the affected business owners and there’s a very real possibility it will have an impact on the price of a pint to the people who come to socialise in Cathedral Quarter. The knock-on effect of outdated methodology for calculation of rates on licensed premiseshas a potentially crippling effect on jobs and character of this area.”A spokesman for Land  Property Services said: “In Northern Ireland, nearly % of pubs will have no change or a decrease in their Net Annual Value .“Any business rate payer who thinks their new valuation may be incorrect, can contact LPS to arrange an informal review and supply any relevant information before the new valuation list comes into force on  April .”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mip1.jpg","title":"mipim taking belfast to the world","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by Ulster Business Joe ONeill and Suzanne Wylie Belfast Harbour boss Joe O’Neill will help lead a private and public sector delegation to MIPIM – the world’s biggest commercial property event – as chairman of the taskforce. He chats to John Mulgrew about the big announcements, fighting off the competition and attracting a global giant to Northern Ireland For Joe O’Neill and the wider delegation heading to potentially warmer climates, the proposition of selling the city and wider region to major investors has gotten easier.In the five years since Belfast ed to MIPIM – an event which sees tens of thousands descend on Cannes in France for four days of real estate and development – the private and public team, and taskforce, have developed a “strong ” in which to sell the city and Northern Ireland, with hopes of attracting a big name insurance or tech firm on the list.“MIPIM is a great  for the promotion of city-wide initiatives, and demonstrating to investors and to occupiers the growth potential in the city, and the opportunities for them and that the key stakeholders are all aligned behind an appropriate growth agenda,” Joe says.“You see dferent sizes and scales of stands out there – you see some really ambitious stands and proposed developments, so Belfast has to see it’s entry point into that. Belfast first and foremost will be competing against peer group cities within the UK… but then it is a worldwide show, so you will be competing against other cities.”Belfast is leading a major delegation this year, and will also be joined by representatives from other Northern Ireland councils, including those that are part of the Belfast Region City Deal, such as Mid  East Antrim. That deal is also going to be a focus for announcements and development, during the event.This year’s delegation will be led by a host of top private sector developers in Northern Ireland, alongside Belfast City Council and organisations such as Belfast Harbour. That includes Bywater, Wirefox, Titanic Quarter, Tribeca, McAleer  Rushe and Graham Group, along with the two universities and others working within related fields from law, professional services and the supply chain.For Joe and the delegation, MIPIM represents an opportunity to announce some of Belfast and Northern Ireland’s wider major new infrastructure and commercial plans. Previous visits have included the announcement of major offices schemes, hotels and apartment developments.“We will have a series of announcements – some of those announcements will be new, and some will be progress, and demonstrating to investors or occupiers that progress has been madeit’s a multi-year scheme, to show we are delivering.“… we have new projects coming through the pipeline in ious sectors. This year we are looking at launching schemes around digital innovation. That aligns with one of the themes in the Belfast Region City Deal, for the city and councils in the deal. We have a particular focus on cyber-security as an investment and operating location – particular those from the US.”Joe says that would be in addition to the already well-established cyber-security development at Catalyst in the Titanic Quarter, and that new names are coming in to the marketplace creating a “cluster” around the sector, and setting up Belfast and beyond as a new global hub.“We are looking at announcing some details around the Belfast-Dublin-London corridor,” Joe says.“As an economic corridor, or triangle. Post-Brexit, there are clear synergies in developing a proposition where companies can avail of the three locationsthey are looking at a global footprint, and see advantages to locations in three cities.”The issue of increasing connectivity between Belfast and Dublin also remains high on the list – improving the speed and frequency, and making developers aware of the new Belfast Transport Hub, which will transform the city’s rail and bus connectivity when complete.For Belfast Harbour, it’s also bringing the expansion of its already successful film studios to MIPIM, amid further plans to grow and develop the hub to attract big names and become the largest of its kind outside London.“We will be revealing more of our expansion plans, which is being supported by NI Screen,” Joe said. Some of those delivering their own presentations to potential investors will include the Harbour, Belfast City Council, Catalyst and the universities. “We are out looking around, when we are there, at what dferent cities are doing – seeing whether something works well, and looking at our competitive advantage in that area.”As for the strengths and attraction for potential investors, Joe says: “Skills, talent and technology are very much at the fore. Agility as a small region and to be able to respond, and seeing that team Belfast is there and that we are aligned with a particular project. It doesn’t have to be taken back home and introduced to someone .“There is the emergence of Belfast as an attractive city – investment opening up, and people are always looking at new markets. “Part of the initial roll-out when I took on the chair of MIPIM, the role was to go around to ask those who were on board previously to ask about it,it had changed. Everyone noticed and recognised considerablechange over the last four years. “We were pioneering and establishing ourselves four years ago, now they felt we were very much a concerted and effective operating team… the collective was a powerful message, and having  or lunches involving all of the stakeholders at one time. It’s a really strong  to take on the next chapter.”So, for Joe and the rest of the MIPIM delegation, what would be considered a major goal or success on the back of the visit to the commercial property show in March  “A particular focus this year is to attract key institutional investors – the big insurance companies for example. That’s a chicken and egg situation… you need to have product, to have product you have to show that you have occupiers and a steady revenue stream. “What we have been able to say to the investment market is ‘we have product and we now have sustainable occupation coming through… now it feels like the right time for you as an investor, to come in, and to support further investment’.”Asked whether replicating the successes of our neighbours in Dublin in attracting tech giants such as Apple, Facebook and Google is also on the cards, Joe says: “Something like that, or a major investor. For them to do that – a technology or an investment company – they need to see that the public, private and third-tier sectors are all collaborating together to make an effective market, and I think we are good at doing that now.”And the timing couldn’t be better for the delegation – now able to go in with a clear mandate and message with the restoration of the Executive and ato day-to-day power-sharing politics.“The positive thing for us is with the government and secondly, somearound Brexit… it takes those two challenging issues off the table.” πView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/johnm1.jpg","title":"companies must act quickly on new ir legislation reforms","story":"Posted on Monday February  by Ulster Business At the start of this year the government launched a review into the changes to IR legislation which will affect medium and large private sector organisations and have far-reaching impacts on the way they engage with non-permanent workers, writes John Moore, managing director, Hays NI.The timeframe between the review and the reforms coming into effect in April is shorter than many would have liked but with the reforms now on the horizon, companies need to act, particularly those in sectors such as technology, construction and finance where use of contractors operating as personal services companiesis common. At a basic level, the reforms to IR legislation sht the responsibility of determining the tax status of personal services company workers to the company that engages them where previously they could self-certy. The original rules required the freelance contractor to determine their tax status, but HMRC believed non-compliance was common.Now,a person’s assignment falls outside of IR legislation, they are deemed to be self-employed, so gross payment will be made to the PSC. Butthe assignment falls inside of IR, the professional should be treated as an employee, applying PAYE and NIC deductions from their payment. In simple terms, the tax arrangements for contractors are changing so that they won’t get such a good dealthey can’t demonstrate their work is out of scope and employers will have to pay more for using and keeping what were previously non-payroll workers.This will have a big effect on how people choose to work and who they choose to work for, not to mention how organisations plan and budget. An organisation’s policy towards contractors will affect how attractive they are to freelancers. But on the other side we’ve already seen some risk averse companies adopt a blanket ban on freelancers just to be safe – meaning they are missing out on skilled professionals they need to deliver projects.In Northern Ireland, as where, it’s likely the IR reforms will hit technology hardest, but the effects could be wide ranging across roles in construction, project management and finance.We’ve heard anecdotal evidence of IT contractors leaving the big banks and starting to view early stage tech companies with less than  employees more favourably because they fall outside the scope of the legislation. When similar legislation was introduced in the public sector in , hundreds of highly skilled contractors left roles to join organisations who were prepared, often leading to projects being scrapped. Now the private sector is catching up, preparation is key and anyone who hasn’t done a review of what it means for their capacity should do so urgently. A Hays survey showed % of private sector firms expect cost increases when IR reforms come into effect, % expect to lose key talent and % think it will be harder to bring in non-permanent workers. A third of organisations surveyed were completely unaware of the reforms – a big concern given how tight the labour market is.So, first you need to determine whether assignments are inside or outside of IR. You need to have full visibility of all workers your organisation engages who are paid via agencies and consultancies as well as knowledge of how they are paid. You will also need to have the expertise to determine the tax status of each assignment. When you know that you can then start communicating with freelance workers, renegotiating working arrangements, standardising onboarding procedures and decidingany specialist skills need to be brought in house to get projects over the line.If you expect to use a high volume of temporary workers in , outsourcing your temporary worker provision through a managed services programme could be an option, as an expert would carry out accurate assessments for every temporary worker placed with you.Whatever stage you are at, don’t ignore IR. It’s coming and you need to understand it.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20200109_-3489_web.jpg","title":"nie networks keeping the lights on and a focus on the future of power","story":"Posted on Thursday February  by Ulster Business Paul Stapleton, managing director of NIE Networks, sits down with Ulster Business to chat about the future of energy here, huge investment across Northern Ireland and the responsibility of keeping the lights on for almost two million people In the last three decades, Paul Stapleton has already seen signicant sweeping changes across the energy industry, and is now helping lead the charge towards a carbon neutral economy with an ever-increasing focus on green power.He is now at the helm of NIE Networks – an organisation responsible for the electricity network here, delivering reliable power to , businesses, homes and farms right across Northern Ireland.“Our role is to provide a safe and reliable network – keeping the lights on  ,  days a year,” Paul told Ulster Business.And part of that responsibility and ability to ensure strong and reliable electricity flow is an investment of around £m each year, working towards a  ‘net zero’ carbon emissions target and embracing the key changes and evolution in power here.“Many dferent players need to work together to ensure the electricity system of the future can achieve what it needs to achieve in terms of zero carbon and remaining economically efficient, and reliable, at the same time,” he says.“We are the custodians of the electricity network – everything between where power is generated and up to and including the meter in your home or business.“Our network is connected to , customers – that’s every home, every farm, every business, and every organisation in NI. It’s a regulated utility business, and commercially, everything is regulated by the Utility Regulator.”Paul’s been in the energy industry for his entire working le. The Limerick man joined ESB in  where he held a number of senior management positions, before taking up his current role in May .He’s taken over NIE Networks as it’s hitting record performance targets, with those likely to improve further still this year.“The network is in as good as condition as it ever was, and we are giving a good service in terms of continuity of supply. “In , we achieved a ‘customer minutes lost’ average of  minutes, which is the lowest in our history. But we will continue to look at improving further. Where faults do occur, % are fixed within three hours and % within less than  hours. “We operate in business cycles around regulatory price controls. We are now just over two years into a six year price control. “There has been some downsizing, cost-reduction and efficiencies, while we are gearing up to deliver a signicant capital investment programme. We are investing more than £m a year in upgrading, refurbishing and maintaining the network.“The focus in present terms is about delivering for today and looking to enhance our services to customers.”But it’s the future of NIE Networks, power generation, and a new Strategic Energy Framework, which will become the focus for Paul and his team in the coming years.“A lot of my focus is about planning for the future, as well as the day-to-day,” he says. “The longer term horizon is now looking out to ,” he says. “The UK Government has enshrined in legislation the target that the economy will be entirely carbon neutral.”For Northern Ireland, it’s already broken recent records in terms of the move towards green energy. “There is a huge amount to be done and it’s a very challenging target,” he says.“It’s a huge change and transition. But I think all the scientic evidence regarding climate change suggests it has to be done, and maybe has to be done sooner.“The headline target was that we would hit % from renewable sources by . We actually achieved that target and are now at %. That is very signicant progress. It puts us ahead of GB and the Republic of Ireland.”NIE Networks has invested around £m in the network to facilitate this generation. In the last few years the number of power generators connecting to the network has grown to ,, whereas two decades ago it was reliant on the three main power stations here.“The bigger challenge is how do we use that green energy to displace carbon  That brings in transport and heat, and that’s something where the electricity sector will play an important role.“As we all start adopting electric vehicles, as I think we all will in the next decade, we have to make sure people have the ability to charge them, at home and in public spaces. It’s our role to connect the chargers and to make sure we have a network which has the capability to meet the demands.”But Paul says there’s signicant positivity out there, with a younger generation in Northern Ireland and throughout the world embracing the small everyday changes that have to be made in order to tackle an international problem.“We are in the policy framing stage and  is going to be key. There is a call for evidence now from the Department for the Economy to inform the development of a new Energy Strategy for Northern Ireland and I would encourage anyone who has any interest in energy or climate change to contribute into that.“Hopefully that will lead to the development of clear policy initiatives, targets and measures for Northern Ireland and that will set the context for the market to respond.“I think there is economic opportunity for Northern Ireland, but there will be some downsides. We need to minimise the downsides and maximise the opportunities.”NIE Networks is currently examining its role in the future energy market in Northern Ireland. That includes looking at how it can make the distribution network more open and accessible in order to allow burgeoning technologies, such as battery storage, heat pumps and electric vehicles, to be introduced and operate in a sustainable way.“We see our role as evolving. Historically, we were somewhat passive – we provided an infrastructure which shipped electricity from A to B. Now, we need to be much more proactive and we are part of an overall system.”That includes a role in balancing when green energy is available and when it is required and in high demand on the distribution system. “All of that needs a more connected and dynamic distribution system – rather than just being seen as a physical infrastructure,” Paul says.“We need private investment and developers who are willing to invest in new solutions, whether it’s wind, solar, electric vehicle charging or heat delivery. All of those need policy directions, but they also need a network to connect to, so we have a major role to enable all of that.”Paul says most businesses and iniduals now know that they “have to get on this journey” in order to play their part in tackling climate change, reducing their carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency.With Brexit, there have been concerns over the future of the all-island energy market. But Paul is confident that it will be secured, despite the UK’s exit from the EU. “That continuing is really important for businesses in Northern Ireland. Currently, all sides in the Brexit debate seem comfortable that the Single Electricity Marketwill continue, so we don’t see any specic threat around that.”As part of NIE Networks’ Northern Ireland-wide investment in infrastructure – of around £m a year – it has recently completed a £, investment in the Cathedral Quarter area of Belfast – where our interview took place – which is home to many of its best known pubs and restaurants. “That gives us a more resilient and reliable supply, as well as capacity for the future,” Paul says. Some of the other latest investments include projects in Enniskillen in advance of a new public realm scheme, along with another in Newry.“Right across Northern Ireland we are continuing to invest,” Paul says. “There is a lot going on. There’s a lot to do today, challenges, to keep efficient supply for the economy, but equally we need to plan for the future.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
