Photograph: Tom Honan Pubs that have been closed for at least two years will be eligible for redevelopment into housing units without planning permission once new regulations come into force next week. The move will add public houses to above-shop spaces in Irish towns and villages, and planning exemptions for both will be extended to 2025. Detailing the additional steps to further increase urban accommodation among vacant buildings, Minister for Housing Darragh O’Brien said they would be limited to nine units and external building fabric and protected structures would remain in place. The proposal is an amendment to principal Planning and Development Regulations 2001-2021 and is expected to pass through the Oireachtas, as required under law, by the end of next week. Previous regulations making change-of-use of certain vacant commercial premises, including areas above ground floor, exempt from planning were introduced in 2018 and have so far yielded 1,400 residential units. “That’s not something to be sniffed at in my view,” Mr O’Brien told the Oireachtas Housing Committee on Thursday, outlining the proposed changes. “That’s a really good use of empty space and vacant properties… I think we can do a lot better.” In looking for further similar opportunities to produce housing in this way, pubs had sprung to mind. “A lot of our public houses are very prominent buildings in our towns and villages across this country and indeed in our cities. So, to me, it makes eminent sense that those public houses will fall in under these exemptions.” Unlike in the previous regulation, the 250sq m restriction will not apply given the potential complexities of differentiating between the licensed and unlicensed parts of a building. However, other rules will apply, including that a limit of nine residential units continue, and a premises will have to have been idle for at least two years to qualify. “We don’t want people just closing a premises and saying, right I’m going to now convert this,” Mr O’Brien said. Protected structuresIn response to some concerns raised by members of the committee, the Minister said other limitations included minimum storage space, floor area, natural light and habitable rooms in order to ensure good quality. Rules around protected structures and the external built fabric also remain relevant. The altering of façades or adding on additional buildings would not be permitted, he said, and the local planning authority would have to be notified two weeks prior to the beginning of works.“There is no fear that residents might have about there being major changes to the footprint of these areas. I think what is really positive about it is we’re going to be able to try to get people and families back living in” towns and villages. In a separate discussion on spending estimates for the year ahead, the Housing Committee heard the department expected to have non-exchequer funding of about €91.5 million from the proceeds of Local Property Tax (LPT). The overall budget for 2022 will exceed €5.9 billion, comprising €2.5 billion in current funding and €3.4 billion in capital funding, while there is also €276 million capital carryover from 2021.This year will see more than €3.6 billion allocated to housing programmes, an increase of €527 million (17 per cent).

prehistoric","story":"A 5,000-year-old chalk “drum”, discovered in the grave of three children has been dubbed “the most important piece of prehistoric art to be found in Britain in the last 100 years”.The intricately-carved chalk cylinder was first found in 2015, but its existence had not been revealed until Thursday.It\u0027s unearthing helps to prove that at the time Stonehenge was under construction, societies across the British Isles shared artistic and possibly religious customs rather than forming isolated communities.The drum will go on display as part of the World of Stonehenge exhibition that launches at the British Museum on February 17.Neil Wilkin, the curator of the exhibition said: “This is a truly remarkable discovery, and is the most important piece of prehistoric art to be found in Britain in the last 100 years.”The drum, which has carved motives along its sides closely resembles the Folkton drums, which were found in 1889 and have been in the museum ever since.The new discovery, found in Burton Agnes in East Yorkshire, just 15 miles from Folkton, is only the fourth of its kind to be excavated.The Folkton find, however, was never successfully dated and little was known about the objects’ context.This latest discovery has allowed archaeologists to apply new technologies, including radiocarbon dating, unlocking information not just about the Burton Agnes find but the Folkton drums, too.The date of the burial and therefore the carving of the drums has been put at 3005–2890BC - the same period during which Stonehenge was first constructed.Archaeologists said this was significant because it showed that communities in Britain were sharing artistic styles and possibly religious beliefs across significant distances.Dr Wilkin, said: The elaborate motifs found here on the Burton Agnes drum and also on the British Museum’s Folkton drums, are seen on a range of prehistoric objects discovered across Britain and Ireland.“This tells us that there was an ‘artistic style’ of the people who built Stonehenge. Because we can date the burial this drum was found in, it means we know these ideas existed at the beginning of Stonehenge’s era. It’s game changing in that sense, and hugely exciting.Previously, archaeologists had believed the Folkton drums to have been carved 500 years later, well past the period of Stonehenge’s construction.What this remarkable discovery tells us is that the period of Stonehenge was not insular or shadowy as is often assumed. Here, and in the objects we are showing in the Stonehenge exhibition, we can see shared ideas and artistic styles that have made it to all four corners of these islands almost. Culture and ideas were massively interconnected even 5,000 years ago, just like today, said Dr Wilkin.The children the drum was buried with were of differing ages, with the two younger iniduals placed into the grave holding hands while the eldest child was found embracing them.Dr Wilkin called the grave “highly moving”, saying that “the emotions the new drum expresses are powerful and timeless, they transcend the time of Stonehenge and reflect a moment of tragedy and despair that remains undimmed after 5,000 years.Despite their names, the objects are not musical instruments but are thought to perhaps be protective talismans.The Burton Agnes drum was also found alongside a chalk ball and polished bone pin, which lay beneath the head of one of the children.The significance of both objects is unclear, but similar items have been found at other burials, again suggesting shared culture across Britain.The gravesite was found during routine archaeological excavations ahead of a construction project. For the past seven years, it has undergone extensive study and conservation work.Alice Beasley, a project archaeologist for Allen Archaeology who first uncovered the drum, said: “Discovering the chalk drum was a thrilling and humbling experience. Seeing the love and effort put into burying the iniduals over 5000 years ago was truly moving.”The new drum will go on display in the Stonehenge exhibition alongside all three Folkton drums. It will be displayed at the British Museum on loan from the Burton Agnes Estate.After the exhibition, it will undergo further assessment and analysis.More from NewsLabour MP Neil Coyle reported for ‘racist comment’ to journalistDame Cressida Dick: The high-flying Met Police chief who couldn\u0026#39t shake controversyWhisper it, but I’m beginning to see how Boris just might survive thisWhat Cressida Dick’s resignation means for Boris Johnson and the ‘partygate’ investigationThe runners and riders who could replace Dame Cressida Dick as Met Police CommissionerDame Cressida Dick forced out of role as politan Police CommissionerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"cressida dick must not become sadiq khans scapegoat","story":"Last year was challenging enough for every part of the country, but in London we also had to deal with a particularly horrifying crime problem. Even as we began to venture out of the pandemic and rebuild our lives once again, the capital never felt less safe. At the same time, tragic cases such as that of Sarah Everard, murdered at the hands of a serving police officer, have contributed to record low levels of police confidence.We saw 30 teenage homicides, officially surpassing 2008 to become the deadliest year since records began. When a single dead person is a tragedy, thirty murdered teenagers is catastrophic. It has never been more important to ensure the safety of our streets, and yet I have never been more concerned that the Mayor of London is not doing enough. Any way you look at the statistics, they are a frightening reflection on Sadiq Khan’s tenure as Mayor, with a particularly negative impact on ethnic minority communities.At this juncture, it is quite clear that problems at the politan Police go far deeper than who holds the job of Met Commissioner. Sadiq Khan is the Police and Crime Commissioner for London. He consults with the Home Office to appoint the politan Police Commissioner, and indeed he agreed to a two-year extension to Dame Cressida Dick’s contract just a few months ago. At that point he would have known about the Charing Cross inquiry, the issues with the Steven Port investigation and other Met failings, which he is now citing to undermine her position.If Khan’s worry was sincere, then surely it would have been raised much earlier. He should have been working with the commissioner to make London a safe city, enacting a plan of action rather than putting her “on notice”. He should have been figuring out how to restore the effectiveness of the police force, given that since he took office in 2016, sanction detection rates have fallen from 17.3 per cent to just 8.7 per cent, despite there being more police on London’s streets than at any point in almost 20 years.Yes, it is true that the Met needs to address a culture of silence when inappropriate behaviour occurs, perhaps by giving whistle-blowers anonymity barring exceptional circumstances. No one can deny that there are serious changes that need to be made. It also needs to be made easier for us to scrutinise. For example, we are currently unable to measure the success of allocated “anti-crime” funding. But these things can be done without immediately changing the Met Commissioner.Behind all the blustery statements over the last few days is a rather simple fact. Sadiq Khan is ultimately accountable for policing and crime in London. He is the Mayor of London, not some casual bystander, and must get a handle on it himself. However much he might shift the blame, it is Sadiq Khan’s responsibility to protect this city, and he is letting everyone down by leaving them at the mercy of an inefficient and dangerous system.Susan Hall is the leader of the Conservatives in the Greater London AuthorityMore from NewsLabour MP Neil Coyle reported for ‘racist comment’ to journalistDame Cressida Dick: The high-flying Met Police chief who couldn\u0026#39t shake controversyWhisper it, but I’m beginning to see how Boris just might survive thisWhat Cressida Dick’s resignation means for Boris Johnson and the ‘partygate’ investigationThe runners and riders who could replace Dame Cressida Dick as Met Police CommissionerDame Cressida Dick forced out of role as politan Police CommissionerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"durham university told covid policies disgrace donor suspends","story":"Durham University has been told its Covid policies are a “disgrace” by a major donor who has suspended his support in protest at their prolonged use of online teaching.The Russell Group institution has “failed” its students, according to the millionaire Mark Hillery who has severed ties with his alma mater and resigned from the advisory committee of his old college.He told The Daily  that there is “simply no logic” in continuing to impose restrictions on students, adding: “The people spending their days dreaming this stuff up need putting back in their box now and told to do a proper job.”Over the past six years Mr Hillery, a retired hedge fund manager, has donated more than £7million to the university’s Collingwood College where he read engineering in the late Eighties.His money has funded various buildings and facilities including the Mark Hillery Arts Centre as well as a yoga and pilates studio, bar conservatory and expanded JCR common room and gym.He has also gained notoriety among students for putting large sums of money behind the college bar when he visits to fund free drinks for them all night.But Mr Hillery has now cut ties with the university and told his old college that he does not wish to engage with any further dialogue.“Someone had to say something publicly about this ongoing insanity for the sake of the students. It’s depressing it has to be that way,” he said.“The final trigger for me, and I warned them it would come, was the imposition of ridiculous rules and restrictions way beyond what prevailed in ‘normal’ society from the beginning of the new academic year in late September.“The reversion to online teaching at the start of this term took the madness to another level, but the damage had already been done for me since September.”He told the Durham student newspaper Palatinate that the online teaching at the start of this term was an “unequivocal disgrace” given that the Government’s policy was for face-to-face teaching to take place.When students returned after Christmas they were told that all lectures would take place online for the first fortnight of term, blaming omicron for fuelling “large numbers of Covid-19 cases.Only labs and practical classes were allowed to go ahead in person during the first week of term and small to medium teaching groups of fewer than 40 students were allowed to take place face-to-face during the second.The university operates a “test to participate” where students must have evidence of a negative lateral flow test taken up to 48 hours previously in order to visit college bars, play sport or attend formal dinners. A spokesman said on Thursday that this scheme would be wound down over the coming weeks but that voluntary testing would still be encouraged. Students are expected to wear face masks throughout the university\u0027s buildings. Government guidance states that “no student should be denied education on the grounds that they are, or are not, wearing a face covering”.Mr Hillery said: “Higher education establishments have collectively short-changed their clients for too long here and that was simply the final slap in the face.”“They all deserve bottom marks. They have failed some of our most talented kids here. Their priorities have been totally misaligned.“It is both bizarre and deeply cruel that the last people in the country to have this insanity imposed on them are healthy 20-year-olds for whom Covid is an irrelevance, and the majority of which are vaccinated and have had Covid anyway…who makes that up with a straight face?”A Durham University spokesman said Mark Hillery was a generous benefactor whose contributions have improved our students’ experience and will continue to make an impact for many years to come.They added that their approach throughout the pandemic had “always prioritised the health, safety and wellbeing of our staff, students and wider community”.They said they had “taken into account a wide range of information and perspectives” including both Government guidelines and advice from local public health directors.More from NewsLabour MP Neil Coyle reported for ‘racist comment’ to journalistDame Cressida Dick: The high-flying Met Police chief who couldn\u0026#39t shake controversyWhisper it, but I’m beginning to see how Boris just might survive thisWhat Cressida Dick’s resignation means for Boris Johnson and the ‘partygate’ investigationThe runners and riders who could replace Dame Cressida Dick as Met Police CommissionerDame Cressida Dick forced out of role as politan Police CommissionerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"starry night mesmerising photo milky way wins astrophotography","story":"A photograph of the Milky Way in all its glory has claimed the top prize in an astrophotography competition organised by the South Downs National Park. \u0027Snow in Springtime\u0027, shot by Neil Jones, captured the starry sky above St Mary\u0027s Church near Upwaltham in West Sussex.

He will have to cancel public engagement for at least five days.While the Prince and Duchess were together on Tuesday evening, it is believed that they will now choose to stay apart from one another to allow the Duchess to continue with her programme while in full health.The news of the Prince’s illness caused alarm among Royal-watchers on Thursday, coming after the Queen returned to in-person duties following a period of rest after she fell ill and suffered mobility issues last year.A Palace source said the situation will continue to be monitored but a running commentary would not be provided on the Queen\u0027s health.People who develop coronavirus symptoms are asked to notify those they have been in contact with in the previous 48 hours.The Queen is understood to be fully vaccinated and under current guidelines will not need to self-isolate unless she tests positive.On Wednesday, she met Boris Johnson, the Prime Minister, in person after a series of weekly audiences on the telephone. Mr Johnson wished the Prince a speedy recovery.At the weekend, Her Majesty undertook her first major public appearance in more than three months, hosting charity workers at Sandringham on the eve of her Platinum Jubilee.On Sunday, she used a written message to thank the public for their support during her long reign. She used the opportunity to ask them to one day welcome her daughter-in-law, the Duchess of Cornwall, with the title of “Queen Consort”.On Thursday, the Duchess spoke for the first time about the Queen’s “sincere wish”, telling a member of the public who asked her directly that she was “very touched” and “very, very honoured”.During a solo engagement to the Thames Valley Partnership in Buckinghamshire, the Duchess said she was lucky not to have tested positive herself.Willie Hartley Russell, high sheriff for Berkshire, said afterwards: She said something like he\u0027s finding it a bit tiresome to have got it again, but she said it in a light-hearted way.The Prince sent a message to crowds in Winchester after being compelled to pull out of a visit at the last minute, telling them he was deeply disappointed.Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, said: Given the fact that the Queen saw her son and heir less than 48 hours before he was confirmed to have Covid for a second time, there is inevitably a huge level of concern for the monarch, given her age above everything else.Clearly, a very close eye will be kept on Her Majesty in the coming days to see that nothing is amiss.More from NewsLabour MP Neil Coyle reported for ‘racist comment’ to journalistDame Cressida Dick: The high-flying Met Police chief who couldn\u0026#39t shake controversyWhisper it, but I’m beginning to see how Boris just might survive thisWhat Cressida Dick’s resignation means for Boris Johnson and the ‘partygate’ investigationThe runners and riders who could replace Dame Cressida Dick as Met Police CommissionerDame Cressida Dick forced out of role as politan Police CommissionerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"whisper beginning see boris just might survive","story":"The Prime Minister we see before us now is a very different creature to the one who governed by diktat for the best part of two years. He’s humbly asking Tory MPs what to do, then doing it. It’s humiliating, but it’s greatly improving the quality of the Government. He has broken free from Sage (whose advice on omicron turned out to be bunkum) and didn’t seek its advice before deciding to abolish all remaining Covid restrictions a month early. Warming to his theme, he’s now referring to this as “freedom day”.Some of his worst ideas are being abandoned. His plans to set up an all-powerful Animal Sentience Committee to judge government policy now look doomed. His anti-obesity strategy – whereby a Conservative government would tell shops what sort of food they could and could not promote – is being shelved.This holds out the prospect – no more than that – of the big-state, bossy Boris giving way to the buccaneering, risk-taking and freedom-loving leader they thought they were getting when they first elected him. So far, it seems he’s prepared to do anything to survive. Even reform the NHS.So it was a typical Boris bad idea: a tax rise forced through, but with no one working out how little difference the extra cash would make.From the back benches, Sir Edward Leigh raised a question. If repairing the NHS is not doable, he asked, what happens to those who don’t have a year or two to wait for an operation? If private insurance means you can be treated in weeks, might the cost of this insurance be written off against tax, as it used to be? This idea would once have been dismissed out of hand as the roar of a Tory dinosaur, but the Health Secretary said he’d think about it.He’ll be doing a lot of thinking – and the result may well be something resembling an NHS reform plan. At a recent Cabinet awayday, the Prime Minister said after months of NHS pom-pom waving he now realises the need to change – and that Javid would be changing the NHS as radically as Michael Gove once reformed schools. So Javid has the green light – although not, as yet, much of an agenda.The need to reform is now horribly apparent. When the NHS was first promised £12 billion from the National Insurance rise, ministers were told that this should cut waiting lists to \u20285.5 million. Unpublished NHS modelling says it could be 11 million. It’s a staggering difference: one Tory MP said that, when he heard the news, he thought this was the moment that the party lost the next general election. To have taxes at a 71-year high and the largest NHS waiting list in history would represent abject political failure.But if reform starts now, there may be some hope. Patients who wait more than six months, for example, could be subsidised (or covered) if they want to go private. The idea of a patient’s passport, an old Conservative policy, could be dusted down.Reforming the NHS carries huge political risks. But the current situation – a gargantuan bill and a waiting list that has more people than the population of most European countries – brings guaranteed political disaster. And that’s before factoring in the hour-long ambulance waits and the 500 people a day who wait more than 12 hours to be seen at A\u0026ampE.Johnson will have a bit more time now: even those who want him gone talk about the May elections as the next date. “But even that sounds like procrastination,” says one minister. “No one can think of a better idea, so it’s fizzling out.”Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss remain the two favourites to succeed Johnson. Neither is ready to run now, or in the near future. Nor are their allies fomenting rebellion: some of them are actively talking it down, saying that Johnson is likely to survive as he has done before.The current obsession with the Met’s investigation into Partygate might, paradoxically, help the Prime Minister. If he is not fined, he can claim vindication – and move, straightaway, to focus on his great Covid reopening. If he keeps moving while his enemies are still, there’s every chance of his regaining momentum.More from NewsLabour MP Neil Coyle reported for ‘racist comment’ to journalistDame Cressida Dick: The high-flying Met Police chief who couldn\u0026#39t shake controversyWhat Cressida Dick’s resignation means for Boris Johnson and the ‘partygate’ investigationThe runners and riders who could replace Dame Cressida Dick as Met Police CommissionerDame Cressida Dick forced out of role as politan Police CommissionerBoris Johnson will not get taxpayer-funded lawyers to navigate ‘partygate’ investigationMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dwp faces legal action reveal","story":"DWP faces legal action to reveal algorithms that flag claims of benefit fraudCampaigners say disabled people are being unfairly targeted and living in fear of the brown envelope thanks to mysterious computer processes that the government has never fully explainedThe Department for Work and Pensions has  days to respond to the latest letter Image: PA Archive Press Association ImagesByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsThe Department for Work and Pensions is facing fresh legal action to reveal what “algorithms” it uses to flag claims of benefit fraud. The Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People has sent a “letter before action” demanding ministers “come clean” about techniques it claims is throwing disabled claimants into crisis. The campaign group says disabled people have had questions raised over their benefit claims through a phone call, e-mail or “brown envelope” in the post without knowing why. Sometimes they have essential cash “cut off” at the beginning of probes that can last over a year, the group said. GMCDP spokesperson Rick Burgess said benefit claimants of all stripes are singled out, but campaigners believe the algorithm is “over-picking disabled people for investigations of fraud”. He told a meeting tonight: “You have no idea how it came about that you’re being investigated - none whatsoever. “It’s extremely upsetting when people get this.”  He added: “We are living in a shadow penal system that treats us like criminals for having to meet the same needs as everyone . The fear of the brown envelope makes disabled people feel terrorised, in a constant state of anxiety and on edge.” It is the second legal letter sent by the same group on the subject, with the first going out before Christmas. The DWP responded in December, but the group alleges the government has still not answered key questions about what technology it uses to flag possible fraud. The fresh legal letter - to which the DWP must respond in  days - challenges the “use of AI, algorithmic technology and other forms of automation” in investigation of benefit fraud. It says the DWP uses “data matching” and “machine learning”, but other techniques may be being used and the DWP is not being clear about what they are. The letter says there is a “risk of bias” to automated processing.  It demands the DWP set out “detailed information” on its use of computer processes and sets up “adequate safeguards”. Barrister Will Perry, who is representing the legal action supported by the “tech justice” group Foxglove and Privacy International, said: “We know there is a data matching algorithm being used. “The DWP seem to be experimenting with a wide range of dferent technologies.” DWP Permanent Secretary Peter Schofield has previously insisted computer systems “guide our work” but “we do not take any action against anyone based on a machine.” He added: “It always comes down to an inidual.” Universal Credit director-general Neil Couling said last year: “It is not an algorithm in the way in which I think people may understand an algorithm.“All we are doing is data matching,… We take what the RTI [earnings] data tells us, and whether a person has reported earnings to us.” A spokesman for the DWP said: “The DWP will be responding to the letter written by the representatives of the Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People in due course.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Department for Work and PensionsDisability\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It was unclear tonight whether Chief Medical Officer Sir Chris Whitty or Chief Scientic Adviser Sir Patrick Vallance were even consulted on Wednesday’s announcement – which came before PMQs in the Commons instead of at a press conference.The Department of Health refused to confirm whether their advice was sought on ending restrictions. A No spokesman would only say they continue to provide advice to the Prime Minister and Health Secretary. And as curbs including the requirement to self-isolateinfected look set to end a month early, on February , other Government scientists said the news had blindsided them.  Prof John Edmunds, a member of Independent SAGE, said: “We haven’t discussed it there.” He added of the PM: “Of course he gets scientic advice from where as well – the UKHSA [UK Health Security Agency] and others – so he may have had other scientic advice but not that I’m aware of.” He added: “Of course there are dangers. There are dangers when you lt any restriction. This restriction is the last one and quite rightly so. It targets those who are actually infectious and asks them to stay at home.” Another scientist questioned Mr Johnson’s motives for making England the first country to end all pandemic curbs despite sky-high infection rates. Prof Tim Spector, the epidemiologist running Kingaposs College London’s Zoe Covid study, said: “This is more a political type of statement rather than a scientic one.There is some rationale to this and other countries are doing things similar, but it’s clearly a race for the Government to say that Britain is first.” Dr Stephen Grfin of Leeds University said: “Literally blinding ourselves by removing testing and isolation robs us of the most fundamental means of controlling the spread.”  After  Covid deaths and , positive tests reported in the UK today, the British Medical Association called on the Government to justy ending self-isolation rules. The BMA’s Dr Penelope Toff said: “The suggestion that self-isolation may be removed this month runs contrary to good public health practice.“The Government needs to show the evidence behind its proposals. There are still more than , patients with Covid in UK hospitals.”New data from the Zoe Covid study this week suggested cases may still be rising, with an R value of . for the UK. The study estimates there were , new daily symptomatic cases at the start of this week, up from , last week, though Prof Spector said hospital admissions and deaths were down.  People with conditions that mean Covid vaccines may not work for them voiced alarm at the plan to end isolation rules. Grandad Paul Simpson, , from Rochester, Kent, was diagnosed with stage four glioblastoma brain cancer last year. He said: “They seem to be prepared, in order to hold the Tory party together or to gain popularity in the nation, to throw quite a lot of people under the bus.” Hannah Burden, , spent  days in intensive care with Covid before Christmas. The student, from Leicestershire, told The Mirror: “By the end of the month you could be in the supermarket with people who know they have Covid.”  Blood Cancer UK estimates more than , people with the condition will be at an increased risk. Of plans to protect the vulnerable, the Department of Health said details would “follow in due course”. The plan to end curbs on February  will be reviewed three days before.

In an opinion article for the , he described the group as naive at best before adding Putinaposs regime would see the group as “virtue signallers” who were “providing a smokescreen so it can go on beating up and jailing those brave iniduals that dare to stand up to its despotism on the streets of Russia”.It comes as Boris Johnson warned tensions in Ukraine will reach a “dangerous moment” in the coming days with Russia on the brink of doing something “disastrous”.The Prime Minister travelled to Brussels and Poland in a show of support to his Nato allies describing the the situation as one of the worst European crises in decades.

We don’t want to threaten anyone. It’s us who are facing threats.” Ms Trussaposs diplomatic efforts appeared to have failed as Mr Lavrov likened their conversations to the mute with the deaf and he accused UK diplomats of coming “unprepared” to their crunch talks.

In an interview with The Times, Sir Keir said Mr Johnson had used a deliberate slur without any basis in fact. The PM knew exactly what he was doing. It is a conspiracy theory of violent fascists that has been doing the rounds for some time, he said. Mr Johnson last week ly accused his rival of failing to prosecute notorious paedophile Jimmy Savile while he was director of public prosecutions.On Monday, police escorted the Labour leader away from demonstrators, some of whom accused him of protecting paedophiles. I have never been called a paedophile protector before. That happened yesterday for the first time in my le, Sir Keir said.  If others want to argue that this is unconnected with precisely what the Prime Minister said one week before then let them make that case. But theyaposll never persuade me that there is no link. Itaposs not about me, itaposs the way we conduct our politics. I donapost want to see us go down the route that this potentially takes us. Earlier, Sir Keiraposs spokesperson said he was fine after the incident. A spokesman for the opposition leader told reporters: He was back at his desk straight after. Police did their job. Obviously these things look sort of rougher on the camera often than they are. But, as I say, police did a good job, he was back at his desk afterwards and he was off playing five-a-side football that night as normal. A host of Conservative and opposition MPs have called for Mr Johnson to apologise for what was branded a scurrilous accusation against Sir Keir.  The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman acknowledged his original words last week in the Commons were capable of being misconstrued and said that was why he subsequently issued a clarication.The Prime Minister claried his remarks last week to make clear he was not suggesting Keir Starmer was inidually responsible for the Savile decision, the spokesman said.He added: I think the Prime Minister was making a political point about taking responsibility for organisations as a whole. Mr Johnson tweeted on Monday evening that the behaviour directed at the Labour leader was absolutely disgraceful. Although Sir Keir was head of the Crown Prosecution Service in  when a decision was taken not to prosecute Savile, he had no personal involvement in the deliberations.Labour said Mondayaposs incident occurred when Sir Keir, who was accompanied by shadow foreign secretary David Lammy, was walking back from the Ministry of Defence after a briefing on the situation in Ukraine.Read MoreRead More Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Labour PartyThe TimesMinistry of DefenceJimmy SavileDavid LammyBoris JohnsonPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

It comes amid a furious row over £ million worth of contracts handed to test firm Randox - who paid former Tory MP Owen Paterson as an advisor. The Government was forced to release papers relating to the deal last week.Among the disclosures were text messages between Matt Hancock and Mr Paterson - showing how the former MP lobbied the then-Health Secretary on behalf of the firm.In one message, Mr Paterson suggested the pair discuss speeding up the process in the Commons voting lobbies during a vote. But hauled before MPs today, Health Minister Maggie Throup repeatedly refused to confirm the meeting took place.Asking an urgent question following the release of the documents, Labour chair Anneliese Dodds said: Theypaint a picture of a Conservative Government that is simply unfit for office. That the Conservative Government played fast and loose with public money. It handed Randox a £ million contract, without competition.On the meeting between then-health minister Lord Bethell, Mr Paterson and Randox on April  , the Labour Party chairwoman said: There are still no minutes of that crucial meeting on April . Just a rough draft email, sent seven months later. Two years on, the department canapost even explain who was there.Health ministers held, we now know, another four meetings that were never declared in the register. So how many more secret meetings were there  The Labour chairwoman added: The file showed that this former MP, a paid advocate for Randox, was arranging meetings with the health secretary in the ision lobby. A place which only MPs can have access and where it is impossible for civil servants to join them.Ms Throup made no apology for the Governmentaposs actions to acquire Covid testing equipment, and suggested the note released in the Randox files about the meeting on April  is the equivalent of an official record of a meeting. She said: When the department received a Freedom of Information request for the minutes of this meeting, the private secretary found the minutes and shared it. And for clarity, notes and minutes mean an official record of a meeting. The words mean the same from an official meetingaposs record point of view.  Ms Throup also stressed there are robust rules and processes in place to assure that all contracts are awarded in line with procurement regulations and transparency guidelines. She added: Direct awards, like in this case, are permitted by the public contract regulations for reasons of extreme urgency brought about by unforeseeable events. Iaposm sure no member would deny that this was a situation of extreme urgency. The minister faced further questions about the meeting in the ision lobby, with Hull North MP Dame Diana Johnson asking: The documents showed that there was a meeting with the former member for North Shropshire and the former secretary of state for health and social care in the ision lobbies... Did that meeting take place  Ms Throup replied: The evidence has been put in the library and obviously information is there and obviously I want to make it clear that my department went through as much evidence as they could. Dame Diana could be heard shouting yes or no! as the minister answered.  Mr Paterson resigned from the Commons in November last year, after he was found to have lobbied - against parliamentary rules - on behalf of Randox, for which he was a paid consultant. The saga prompted a sleaze scandal in Westminster after Boris Johnsonaposs Government launched a defence of Mr Paterson and tried to save him from a -day suspension, only to back down when under considerable pressure.The documents released on Friday February  show the extent to which Mr Paterson was in contact with the then health secretary over Randoxaposs offers to provide coronavirus testing services.A spokesperson for Matt Hancock said: The extensive transparency publication proves Matt did nothing wrong. So much so, we encourage your readers to look at it. To suggest Matt was doing anything other than acting in the national interest is not journalism but proof of an agenda. Matt cannot control who contacts him, but he followed protocol and Owen Patersonaposs lobbying was flagged to officials. To suggest Matt should have ignored the UK’s biggest existing testing capacity because he was being contacted by Owen Paterson is absurd and would have been a dereliction of duty. Matt is incredibly grateful to Randox for the enormous part they have played in the national effort to combat covid.

But Nadine Dorries did tonight set the threshold at which she’ll turn on the Prime Minister -he kicks a dog. Askedshe’ll “support others in withdrawing your support” for the PM,he’s found to be criminally negligent, she told CNN: “No, absolutely not.” But she insisted “of course there are” situations where she would abandon him. “You knowhe went up and, you know, kicked a dog, Iaposd probably withdraw my support for him,” she said. “But no, based on, you know, his professional delivery for the UK, no, absolutely not”. West Ham are investigating a video which showed the team’s Kurt Zouma kicking his cat amid public outrage.A legal expert today said Boris Johnson could face more than £, in lockdown fines as police prepare to write to more than  people over Partygate, starting this week.Barrister Adam Wagner reminded the public that lockdown fines double on each occasion, soBoris Johnson was fined over all six events he is thought to have attended, he could have to stump up large sums of money. But Top Tory Ms Dorries tonight insisted “Remainers” or “people who never wanted him to be Prime Minister” want Mr Johnson gone, and they should “get behind the Prime Minister”. Despite the Sue Gray report finding “failures of leadership and judgment by dferent parts of No  and the Cabinet Office”, loyal defender Ms Dorries insisted: “She didn’t express a failure of leadership in Boris Johnson’s government at all.”  She added: “Has he failed in any way on delivering for the country, no he hasn’t.” It is the latest in a string of ardent defences by Ms Dorries of Boris Johnson, who plucked her from the back benches and put her in his Cabinet. She bristled “why are you asking me that question ” when askedshe’d spoken to the PM.And she brushed off claims the PM was spreading “fake news” about Keir Starmer failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile, shrugging and saying: “I don’t believe that’s the case.”Earlier, one Tory MP elected in  expressed bafflement. At one point Nadine seemed like she was trying to provoke letters to go in,” they said. “Every time she tweeted, another few MPs told me they were more likely to put in a letter.

On the desk in front of him - from where he read out quiz questions to teams across the building - is what appears to be champagne and a half-eaten packet of crisps. Mr Johnson was accused of personally breaking Covid laws by hosting the festive event after the Mirror revealed last year that it had taken place. At the time London was under Tier  regulations banning any social mixing between two or more people from dferent households.  Official guidance also stated: “You must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.” Just two days after the Mirroraposs initial story, the PM said: “I can tell you once again that I certainly broke no rules. But the Christmas quiz is not one of the dozen No  gatherings under investigation by police. This is despite a smaller festive quiz held in the Cabinet Office just two days later being looked at. One Covid laws expert said that Scotland Yard should now add the Downing Street Christmas quiz to the list of events it is probing. Barrister Adam Wagner told The Mirror: The previous photograph of the Prime Minister showed what could have been a meeting briefly interrupted by a Zoom call. However, the new photograph shows four people with alcohol and food, as well as a Christmas hat and tinsel, which suggests a Christmas party. This was held at a time when indoor social gatherings of two or more people were banned and the Government had told people they must not have a Christmas party. The top lawyer added: In light of the new evidence it now makes no sense for this gathering not to be investigated by the police given that an almost identical gathering in the Cabinet Secretary Simon Caseaposs office two dayaposs later is being investigated. In the new image, Mr Johnson appears to be putting a badge on his suit jacket.  Later that evening, No  pins were distributed to Downing Street staff as a Christmas present from the PM. Downing Street has insisted the event was a “virtual quiz”, but admitted “those who were in the office for work may have attended virtually from their desks.” Labour MP Fabian Hamilton raised the photo in PMQs - and contrasted the merriment to a constituent who was unable to have visits from her family while having cancer treatment. He said: For the sake of my constituent and the sacrices she made, will the PM be referring this party to the police as itaposs not one of the parties being investigated  But the PM hit back, saying: He is completely in error. He later said the event had been submitted for investigation. Former No aide Dominic Cummings warned: Thereaposs waaaaay better pics than that floating around, incl in the flat. No pointed out the event itself had already been considered by Scotland Yard, which decided not to investigate it further. But the PM’s Press Secretary could not say whether the newly-revealed photo had been sent to the Met, saying: “I’m not aware of that and it wouldn’t be appropriate for me to comment”. Of Sue Gray, the Press Secretary added: “She has had access to all information that is relevant and required.” Asked what was happening in the picture, she said: Weaposve talked about this one before, it is a virtual quiz. The Mirror revealed last year that dozens of staff had spent the evening huddling in groups around their office computers rather than dialling in from home. In one office, the insider said, there were four teams, each made up of six people. Sources said staff had knocked back fizz, wine and beer - and some stayed in Number  socialising and drinking for hours after the quiz finished at .pm. Team names included Professor Quiz Whitty, Next Slide Please, Weaposve Been Clear”, “The  Masketeers” and Hands, Face, First Place - a reference to the slogan introduced to encourage social distancing and mask wearing.  The Mirror also revealed an email showing organisers had planned days in advance for some staff to enjoy the quiz in person, from the office. A senior official even urged staff, including teams from the PMaposs private office, the policy unit and the press office, to leave No  through the back door at the end of the night. Mr Johnson has spent the last few days trying to shore up support after mass resignations from No  last week raised further questions about his authority. Downing Street is hoping his defensive mini-reshuffle to promote loyalists - and the promise of a bigger reshuffle in early summer - will be enough to keep mutinous Tory MPs at bay. But many Tories are privately saying they are waiting for the result of the Met investigation and the full Sue Gray report to decide whether to trigger a confidence vote. The PMaposs allies have claimed that he will not resign evenhe is fined by the politan Police for breaching Covid rules. One former Cabinet minister told the Mirror: “If Sue Gray finds he lied to parliament unequivocally, or depending what action police take - that’s it. Either of those two things would be terminal.

Small loans announced by the Government – that must be repaid by us – are cold comfort after the energy price cap was lted £. Labour deserves congratulations for backing a windfall tax and suspension of VAT. Even Margaret Thatcher and David Cameron imposed one-off levies on North Sea producers. The resistance of Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak to a similar move means this Government is siding with big corporations against working people.  Sinking ship Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle rebuked lying Boris Johnson over his Jimmy Savile smear against Keir Starmer He showed how an unprincipled Prime Minister exploits Parliament loopholes. The Speaker judging the slur inappropriate rather than disorderly showed how Johnson will be dishonest but avoid punishment. What’s more, his incitement fuelled a mob to abuse the Labour leader. The PM’s desperate mini-reshuffle was a reshuffling of diehards in the deckchairs on board his sinking Government ship. Unconditional support isn’t repaid by Johnson when he demoted fanatical defender Jacob Rees-Mogg from Leader of the House to an invented Brexit Opportunities post as a middle-ranking minister of state, albeit invited to sit in the Cabinet room with his superiors. Once again we witness Johnson caring only about himself. Conservative MPs should throw him overboard to save themselves. A Brit special Brits starring in Oscar nominations and at tonight’s Brits awards is great news. When it comes to films and music, we’re seen and heard all around the globe.

The General Secretary of the UKaposs most powerful trade union has demanded the party leader back bin workers on strike in Coventry over a pay dispute with the Labour-run council. The union pays £m in affiliation fees to Labour, but has cutback funding already and Ms Graham has warned she could go further. She said: “Let me be very clear – the remaining financial support of the Labour Party is now under review. “Your behaviour and mistreatment of our members will not be accepted. It’s time to act like Labour, be the party for workers.” But Sir Keir warned the union that he is not going to be challenged and the party will not be threatened by anyone. He told the BBC : The Labour Party I lead is not going to be influenced by threats from anybody, whoever they are. And thataposs just an absolute matter of principle for me. So this is very, very straightforward. Itaposs not about the you know, the particulars of a dispute here or dispute there. I am not prepared for the Labour Party I lead to be threatened by anyone. Period, full stop.Askedhe would be happy for Unite to desert the party, he said: Iaposm not going to have the Labour Party I lead threatened by anybody and thataposs the long and the short of it. The merits of inidual disputes, Iaposll debate all day, uphill and down dale, but Iaposm not going to be challenged. Weaposre not going to be influenced by those who say, you know, weaposll only provide moneyyou do X. No. She has said: “The Coventry Labour council has time and again totally misrepresented the union’s claims for its bin drivers. It should be ashamed of the spin it has tried to make about its own workers’ pay rates. “These dreadful misrepresentations are deliberately designed to enrage the general public which directly risks the welfare of workers who are taking part in an entirely legal dispute, and this, a Labour council. “Other councils up and down the UK have increased pay rates for refuse collection drivers to preserve services due to the HGV driver shortages. “If other councils can increase pay rates to preserve services and prevent an exodus of drivers, there is absolutely no reason why Coventry council can’t do the same.”  Ms Graham, who took over after Len McCluskey stood down last year, said on Wednesday that both regional and national funding for Labour from Unite will now be under review. She urged Labour to “pick up the phone and get this sorted”, saying: “It’s utterly disgusting that this council is putting workers through this misery. “If we have to escalate, we will escalate and I personally will be getting involved. “If we have to go door to door to tell the truth about this dispute, we will do. “Our wallet is closed to bad employers.”Sir Keir also insisted Labour had changed massively since Jeremy Corbyn stood down and that for every critical voice across the Labour Party and labour movement there were hundreds of supportive voices.He said: My first task was to change the Labour Party we lost very badly in . And what Iaposm concerned is not so much what our members think but what the public think because itaposs the public that we need to persuade to vote for us. But I can tell you this, that for every critical voice in the Labour Party, there are hundreds of supportive voices because members of the Labour Party are in the Labour Party, because they want to see a Labour government. And thataposs what Iaposm focused on. Thataposs what theyaposre focused on.And thataposs, you know, what weaposre putting all our energy and all our commitment into facing up to the next general election facing the public, not looking inwards and having the discussion in the Labour Party.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON \" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Parents Noel and Sue have a whopping  kids, with the Radford brood ranging in age from  all the way down to one year old. While some of the older children have moved out and started families of their own, the majority of the Radfords all live in an enormous ten bedroom house in Morecambe. Sue and Noel took part in the final christening for their two youngest daughters Heidi and Bonnie in the most recent episodeof Channel  series ‘ Kids  Counting’, which documents the family’s often-hectic le.  The gathering in Morecambe Parish church was the first time four generations of the Radford family had gathered in one place in over two years, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the Daily Star reports. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the vicar Catherine Hayden was daunted but excited by the prospect of managing such an enormous brood. “This is my first Radford baptism,” Catherine admitted. “I love doing baptisms, and I love having a church full of children, so it is a very exciting thing to be doing.”  “I don’t think I’ve ever seen that many people from one immediate family in a church, it’s great to have them here though.” Despite the stresses of the day’s preparations, Bonnie and Heidi’s ceremony went largely unhitched. There were a few tears from Bonnie when the vicar dripped holy water onto her head, while Heidi pulled a rather bemused expression.  “It was nice, a nice little service, Bonnie wasn’t overly pleased with the holy water side of it, but yeah, she’s alright now,” Noel reflected. “It’s been a really stressful week, but the kids have come through,” Sue added. Although the day was rounded off successfully with a £-a-head buffet, the preparations had almost been disrupted by some of the younger children’s antics.  Earlier on in the episode, Sue had been shocked to find that one of the christening dresses had been used to wipe up juice, while youngster Max caused havok after hiding his new jeans. There were mixed emotions, though, when the couple realised that this would be their final christening after declaring earlier on in the series that they would be having no more babies.  Sue acknowledged: “It’s a bit emotional isn’t it, that it will be our last christening for our kids. That’s it, we’re going to watch the kids grow up, more grand-kids will come along.” However, the couple’s eldest daughter Sophie, , was not convinced. “I personally think there’ll be a couple more children from mum and dad,” she suggested. “And I’m never wrong.”Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Channel Radford FamilyBabiesParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ten-month-old Luna is a really sweet girl who was diagnosed with a progressive disease named wobbler syndrome, which causes her to lose balance and coordination.The clumsy rescue dog is completely unaware of her disability and loves running around and jumping up for kisses.She is currently being looked after by a foster carer, but will have toto the kennels at South East Dog Rescue she cannot find a permanent home. Kymm White, founder of SEDR, understands it is a monumental ask, but is desperate for Luna to be rehomed at last.to ourTeamDogs newsletterfor your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Little Luna was surrendered to SEDR in July , after her previous owner’s relationship broke down. She went on to have ious tests which diagnosed her with wobblers syndrome - this means she often slips on floors and easily bumps into things. Kymm hoped Luna could have surgery at the Royal Veterinary College, to slow down her progressive condition, but soon realised that it wasnapost possible. It would involve several months of intensive crate recovery and Luna absolutely detests being in a crate. She will even cause herself severe injury to avoid being in one, Kymm explained.  Without surgery, Luna will have a short le expectancy and will be “very lucky” to hit her third birthday. Kymm describes Luna as a sweet-natured, clumsy girl who has heaps of energy and would do just about anything for a treat and a cuddle. Luna gets very excited when itaposs time to go for a walk and adores human attention. “She jumps up and tries to kiss you - which can be overwhelming with her wobbliness,” Kymm said. Luna is vaccinated, microchipped and spayed, and currently living with a temporary foster carer.She is looking for a permanent, loving and understanding family that has experience of dogs with progressive conditions. The Staffy will need a quiet environment with no young children or cats, and a secure garden and soft space to move around in case she does fall over. Luna would ideally suit someone who can spend a lot of time with her at home, and take her on active walks. “We know that the type of homes suited to take on a dog like Luna are very few and far between, due to her needs and the emotional commitment,” Kymm said. I understand this is monumental, and ask that any potential adopter really considersthey can go through such an emotional roller coaster. Kymm added that le is not fair and said her heart breaks for this sweet girl. The SEDR team are determined to to find Luna a very special home, where her last few years can be full of love, care and dignity.Do you know a dog that desperately needs a home  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimalsRoyal Veterinary CollegeLoveLe expectancyAdoption\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Adrian Bendell crashed into a motorbike being ridden by Mark Norris, , and his teenage pillion passenger.The horric smash killed Mr Norris and left his -year-old passenger with a bleed on the brain, the permanent loss of the use of an arm and pelvic injuries. Bendell fled from the devastating accident in Fyfield, Essex, and took his white Ford Escort van to a scrap yard in a bid to evade justice.But his plan fell apart after it emerged the badly battered van had been captured in dash-cam footage, revealing massive damage where it had been in collision with Mr Norris’ motorbike. Police were able to use the registration details to begin a search for the killer driver.  They got a big breakthrough in the form of a tip-off that Bendell had taken the battered van to be scrapped within hours of the fatal accident. Officers were told the van driver had taken the van there on the same evening as the pm death crash on August , .White Ford vehicle parts were also found in a skip at the scrapyard, whose owner had urged Bendell to hand himself in to the police.

He was charged with causing death by dangerous driving, causing serious injury by dangerous driving, perverting the course of justice, failing to stop at the scene of a collision, and failing to report a collision.  He admitted all charges, other than perverting the course of justice, at a hearing at Chelmsford Crown Court.

He was also disqualied from driving for seven-and-a-half years and will be required to take an extended driving test.Inspector Mark Fraser, of Essex Police, said: “Mark Norris was dearly loved by those who knew him and his death has had a massive impact on them.“Adrian Bendell was reckless and his actions after the collision were callous. Rather than stop to try and help Mark and his passenger, he made off, leaving him to die. “His first thought was how he could cover his tracks and dispose of the vehicle.”  Inspector Norris praised his officers for tracking down Bendell, of Braintree, Essex. “Through the dedication of the team working on this case, he was unable to get away with his crime and has now faces justice, he said. “No conviction or sentence can ever bring Mark back but I hope this result will help his family move forward. After Mark’s death last summer his family said: “Mark was a dearly loved and devoted father to Joe and Sara, partner to Helen, son to Jan and friend to everyone that knew him. “Mark was a keen and experienced motorcycle rider and enjoyed everything motor powered.” They said his death had left a huge hole in their hearts.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Essex PoliceCourt caseCrown courtDangerous drivingDriving test\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Lily Gordon lted up her top and removed several packages containing illegal substances when asked by officersshe was hiding anything, a court heard today. The -year-old claimed: I know you won’t believe me but I found them.Officers descended on Gordonaposs Salford home in  and caught the defendant trying to bury a package in a plant pot in her back garden, reports Manchester Evening News. They asked what she was hiding and she replied: Something I found over there. Officers then found three silver-wrapped cannabis resin bars, the court heard.  Three years on from the seizure due to ious delays in the case, Gordon pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply cannabis and possession of diamorphine. Prosecutor Eleanor Gleeson said that there had been inordinate delays in the case before it made its way to court. “The offences were committed in December , the drugs were sent off for analysis and didn’t come back until April  to confirm they were diamorphine and cannabis,” she said. “There was a further delay until October  which was chased by the CPSand found that simply GMP did not send what was required of them to authorise the charge properly.”  She said the delay continued due to the police not providing the correct evidence and due to inactivity, the case was put to one side. GMP later sent the relevant evidence in September  and over a year later in October , the case was reopened. It later became apparent that part of the delay was due to the officer in the case being on maternity leave. Ms Gleeson said that on December , , officers attended a house on Wall Street, and found Gordon at the back of the home trying to bury something silver into the soil in a plant pot.  “The officer asked aposWhat are you hiding Lilyapos to which she replied: aposSomething over thereapos and pointed towards the bins in the garden,” she said. The officer searched the plant pot and found three silver-wrapped cannabis resin bars. The house was then searched and no drugs were found. Another officer searched Gordon and askedshe had anything on her and she replied “no”. “As the officer began the search, she askedthe defendant had anything inside her bra, Ms Gleeson told the court. “She then lted her bra and removed one larger brown bag and four small bags of a brown substance.“She then said, “I know you won’t believe me but I found them”. They also seized an iPhone, a Nokia and a bank card in her name in her coat pocket. The drugs were analysed and found to be . grams of cannabis and . grams of diamorphine. The cannabis was valued at £., the court heard. Gordon was said to have two previous convictions for five offences, all of which were for possession of cannabis. Mitigating, Jane Miller said she had made continuous efforts to contact the police to find out what was going on in the case over the course of the three years. “During that period she had the expectation that the proceedings were coming her way,” she said. “Also, during this time, her daughter has died. “She is ashamed to be appearing here today in relation to the proceedings.” She said her client has two sons, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Her daughter died in . Sentencing her, Recorder Graham Wells said: “You did try to hide it and you weren’t being initially honest about it right from the start, but you did indicate you were going to plead guilty. “This has taken far, far too long to come to court. “In the meantime, I have read in your pre-sentence report that you have given up smoking cannabis and have tried to put things right.” Gordon, of Liverpool Street, was handed a -month community order, a three-month curfew between pm and am - she was also fined £.

Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up . They told the Sun : Shouting is absolutely aposoff limitsapos for the children and any hint of shouting at each other is dealt with by removal.And instead of sending their kids to the naughty step or to their rooms, Kate and William have a apossofa chatapos. The source explained: The naughty child is taken away from the scene of the row or disruption and talked to calmly by either Kate or William. Things are explained and consequences outlined and they never shout at them. But when Kate and William have royal engagements to attend to, their nanny, Maria Borrallo takes over the childcare duties.  Read MoreMaria trained at the prestigious Norland College, in Bath, which is well known for training the caretakers of the UKaposs most notable families.The nannies are taught everything from defensive driving to security issues to how to care for a future king or queen, royal commentator Victoria Murphy told ABC News shortly after the birth of Princess Charlotte.So [Borrallo] just really knows everything that you could possibly need to know about bringing up a child.She was hired by the family back in  when George was just eight months old and now looks after Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis too. She lives in Kensington Palace and travels with the family on visits and royal tours as a discrete presence. Maria is believed to be very strict with the royal children and like all Norland Nannies has a no-nonsense approach.Norland expert Louise Heren told the Sun : There will be no messing. Thataposs because Maria will be aware that as they step off planes, holding mumaposs hands, smiling and waving to the crowds, there canapost be any crying or terrible twos or tantrums. The children have a pm bedtime, which has to be stuck to, and all playtime must take place outside, no matter the weather.Louise said: Lots of bike rides, playing with their dogs, potentially some gardening. Norland are very into teaching children through play. If it is tipping down, they will still go out. Wet weather is just inappropriate clothing, you have to put the right stuff on.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

When it comes to modern romance, waiting to watch your favourite TV shows together is more likely to impress them than sending love letters.Almost a third of those who responded to the poll said the height of romance was using a picture of your loved one as your phone screen saver, while less than a fth said it was sending them roses. Top of the list was checking someone is home after a night out, with % saying it was the best way of showing someone you care. Travelling miles to be with them was next, followed by sending messages first thing in the morning and last thing at night.  While love letters are on the wane communication is still key to romance – it just takes a dferent form.High on the most-wanted list were regular videocalls when apart, regularly sending funny memes and never leaving someone hanging on a WhatsApp double tick.And sharing your TV streaming password is the best way of saying “I love you” for % of those polled.

But former England rugby player Mike, who is married to Prince Williamaposs cousin Zara, had to admit Kate looked effortless as she joined in a training session alongside players such as Leicester Tigers prop Ellis Genge. Speaking on his podcast The Good, The Bad and The Rugby, Mike admitted: I text Ellis and said ‘mate, please tell me anything she messed up on’ so I could sort of, family WhatsApp group, get into her.  “And he said ‘No she was actually pretty good, and she was really good at kicking’ and I was like…” Mike proceeded to give a large sigh and added: But she has this competitive nature where she has to be good at things.” His co-presenter Alex Payne agreed, saying: “She looked unbelievably natural.” And Mike added: Just imagine, anyone who’s ever tried it, getting thrown up in the line-outyou’ve never done it before is not easy because normally, you’ll kick the prop in either the nuts or the face as he’s lting you and she just looked effortless.”Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

Kate had been tipped to take on both jobs and confirmed her new duties in a video, which showed her throwing a rugby ball to dferent players. At one point even spins the ball on her finger. Meanwhile, Kate’s new affiliation with England rugby puts her in direct competition with husband William, who is the Welsh Rugby Union’s patron.

Gregorz Ewiak, , broke into the victimaposs home by crashing through the living room window and later threatened to kill her, it was claimed. Like a horror movie, blood was discovered on the TV, walls, carpets and door handles which revealed Ewiakaposs DNA, the prosecution said.When the terrying ordeal was over, he sent her a text threatening to take away her children, aged two and seven, reports Liverpool Echo.A judge told Ewiak his actions must have left the victim and her children absolutely petried.Liverpool Crown Court was told the female victim was at her home in Birchwood, Warrington, on October  last year.Ewiak, of Dagenham, London, was subject to bail conditions at the time, with an overnight home curfew due to extradition proceedings.  But the mum heard banging on her front door at around pm, before her living room window was smashed. She rushed upstairs, collected her children from their bedrooms and locked them in the bathroom with her. Prosecutor Jonathan Rogers said: She could then hear people in her home and she heard someone shout aposIaposm going to kill youapos in Polish. She didnapost recognise the voice but someone allegedly started banging on the bathroom door trying to get in. Neighbours called the police and the two intruders left the scene, the court heard. When officers arrived, they found the front door lock was broken, with the key snapped in the lock. Mr Rogers said they discovered large amounts of blood by the living room window and smeared throughout the property which revealed Ewiakaposs DNA. The prosecutor said the woman told a social worker Ewiak had confronted her a few weeks earlier suspecting she was having a relationship with a next-door neighbour. Ewiak was arrested and interviewed - but made no comment. He admitted burglary with intent to cause damage and criminal damage, after a charge of making threats to kill was dropped by the crown. Mr Rogers said Ewiakaposs victim concluded a statement by saying she is scared of the defendant because he is crazy. He said: She is unsure of what he may do and she believes the safest thing for her to do is toto Poland. The victim also wrote a letter to the court, but later said this was after being pressured into doing so, by two unknown iniduals. Recorder Ian Harris said the victim explained a letter was sent to the court in my name requesting a lenient sentence for Mr Ewiak and said the letter was made under duress. Ewiak has four previous convictions including theft in  and advertising prostitution in . In  he was jailed for battery after assaulting a former partner. That same year he was jailed for  months in Poland for inflicting grievous bodily harm. The court heard a letter from the mum of his child described him as a good father to their daughter and there was a letter from his daughter saying how much she misses her father. Benjamin Brown, defending, asked for full one-third credit for his clientaposs early guilty pleas and said he had no knowledge of the letter sent by the victim. He said: He accepts that he clearly should never have entered the property and he does recognise the impact upon his ex-partner. Mr Brown said: His sole focus and motivation now your honour is to become a good father to his daughter, who is  years of age. He fully appreciates and keenly feels the loss to her of a father figure as a result of his actions. The lawyer said Ewiak wanted to take up a job offer at a vegetable shop. He said: The defendant wants to become a beneficial member of society moving forward and is motivated to gain employment upon his release. Reading a pre-sentence report, Recorder Harris said: He only accepted limited responsibility for his offending and he doesnapost come across as being particularly remorseful. Mr Brown suggested language barriers may have contributed to that impression. Recorder Harris said the victim and her children must have been absolutely petried when locked in the bathroom. The judge said the sight of all the blood afterwards must have added horror to the fear that the woman and the children felt. He said Ewiak travelled up from Dagenham and when he arrived at the house, it seems to me there was an explosion of temper so far as youaposre concerned. Recorder Harris jailed him for two years and four months, adding: This is without prejudice to the extradition matter that as I understand it is going through the courts. He also imposed a seven-year restraining order to protect the victim.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BirchwoodCourt caseCriminal damageCrown courtSocial workersCrimeBurglary\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The moon takes . days to circle the planet, also known as a lunar cycle, which means a full moon takes places on a slightly dferent date each month. That means there is usually one full moon a month, although sometimes there is more than one – also known as a Blue Moon.

The first total lunar eclipse calls on May . This phenomenon happens when Earth lines up directly between the Sun and the Moon. When this happens the Earthaposs shadow covers the moon, causing the Moon to turn red when it reaches totality. The next total lunar eclipse falls on November . This happens two weeks after October aposs solar eclipse. The first Supermoon will fall on July . This phenomenon occurs when the Moonaposs orbit is closestto Earth at the same time as a full Moon. The closest point is an average distance of , miles from Earth. This means that moon will appear brighter and larger than usual. The second Supermoon will fall on July . What other moon phenomena are there  Blue Moon  In addition to Supermoons and total lunar eclipses, there are also Blue Moons. A Blue Moon means two moons occur within one calendar month. Despite the name, the Blue Moon isnapost actually blue. You may have heard the term once in a blue moon, which has come to mean a notably rare event. However, Blue Moons actually happen relatively regularly – every two to three years on average. Blood Moon A total lunar eclipse is also known as a Blood Moon, because when it happens the moon turns a reddish colour. This is due to the fact that sunlight bends through the Earthaposs atmosphere. The Moon orbits around Earth, taking around  days to complete a cycle, while the Earth orbits the Sun, going through a . day cycle. Lunar eclipses happen because the Moon orbits in a slightly dferent plane than the Earth and Sun do – however, at times their planes coincide. During a lunar eclipse, Earth passes between the Moon and the Sun, cutting off the sunlight. Space explains: During a full eclipse, however, something spectacular happens. The moon is fully in Earthaposs shadow. At the same time, a little bit of light from Earthaposs sunrises and sunsetsfalls on the surface of the Moon. Because the light waves are stretched out, they look red. When this red light strikes the moonaposs surface, it also appears red.

Tens of thousands are still coming down with the virus every day and, just as Charles will hope he has not passed it on to the Queen, they too will worry about spreading it. So Boris Johnson must explain why he unilaterally decided to bring forward the end of all Covid restrictions. One member of SAGE has said they were blindsided by the decision even though it has implications for millions of people’s health. It is also noticeable that neither the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Chris Whitty, nor the Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, have said whether they approve of the PM’s actions. People will rightly ask whether the Prime Minister is acting in the national interest or out of political expediency.  Fools rush in Everything must be done to prevent Russia from carrying out its threat to invade Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is playing a reckless and risky game by massing an estimated , Russian troops on the country’s border. The response from the West must be resolute and united. But there is a fine line between taking a firm stance against Russian aggression and inflaming an already delicate situation. Boris Johnson’s overblown rhetoric yesterday risked crossing that line.

Palace doctors will now test the Queen frequently after she saw her son at her Windsor Castle home on Tuesday, it is understood. The Prince of Wales, , is self isolating at home after testing positive after a routine test this morning, forcing him to pull out of a joint engagement in Winchester with we Camilla. Aides confirmed the future king was “not experiencing strong symptoms”, but the Duchess of Cornwall revealed he was finding the situation “a bit tiresome”. It is the second time the heir to the throne has contracted the virus, first doing so in March  when he had mild symptoms and lost his sense of smell and taste.Riding solo for a series of meetings today Camilla said she was feeling “lucky” to have not caught the virus. The Queen has been triple-vaccinated so will not need to self isolate, unless she tests positive. She received her first jab in January  and her second jab in March while sources say it is believed she got her booster jab in October. Buckingham Palace aides said they would not comment on the Queen’s personal health, but a palace source said “obviously the situation will be closely monitored”. The Queen is understood to be “feeling much better” recently after regaining her health after a torrid few months. She was forced to spend the night in hospital in October after receiving treatment for an unexplained condition.  Doctors ordered her to take a period of rest after she completed a relentless schedule of  engagements in as many days. The monarch then missed the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph in London in November after spraining her back.Throughout the pandemic, the Queen has largely been shielded by a ring of steel dubbed ‘HMS Bubble’, whereby  royal staff sacriced their home lives to stay isolated at Windsor Castle so they could serve the Queen and her late husband Prince Philip during lockdown.A year later, in April , strict Covid regulations meant the Queen was forced to wear a mask and sit alone as she attended husband Prince Philip’s funeral. In recent weeks she has been enjoying her freedom after making a trip to Sandringham, her Norfolk estate, to mark the anniversary of her father’s death and dau of her accession to the throne on Feb . The Queen was out and about on public duties on Saturday, the eve of her record-breaking Platinum jubilee, meeting charity workers at Sandringham House - her first major public appearance in more than three months. A source close to the Queen tonight said she was “not experiencing any symptoms” but her contact with Charles was “recently enough to be relevant”. The prince went to see his mother on Tuesday at Windsor Castle after awarding OBEs to chefs Fergus Henderson, who has Parkinson’s Disease, and his we Margot as well as an MBE to Dr Nisreen Alwan, who is known for campaigning for more awareness around long covid.On Wednesday evening he attended with Camilla a reception for the British Asian Trust with  guests, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Home Secretary Priti Patel at the British Museum in London on Wednesday evening. The heir can be released from his isolationhe tests negative on day  and day  and does not have a temperature. The triple-vaccinated prince was said to be “deeply disappointed” to have to pull out of engagements in Winchester after his positive test on Thursday. When he contracted covid for the first time last March he said he ”got away with it quite lightly” before spending seven days in self-isolation at his Birkhall home in Scotland before resuming his duties.Downing Street said Prime Minister Boris Johnson wished the prince a “speedy recovery”.On a solo visit to the Thames Valley Partnership in Buckinghamshire, Camilla said she was lucky not to be positive herself.  Speaking to Willie Hartley Russell, high sherf for Berkshire, during the visit today, she said: “He’s diagnosed now. Luckily . I’ve taken it so many times.” Mr Hartley Russell said: “It gets a bit pointless, doesn’t it ” and Camilla agreed. Speaking afterwards, he added: “She said, ‘Yes, unfortunately he had tested positive again. I said he must be building up lots of antibodies. “She said something like he’s finding it a bit tiresome to have got it again, but she said it in a light-hearted way.”  Earlier in the day, Camilla spoke for the first time to reveal her delight at the Queen’s statement on Saturday that it was her “sincere wish” that the Duchess of Cornwall be made ‘Queen Consort’ when Charles takes the throne. On a visit to the Nourish Hub community food centre in West London, Camilla was asked about how she feels about her future title. And in reply she said she was “very, very honoured” and “very touched” to receive the Queen’s backing to be a future Queen Consort.

When he passed away, his family honoured him by placing a floral tribute to Yorkshire Tea by his gravesideThe Yorkshire Tea floral tribute for Leslie Keith Dee Image: Chad Dee   SWNSByAdam AspinallNews Reporter:,  Feb |comments A tea-loving ex-builder was laid to rest beside a box of his favourite brew made out of flowers at his funeral. Leslie Keith Dee, , was known to drink up to  mugs of tea a day – strong, with a dash of milk and two sugars – and was rarely seen without some of the hot stuff in hand.So when the retired bricklayer passed away aged  on January , his family honoured him by placing a floral tribute to the brand by his graveside. Chad Dee, , one of Leslie’s  grandchildren, said the display commemorated the character of the fondly missed family man as well as his love of Yorkshire Tea. Leslie, from Gloucester, developed his love of tea while working on building sites.  Chad said: “On a cold building site, most of them would drink tea to warm them up by the flask.” Even when Leslie was forced to spend more time at home due to a hip replacement in , his family would always ensure tea was flowing. “Grandad had nine kids and he had  grandkids,” said Chad. “So someone would walk in and flick the kettle on. “He’d sometimes cough and so ‘Oh my throats dry’, as then we’d have to make him a cup!  “He was caring and kind. He’d do anything for his children and grandchildren.” Made by Plantation Florist the tribute was made out of real flowers – in the signature green and red Yorkshire Tea colours – that were woven into a tea box-shaped frame. Chad, who laid the floral tribute at the graveside during the funeral –attended by  people on January  –said he believed it was one of the first of its kind. He said: “When we came up with the idea, I Googled ‘Yorkshire tea tribute’ and there was nothing.” Yorkshire Tea, which has been produced by the Bettys  Taylors Group since , turned to Hollywood and Game of Thrones star Sean Bean to advertise its tea bags. The popular hot drink giant has the slogan “Where everything’s done proper”.

Now Stewart, , who was already serving a le term for killing childrenaposs author Helen in  was additionally convicted yesterday of murdering we, Diane, six years earlier. His chilling intentions were uncovered too late - to the fury of many, who have askedhe could have been stopped beforehand. Stewart, , killed -year-old childrenaposs book author Helen in  and dumped her body in the cesspit of the £. million home they shared in Royston in Hertfordshire. He had secretly drugged and suffocated her in a plot to inherit her £m fortune. A trial at St Albans Crown Court heard it was most likely she was suffocated while sedated by drugs, and Stewart was found guilty of her murder in .  His conviction prompted police to reopen their investigation into the death of his we, Diane Stewart,  - and crucial evidence uncovered the truth. It was originally believed that she had died from a sudden epileptic fit in the garden of the coupleaposs home in Cambridgeshire. But examinations of her brain years later uncovered the truth as brain tissue showed signs of suffocation, with prosecutors suggesting Stewart could have forced a plastic bag over her head. Now questions are being asked about why he was free to murder Helen after signs of foul play were allegedly missed in Dianeaposs death.Speaking to The , Shelley Whitehead who befriended Helen said: aposIt really raises questions about how someone so very evil could literally get away with murder, and do it again.aposDid they look at this bereaved, vulnerable father, this man whose we has aposdiedapos from an epileptic fit, the father who now has to raise his boys on his own - is he so convincing that they didnapost do the proper checks  Or was something overlooked apos  Epilepsy Questions have been raised over whether anything was missed in the original investigation of the murder of Diane Stewart. Though she had epilepsy, she hadnapost suffered a fit for  years and controlled her condition with medication. But her husband claimed he ed from a shopping trip to find her collapsed after hanging up washing. At the trial, an expert claimed her chances of suffering a fatal epileptic fit were about one in , Yet, this was originally recorded as her cause of death, with an inquest concluding she had suffered a sudden death in epilepsy , which kills about  people each year.  Coroners inquest According to the coroneraposs file that was seen by The , pathologists carried out a non-forensic post-mortem examination and recommended epilepsy as the cause of death,aposno toxicological or anatomical causeapos was found. This was reached despite no tell-tale signs of a fit, such as evidence of tongue biting or physical injuries matching the claim she had fallen onto a concrete patio, as her killer claimed. Full toxicology tests were not carried out during the examination in  - with screenings only carried out for an anti-epileptic drug. A decade on, experts found physiological changes in her brain known as ischemia as a result of suffocation, rather than the so-called epileptic fit. This could have ruled out a sudden death - as it develops over time and indicated she was unconscious for some time before her death.  CPR claims Stewartaposs claim that he performed CPR was doubted by a paramedic who found no evidence of blood or froth on his face - which there would have beenhe had attempted it. During a  call, he was instructed to perform mouth-to-mouth and claimed he was doing so, but paramedic Spencer North, who attended the scene, said there “didn’t seem to be any effective CPR”. There were also no signs of injuries caused by CPR - or even cuts or bruises on Diane, which youaposd expectsheaposd collapsed on the concrete patio as claimed. Speaking to the BBC, neighbour Vanessa Easton, a nurse, recalled arriving home and seeing Dianeaposs body.I remember thinking at the time aposthank goodness thereaposs no blood... she looks perfectapos. Speaking to the BBC yesterday, Det Supt Kent acknowledged there were suspicious factorsyou compare them to what happened to Helen Bailey. Of course we didnapost have that information or evidence at that stage, he said. At the time of Dianeaposs death there was nothing to suspect that Ian had been responsible or that she had died at his hands.

He said: “The lack of parts for new car manufacturing resulted in a surge of sales in the second-hand car market, creating a lucrative business for car thieves to fill the shortage.  “Prestige models have always been the go-to for criminals who exploit the demand for these desirable cars in territories like Europe, Middle East and Africa. “We are continuously intercepting shipping containers packed with stolen vehicles at ports around the country and  was no dferent. However, due to the pandemic lower value cars have also seen an increase in theft rates.” The rest of the top  cars stolen last year were BMW  Series , Land Rover Discovery , Vauxhall Corsa , Vauxhall Astraand Mercedes-Benz E-Class . LeaseLoco chief executive John Wilmot said the figures show just how important it is for people to take extra precautions to securely lock their car. He said: The Ford Fiesta may be about to lose its title as the best selling car in the UK but it still retains the unenviable title as the most stolen car in Britain.  “While the Range Rover Sport, one of the most popular luxury SUVs on the market, has been targeted by sophisticated criminal gangs who have the knowledge and keyless tech to gain entry. He said: If you take the right precautions you can avoid becoming a victim of car thieves - and that goes for any car owners. Always make sure your car is locked before you walk away and check that it’s locked at night.

The caller reported that he had accidentally shot his brother while loading a gun because there was a bear on their property, Mr Snyder said. Upon arrival, Deputies located a deceased male from an apparent gunshot wound.  While checking the rest of the residence, a second deceased male was located with what appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The undersherf went on to say local detectives were being assisted by detectives from the Oregon State Police.

Big sauropods could have s stretching more than m, which would likely have been quite uncomfortable when suffering from a cough, breathing trouble and fever. The remains are the first evidence of respiratory infection in a non-avian dinosaur. The specimen, which has been nicknamed aposDollyapos, was discovered in Montana in  and dates back to the Late Jurassic Period, around  million years ago. Cary Woodruff and colleagues from the Great Plains Dinosaur Museum in Montana looked at three bones from Dollyaposs neck and found never-before-seen abnormal bony protrusions.  Each bone, which had an unusual shape and texture, would have been attached to air-filled structures, known as air sacs. These connected to the lungs and formed part of the dinosauraposs respiratory system.Scans of unusual protrusions on the bone suggest that they most likely formed in response to an infection. Part of the abstract of the study reads: While we cannot pinpoint the specic infectious agent that caused the airsacculitis, this diagnosis establishes the first fossil record of this disease. Additionally, it allows us increased insight into the medical disorders of dinosaurs from a phylogenetic perspective and understanding what maladies plagued the aposfearfully great lizardsapos.  The scientists have wagered that Dolly was suffering from a fungal infection similar to aspergillosis, a common respiratory illness that affects birds and reptiles. They believe itaposs possible that Dolly died as a result of the infection. Given the likely symptoms this animal suffered from, holding these infected bones in your hands, you canapost help but feel sorry for Dolly, said Woodruff. Weaposve all experienced these same symptoms — coughing, trouble breathing, a fever, etc. — and hereaposs a -million-year-old dinosaur that likely felt as miserable as we all do when weaposre sick.Slightly closer to home, two years ago a visitor to Penarth beach in Glamorgan found what is now believed to be the extremely rare footprints of a dinosaur from more than  million years ago. Scientists have now revealed they believe the extremely rare tracks come from a time when the supercontinent Pangea was still intact. Initially, the tracks were thought to be part of the geological process of the beach and scientists were sceptical about them being footprints. But further evaluation indicated they were dinosaur tracks from the late Triassic period which is when dinosaurs began to reign supreme on Earth. Paul Barrett, anthropology palaeobiologist at the museum and co-author of the study, said in a statement: We believed the impressions we saw at Penarth were consistently spaced to suggest an animal walking. These types of tracks are not particularly common worldwide, so we believe this is an interesting addition to our knowledge of Triassic le in the U.K. Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DinosaursMuseums\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The situation in the country has been described as one of the worst European crises in decadesDesna military training centre where Ukraine soldiers take part in training exercises with the use of the British-supplied NLAW Image: Andy Commins   Daily MirrorByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Feb |commentsBoris Johnson has warned tensions in Ukraine will reach a “dangerous moment” in the coming days with Russia on the brink of doing something “disastrous”.The Prime Minister travelled to Brussels and Poland in a show of support to his Nato allies describing the situation as “one of the worst European crises in decades”. Russia has denied it plans to invade Ukraine but has massed troops on the border and has carried out army exercises as it flexes its military muscles.As many as , Russian and local troops began “exercises” less than  miles from the Belarusian border to the north.Meanwhile, up to , Russian troops are on Ukraine’s eastern flank, backed by , pro-Moscow separatists in contested Donbas.  Standing alongside Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels today, Mr Johnson said: “The stakes are very high and this is a very dangerous moment. “At stake are the rules that protect every nation - big and small.” But he insisted Britain has an “absolute” and “immovable” commitment to bolstering Europe’s security.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss urged her controversial Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to pull troops back from Ukraine’s border to ease tensions.Ms Truss’s visit to Moscow was the first by a Foreign Secretary in four years, with the relationship between the UK and Russia severely strained by incidents including the  Salisbury nerve agent attack. She said: “There is still time for Russia to end its aggression towards Ukraine and pursue the path of diplomacy.  “But Nato is very clear thatthat path is not chosen there will be severe consequences for Russia, Ukraine and the whole of Europe.” But Mr Lavrov rejected Ms Truss’s call for forces to pull back. “The demands to remove the Russian troops from the Russian territory cause regret. “We don’t want to threaten anyone. It’s us who are facing threats.” Ms Truss’s diplomatic efforts appeared to have failed as Mr Lavrov likened their conversations to “the mute with the deaf” and he accused UK diplomats of coming “unprepared” to their crunch talks.  Labour leader Keir Starmer had also travelled to Brussels for talks with Nato chiefs, the first Labour leader to do so in more than a decade. Mr Starmer seeks to re-establish the party’s relationship with Nato after his predecessor Jeremy Corbyn called for the alliance to be disbanded.He lashed out at Mr Corbyn and said he was “wrong” on Nato and insisted his party’s commitment is now “unshakeable”. Distancing himself from his predecessor’s views, he said: “Jeremy Corbyn had a very dferent view, he was wrong about that and I spoke out at the time about that.”  Mr Corbyn had described Nato as a “major problem and a major dficulty” before becoming leader of the Labour Party - but never made it party policy to withdraw.Mr Starmer later launched a fierce attack on the Stop the War coalition, in which Mr Corbyn is a leading figure, accusing it of siding with Russia against Nato. In an opinion article for the , he described the group as “naive” at best before adding Putin’s regime would see the group as “virtue signallers” who were “providing a smokescreen so it can go on beating up and jailing those brave iniduals that dare to stand up to its despotism on the streets of Russia”.

Kyan Pennell died on January  when he got caught between a trailer and a gate at his family’s property in Tuchekoi, southeast of Gympie, Queensland.According toYahoo News , the family was left heartbroken.Kyan, who had a passion for classical music, was teaching himself classical piano in the months before his death - and unbeknownst to his parents, had started writing his own composition. Now, after finding an unfinished song in a blank notebook, his mother Amanda Bierley has started a campaign to bring his music to le ahead of his funeral - scheduled to take place on Sunday.She never got to hear his piece, but has appealed to musicians on Facebook to play what he has written and send the family a recording. In a post on Facebook, she said that Kyan was composing a piece which he had categorised as a “modern classical”. I never heard what he was composing. Is there anyone that can read music and play it and send it to us ” she asked. “It would mean the world to us to hear his composition. Kyan had wanted to be a concert pianist, Amanda said and had spent “every waking hour” on the piano he scraped and saved to buy. Speaking on BC radio, Amanda said the family was hoping the finished piece could offer “just a little insight” into Kyan’s mind. She said Kyan was “so much more than the way he died”, and said she wanted people to remember him for who he was in his short  years - “full of le, with a beautul mind”. In a tribute on Facebook, she said: He was diagnosed with Aspergers and ADHD and used that superpower to become an incredibly beautul and unique human who just wanted to learn and excel at everything he could, about everything there was.  Piano was his calling, he was , and had  months of learning, teaching himself music theory, performance and composition.” He had committed multiple classical pieces to memory, she said, as well as some modern pieces. However, she claimed he had only learned the modern pieces to lure in new listeners and educate them with the beauty of classical music. Amanda carried on to appeal for musicians to complete the music as Kyan had intended, with “repeated bits, a changed tempo and with light and shade”. He imagined it to be performed by wind and string instruments, and of course his beloved piano, she continued on Facebook. He would have been so chuffed that all these wonderful people are now playing his music. Little did he know he was actually composing his own funeral song.” Amanda’s Facebook post has attracted hundreds of responses and shares. The family have received some “lovely renditions”, Amanda said, but she continued to encourage anyone to contribute to his “beautul unfinished work” and hopes more come through before his funeral. She said she was “extremely humbled” by people’s responses, which had helped him see “beauty through adversity”. According to ABC reports, Kyan’s song would be performed and recorded by  members of the Queensland Symphony Orchestra, with the aim of having it complete for Sunday’s funeral.Meanwhile, a GoFundMe campaign has been launched by a family friend to help the beautul Pennell family out during this dficult time.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON ADHDAustralia\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ashmi, , and Diwakar, , speak to Sherpas who reveal how Everest is changing before their eyes... Few places on the planet can match the awe-inspiring beauty of the Himalayas, home to nine out of  of the world’s highest peaks.The mountain range is the natural world at its finest and most challenging, but beneath the shadows of Mount Everest is frightening evidence of the impact that the climate emergency is having on our planet.Sherpas of Nepal today warn how glaciers on Mount Everest are rapidly melting, making traversing the peak more dangerous and putting the lives of the people living below the mountain at risk. Kami Rita Sherpa, the world record holder for the most ascents to the summit of Everest, says that he is concerned about the future of the world’s highest peak as rising temperatures are causing glaciers and snow to disappear at alarming rates. “All the mountains are melting,” the Sherpa, who has reached the top of Mount Everest  times, says. “And the weather at the mountains is very unpredictable. Mountains are starting to be bare, as the once snow-covered rocks are only rocks now.”Photographs taken of Everest in May  and January  from the Tibet side of the mountain show a stark dference. In , scientists monitoring climate change in the region found the average melting rate has doubled over the past decade due to higher temperatures and decreased snowfall. Apa Sherpa, a former world record holder who ascended Everest  times before his retirement, witnessed the mountain disappearing before his own eyes.  “There was a big change compared to when I first climbed and my last climb,” he says. “When I first climbed, there was more snow and more ice, but it’s a lot more rocky now because of climate change.” He adds: “The glacier is getting lower and lower because it’s melting.” For Sherpas like Kami and Apa, who are charged with guiding tourists and carrying their equipment to the top of the ,-metre peak, global warming is making the climb even more dangerous. Without snow and ice holding rocks in place, Kami says “natural disasters like rockfalls and avalanches occur more frequently than in the old days.”  Apa recalls climbing in the s without a helmet but now mountaineers have to wear helmets because of the falling rocks. Climate campaigner Pemba Dorje Sherpa, who has also summited Everest  times and campaigns with Friends of the Earth, explains that one of the riskiest parts of the mountain is the notorious Khumbu icefall. An icefall is a steep part of a glacier, similar to a frozen waterfall. The Khumbu icefall is located above Everest’s base camp and is considered one of the most treacherous parts of the route to the top. In April , a column of ice collapsed there, causing an avalanche that killed  Sherpas.  “It’s getting riskier with increased climate change and global warming as the ice there melts because of the heat,” Pemba says. “Earlier, we used to start the climb at  to  am. Now, we have to start around  am to cross the iceberg before sunrise to avoid the risk of it melting.” A research team measuring ice temperatures on the Khumbu Glacier in  found that the ice was signicantly warmer than expected, with the coldest ice measuring -.°C – meaning it will be quicker to melt in the sun. As the snow melts, Sherpas have been horried to see bodies of past climbers emerging.  An estimated  people have died on Everest, a third of whom are Sherpas. “It is dangerous for every climber but the sherpas are the ones that take huge risks,” Kami says, explaining that they are responsible for “opening the routes ,carrying loads and preparing for the clients.” He adds: “Nobody recognizes the responsibility and the struggles that Sherpas face during the expedition.” But unlike Western tourists seeking adventure, many Sherpas have no choice but to make the climb in order to earn a wage to feed their families. Nepal’s mountain tourist industry contributed millionto the economy in . “I wanted to get an education and become a doctor,” Apa says. “But unfortunately when I was , my father passed away. Then I had no choice, I had to support my family. So then I became a porter and trekking guide.”  Kami also became a mountaineer out of necessity rather than choice. “I had the responsibility of looking after my family and was not very financially stable at that moment. Being from a poor family background, the only source of income was mountaineering.” Apa says: “Our Sherpa people, we have no education. So we have to climb, even though it’s risky. That’s why more of our people die on Everest than the Western people, the European people.  “Because the Sherpas have no choice and the Sherpas have to do everything - fixing the ropes, taking the clients to the top, bringing them down, we have to go through the icefall - times.” The people living in Everest’s foothills are also suffering the effects of the melting mountain. Pemba says that people in his community live in fear of the nearby lakes bursting as they fill with melted ice from the glaciers. “If the Tsho Rolpa lake bursts, my village will be swept away in  minutes,” he says. The lake, which is one of Nepal’s largest glacial lakes, sits at an altitude of , metres.  Although the government has taken steps to prevent it from bursting, there is still a risk of an outburst. Apa recalls his own home being destroyed by a glacial lake flood in . “One of the lakes nearby my house burst. Everything was gone. Not only my land, but all my neighbour’s too. “All the land is gone. We don’t know how many people died in the lowlands, how many animals died in the lowlands, we never knew.”  Bursting lakes have become more of a threat in recent years. In , scientists found marked acceleration in the rate of lake growth on top of glaciers across the Everest region. Three years prior, Nepal’s army drained Imja Lake near Everest after the water reached dangerously high levels from rapid glacial-melt.Waste and rubbish from climbing expeditions also ends up in these lakes as the ice melts, contaminating drinking water. Apa established the Eco-Everest expedition in , which attempts to help clean the mountain of rubbish left by former climbers. In , the group held their biggest clean-up, gathering  empty oxygen bottles from the peak, some of which had been there since the s. “Human waste was on the mountain everywhere,” Apa remembers, “but as the snow melts and the water comes down, the people who live in the lowlands have to drink the water.” Despite the risks, adventure-seekers continue to trek to the world’s tallest peak – between  to , more than , climbers attempted to summit Everest. A  video went viral as it showed a traffic jam forming at the bottom of the Khumbu icefall, with hundreds of climbers queuing to ascend the mountain. But as the climate emergency worsens, Sherpas are worried about the future of their mountain and the ever-growing dangers of climbing it. “If we do not seek climate justice now, everything will be finished,” Pemba says. The Daily Mirror’s NextGen International project builds on the success of our UK initiative, where we gave young people a voice and published the stories that matter to them. Now the project has gone global, focusing on the climate emergency and empowering young people in six countries to tell their stories of how they have been affected by the crisis.Countries taking part in the project are Nigeria, Nicaragua, the Solomon Islands, Brazil, Nepal and Mongolia.The project was originally working with a group of six teenagers in Kabul, Afghanistan, with our charity partner Save the Children. Midway through the project in August, Kabul fell to the Taliban and it was no longer safe for the young people to continue. Afghanistan was chosen because it is one of the countries most affected by climate change in the world.It is hugely regrettable the project was unable to complete in the country but the safety of the young people involved was paramount. The Mirror was awarded funding from the European Development Journalism Grants, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  “And there will be nothing left for the next generation. If this continues, our grandchildren won’t see the mountains.” Rachel Kennerley, international climate campaigner at Friends of the Earth, adds: “Natural wonders like The Himalayas have awe-struck people since time immemorial. It’s hard to imagine a world where they don’t exist, but sites such as these are increasingly threatened by unchecked climate breakdown. “Sadly, it’s not just landscapes which could be lost, but also the rich history attached to them, the culture entwined with their existence, and the lives and livelihoods that rely on them thriving. “Halting the worst of climate breakdown is still within bounds. The world’s leaders could learn so much from the natural world in overcoming adversity and achieving the seemingly impossible, which is everything Everest has come to symbolise.”To find out how you can help, visit www.savethechildren.org.uk how-you-can-help emergencies climate-crisisRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Apa SherpaClimate changeWorld recordsNextGen SeriesMount EverestDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Want all the stories that matter to you delivered straight to your inbox for our Mirror Together newsletterSign UpInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Owner OKG said the plan was to fix the problem in April during the plantaposs annual review, but on further assessment the decision was made to halt electricity production for nine days. This will begin on February . The damage does not pose any risks to people or the environment, the firm said. The reactor, which has been supplying  MW since , is more powerful than the two decommissioned reactors also at the site put together. A company spokesperson told SVT Småland : We estimate that the reactor will be out of production for nine days until February .Oskarshamn  is one of Swedenaposs six operating nuclear reactors. The O was first built for MW, but it was first expanded to , and most recently in  to  MW.  Last year, the reactor broke production records with ,, MWh. Meanwhile, the R reactor at Ringhals nuclear power plant, situated on Swedenaposs Värö Peninsula, also suffered problems and had to be stopped multiple times earlier this winter. The plantaposs other two units, which produce boiling and pressurised water, respectively, and date back to the s and s, are to be cut up and disposed of as early as April , according to owners Westinghouse.  For the reactor internals, engineers will use mechanical underwater remote-controlled equipment, the company said last year in a statement. It comes after the prosecutor leading an investigation into drones being sighted at Swedenaposs three nuclear plants last month said there is no evidence foreign powers were involved, according to publicly funded Swedish Radio. Police in Sweden deployed patrols and helicopters in mid-January to the Forsmark nuclear plant to hunt for a drone seen flying over the site but were unable to catch the unmanned vehicle. Drones were also observed at Oskarshamn and Ringhals. Forsmark and Ringhals are run by state-owned Vattenfall while Oskarshamn is operated by German energy company Uniper SE. The three nuclear plants account for around % of Swedenaposs total power production. The Mirror has contacted Uniper SE for comment in relation to the shutdown.

and had a good chance to score when Robertson freed John McCallum to play in Andrew Renton.Renton advanced on the left side of the box, but the youngster#s touch when bearing down on goal was just on the heavy side, and allowed the keeper to lunge at his feet and collect the ball at the last moment.Kilsyth made it -

It was the Pupils who would concede it.In another move tinged with disappointment # the match referee failing to spot another offside in the build-up # a ball from the right flank was swung in to a player in an offside position, who held the ball up and worked it back to a central area where Finnart’s captain unleashed a strong strike high into the Pupils’ net.And while the Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils continued to work hard to claw their way back into the match they were undone with only a few minutes remaining by a smart counter-attack at the other end, which allowed Finnart’s number  to score from close range with a low, side-footed effort.On reflection, the Pupils were undone by moments of business-like quality – certainly for goals two and four from their hosts # and perhaps their own naivety against a canny and disciplined side who are challenging to win the WoSFL’s Division Four.Nevertheless, the Pupils can reflect on a decent, determined performance for much of this match.

This includes extensive information provided on the building’s energy and sustainability, which led to planning permission being granted.\"We have committed to providing a low carbon and sustainable nursery building in a - learning campus that supports the local community and provides a healthy and resilient natural environment for the future. This is in line with our Climate Change Strategy.“The development will offer learners, staff and the community all the benefits of moving from an older, much less energy-efficient building to a new, more sustainable, high-quality, purpose-built facility with multiple access routes to encourage sustainable travel.“The nursery building’s orientation within that campus of north  south is also very important. The main building access is orientated to the south from Old Haddington Road to allow ease of access for those with additional support needs, as well as addressing the close relationship to the main primary school building, of which the nursery is a part.“Energy efficiency has been considered carefully throughout the building’s design and specication and we aim to combine this with sustainable building practices and reduce emissions where possible throughout the construction.”The new nursery, which will have capacity for  children over two sessions, has an open-plan design, with a mezz- anine area and separate quiet room.The contract value of the nursery is £. million, with a further £, due to be spent on internal fittings.North of the site, a three-classroom extension for secondary-school pupils is being built on the south-west side of North Berwick High School.This £. million project, due to be completed next autumn, will house new home economics, modern languages and social studies classrooms for the high school."},{"url":null,"title":"pmqs-today-watch-live-stream-scotland","story":"Earlier this week Keir Starmer was mobbed by protestors yelling Saville slurs.Johnson had previously ly claimed the opposition leader “used his time prosecuting journalists and failing to prosecute Jimmy Savile” while Director of Public Prosecutions.After the incident occurred, Johnson tweeted the “behaviour directed” at the Labour leader was “absolutely disgraceful”.

highlight the project, amid concern by Musselburgh and District Angling Clubabout the issue of mine water discharge, fearing it was having “a negative effect on the fish and invertebrate communities in the South Esk”.These concerns predate the recent pollution incident in the River Esk last month.Residents who attended the Coal Authority sessions heard more details about the plans for the treatment scheme at Dalkeith, which will remove iron and manganese from water flowing from a historical drainage tunnel adjacent to Newmills Road, known locally as Junkies Adit.The tunnel is linked tothe extensive underground coal mine workings in the Midlothian area.In recent years, the amount of mine water discharging from Junkies Adit has been increasing and the water quality has been deteriorating, the Coal Authority said.The organisation explained that the water affected was visibly orange, which was a result of naturally occurring iron dissolving in the mine water underground, which then became solid as it mixed with air and settled out of the water.In recent years, the discolouration has become more visible further downstream and could affect the river’s ecologyleft untreated, the Coal Authority added.The Coal Authority has been working with the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyand other partners to monitor the problem and develop a solution.Details for planning approval will be submitted shortly, with a view to starting the main construction later this year.More detailed design work will be done in the coming months to develop the scheme, and residents and stakeholders will have the chance to provide feedback as the designs progress.John Batty, Coal Authority project manager, said: “I think a lot of residents are keen to see this project progress as the river is so visibly orange as a result of the mine water, and the negative impact on the wildle and ecology is widely known.“The mine workings are complex so it has taken many years to get to this point.“We have been working to carry out studies and investigations, evaluate potential solutions and establish water quality by taking water samples on a regular basis through the challenges of the pandemic.“We have undertaken research using a test treatment scheme on site last spring that provided a large amount of information to feed into the designs.”Paul Butler, SEPA mining sector lead, said: “We are pleased that the progress we have made together has enabled the Coal Authority to provide information on the proposals for a new mine water treatment scheme at the site of Junkies Adit.”Colin Beattie, MSP for Midlothian North and Musselburgh, said: “I think it is important that the public are involved with the process and it is vital public engagement continues as the scheme progresses.“I look forward to seeing the next stages of the treatment scheme and working with the Coal Authority, SEPA and the local community on this project.”Steven Dalgleish, of MDAA, said: “No faulting the Coal Authority’s commitment to the cause but the association remains gravely concerned that funding may not appear for this project.“From some of our own research, it seems that this may remain an issue for over  years, leaving the South Esk between Dalkeith and its junction with the North Esk effectively dead and useless as the main salmon and sea trout spawning bed area it once was.”"},{"url":null,"title":"day-today-prestonpans-shut-due-covid-energy-price-rises","story":"Thanks from the East Lothian community have been shared across social media following the news that Day-Today – also know locally as Ashiq’s – is to close.A number of factors have contributed to owner Ferhan Ashiq’s decision to close his Redburn Road shop for good on February .Ferhan told the Courier that “the writing on the wall” came when Covid struck the county two years ago.This coincided with a serious burn injury to Ferhan and we Hira’s youngest son which put “stress on the business, with hours reduced to take care of him”.Additionally, Ferhan confirmed that the Day-Today store was also facing a huge surge in electric costs – a rise from £, per year to £, – which he said was an “insurmountable” price, putting the business in an “untenable situation”.He added: “With the costs of goods rising as it was, in good conscience could I really be asking the people of Prestonpans to be paying more for their products “I saw the writing on the wall – their own energy pricing will be going up and,anything, they will be needing to make their money go as far as possible, so we as a family decided we will leave before we are pushed.”Energy price rises for homes and businesses will continue after Ofgem announced that average energy bills will increase by £ from April – a rise of  per cent.Pandemic isolation rules put further pressure on staff and the Ashiq family.Ferhan added: “Running a store of that size is quite an undertaking: you end up working -hour days, seven days a week for three years, no holidays, no breaks.“Isolation measures put pressure on staff members covering other shts and working much harder.”Thanking the Prestonpans community, the shop owner said: “Our family is so thankful to everyone who helped us achieve what we have in Prestonpans for the last  years.“This business put myself and my sister through education and we both went to university off the back of it, and that could never have happenedthe community hadn’t shopped in our store.“I went to school with a lot of customers and I’m watching their kids grow up and become friends with my kids.”It has been confirmed that Day-Today has been sold and will “never be a convenience store again” – the new owner and business will not be revealed until March .The Ashiq family plans to stay in Prestonpans for the foreseeable future, while the family’s Levenhall Village Store in Musselburgh will remain open.Ferhan said: “I am looking to devote more time to my lovely we Hira, who has stood by me all these years throughout all the hardships, and my young children Harris, Niall and Daniel.”The alleged theft from the premises was reported to police, who are understood to be investigating the

Though Scotlands weather is reasonably mild, a fall to below zero degrees isnt a rare occurrence during winter – so lets take a look at what happens to your EV when it does.Can I drive my EV in cold weather Off the bat, should you drive an electric car in cold weather  Of course, you should. Electric cars go through the same rigorous testing procedures as petrol and diesel cars, so you neednt be afraid of piloting your EV in colder temperatures.Many electric cars are driven specically through arctic conditions to ensure that theyre able toproperly even in the harshest of conditions.So how can cold weather affect my electric car The changes youll notice surround the battery and the amount of range you get. Batteries use a chemical reaction to take on and release energy and its this process that is slowed down during cold weather. Its why electric cars offer their best possible battery performance in warmer weather, when this process can work in its most effective window.What does this mean  Essentially, you wont get as much range as you might in warmer temperatures. You could see up to a % loss in range, though for many cars this reduction will be around % of the claimed range.Is there anything I can do to help Of course. There are a few things you can do to boost the range of your electric car during colder temperatures. For instance, you could try covering your car – either with a plastic cover or within a garage – which will help to bring its temperature up.In addition, you could use your electric cars preconditioning system to warm the cars interior up ahead of time, so you dont have to rely on its battery to do this.When charging, most electric cars give you the option to pre-set a time and temperature for your car. For instance, you could set it to warm the cabin up to  degrees at am before you leave, ensuring its toasty warm but through using the cabled electricity instead of the battery. Though some cars will allow you to pre-condition without plugging in, this will draw more energy from the battery and leave you with less charge from the off.Are manufacturers doing anything to help EVs in cold weather Absolutely. A lot of EV manufacturers are now fitting their cars with heat pumps as a way of getting the very best from them during colder weather. Theyre used to warm the cars cabin more efficiently. They work by using thermal energy to turn a liquid refrigerant into a gas, which then leads to a rise in temperature. Because this is using less energy to heat up passing air, it helps to extend the cars range. Essentially, its the reverse of how your fridge works at home.Many electric cars are using this method at the moment, including Polestars  and the Volkswagen ID..What about charging  Is that affected by cold weather too Theres a chance that cold weather could affect public charging speeds. These charge points use a similar transition of power to the batteries inside your electric car, so theres a good chance that youll notice a slight change in how quickly you can charge.Plus, the rate of charge you get during colder temperatures will also depend on how cold your cars battery is. This affects how quickly it can accept a charge."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-independence-debate-faith","story":"It immediately becomes clear,not already self-evident, that Scotland choosing to be a sovereign state once again will not be an easy path, but nothing worth achieving ever is.Your correspondent Brian Higginsraises an important point in his letter: “… a Yes vote is not a vote for Nicola Sturgeon, or even a vote for the SNP, but a choice for self-determination”. This brings sharply into focus comments in the articles by Tom Gordon and Alex Neil regarding an EU referendum in Scotland. As an EU Remainer, I believe an independence referendum must only be that and cannot be taken as a de facto referendum on joining the EU. It would be completely undemocratic to do so and would disenfranchise those in Scotland who voted for Brexit – not a good start for a new country.If Scotland votes Yes to independence what exactly happens next  Only then can the people decide what type of country they want. During quite a y transition period, parties who previously opposed independence will reform with their prospectuses for the new Scotland and new parties will appear. The constitutional issue will be gone and it will be the very first time all parties will be focused only on what is good for Scotland and our continuing close relationship with the rest of the UK. Will the SNP hold together as a party given the glue of independence will have melted to reveal cracks in the structure  It cannot be assumed the existing devolved SNP Government will be solely leading negotiations with the UK. During transition, will there be a coalition government in Scotland comprised of existing political parties or will there be a Scottish general election The current independence debate tends to focus on the economic case because that is where there is vulnerability which is readily exploited by those who oppose Scottish independence. The truth is the economic case for independence cannot be compared to the status quo. It is fact against prediction – a prediction that can be tailored to any viewpoint. We have the resources, we have the people, have faith in yourself and others. Independence is about self-determination, doing it for yourself, proud of your country as a sovereign state taking its place at the world table, not sharing it as a minnow constantly hidden by a larger partner.Alan M Morris, Blanefield.A POSITION OF STRENGTHSEVERAL unionist correspondentsrelish whipping up fear about pensions in an independent Scotland. Three points must be made.First, the UK Government has affirmed its legal obligation to pay pensions regardless of where one lives. The Fraser of Allander Institute confirms this: “UK Government pays state pensions to those who retire abroad . Thereforethe UK Government pays the state pension to an inidual living in France, it would seem inconsistent for it not to pay the state pension to an inidual with a similar NICs record living in an independent Scotland.” It goes on to say that it is NICs, not citizenship, that determines eligibility.Second, Scotland will be negotiating from a position of strength when iding state assets and liabilities. Scotland won’t be liable for the £ billion UK debt. Scotland produces more than  per cent of UK oil and gas, the majority of renewable electricity and has % of the UK’s fresh water. It would be in rUK’s interests to negotiate in good faith.Third, post-independence, the Scottish Government will guarantee state pensions in the new Scottish currency and will have the power to increase pension payments, currently the lowest in the OECD, which it doesn’t have as a UK region.With independence, Scots will have a democratically elected government answerable to them, not a distant foreign government they didn’t vote for that ignores them. Who should they trust more Leah Gunn Barrett, Edinburgh.LIES ABOUT OUR WEALTHTHE slew of fearmongering letters about pensions in an independent Scotland ignores a basic fact.Since  Scotland has contributed more to the UK economy than England, Wales or Northern Ireland. And that was well before the North Sea oil boom. The UK Treasury and British Establishment have consistently lied to Scotland about its true wealth – although there have been some slips. In  Chief Treasury Secretary William Waldegrave admitted that Scotland had paid a massive £ billion more to the London Exchequer than it had got back since the Tories came to power in .In , with New Labour in power, the House of Commons Library produced a table showing Scotland would rank seventh in the world’s wealth league as measured by GDP per head, and the UK would rank th.In , the Daily Mail, hardly a cheerleader for Scottish independence, detailed in “Who are the real subsidy junkies ” how much more money per head UK regions got from the Treasury than they paid in tax. Northern Island got £,, North-east England £,, Wales £,, North-west England £,, Southwest England £, West Midlands £, East Midlands £. Scotland was last at £.In May  Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling conceded that Scotland’s oil revenue had been underwriting the UK’s budget deficit for decades.Lacking rational arguments, the Unionists simply rely on platitudinous smears.Carter Thomson, Craighouse, Isle of Jura.TIME INDYREF WAS PUT TO BEDTHE cat is certainly out of the bag now with regards to pension rights should the Scottish electorate ever swallow the nationalists propaganda and vote to leave the UK.It is now clear beyond any doubt that in an independent Scotland there should be no automatic assumption that the state pension would be at least at the same value as it is presently as part of the Union. The old hoary chestnut quoting Sir Steve Webb in  has been brought up to date and makes dire reading for the separatists, as of course pension payments are not part of some historic pot but in fact are paid from taxation received in the present.It is actually quite amusing that an SNP spokesperson still quotes Sir Steves  view that after independence people would be entitled to the pension contributions and this is the basis of their belief today.I recall that also in  the SNP confirmed thatit lost the referendum, which of course thank goodness it did, then that would be it settled for a generation, yet rather than honouring this and concentrating on governing the country in a competent manner, it never accepted the decision of the people of Scotland and immediately embarked on the Indyref campaign.No amount of spin or fake news will dig the nationalists out of this pensions hole and hopefully this will put the whole dreadful idea of another referendum being imposed on us any time soon to bed.James Martin, Bearsden.FALSE ACCLAIM FOR JOHNSONSIR Tom Hunterhas an enviable reputation as a business leader and as a person with a real concern for society. It is dficult to disagree with his headline statement, indeed for anyone with a modicum of decency, it is hard to imagine a time when an amoral chancer like Boris Johnson should have gained the power he has. However, Sir Tom seems to have fallen for the spin that Mr Johnson somehow did a wonderful job in the pandemic, particularly with regard to vaccination.Laying aside Mr Johnsons vacillation and  exceptionalism in the early stages of the pandemic, which probably resulted in the unnecessary deaths of thousands, his claim to have made a success of vaccination rings very hollow. All he did was take a chance with the lives of millions by its early approval and throw public moneyinto the roll-out of the vaccine. The real heroes of this saga are the scientists and NHS staff who worked incredible hours actually to design and administer it.They were rewarded with meaningless clapping and a derisory pay award.Mr Johnson, in the meantime, was also throwing our money to his cronies for often-useless PPI equipment or services.Let us have no more of this  acclamation.Dr RM Morris, Ellon.Read more: Why should we Scots jump off a clf into the unknown "},{"url":null,"title":"letters-high-time-got-away-notion-boy-jobs-girl-jobs","story":"Only five per cent of the UK’s pilots are female and a couple of my former colleagues argue that’s because there are \"boy jobs and girl jobs\" a sad echo of something Theresa May said about putting out the bins. But career choices are far more important than domestic arrangements, and flying is an attractive career, so why do so few young women aspire to it There’s little doubt that a lot of it comes down to the way children are conditioned when young. Girls are encouraged to be yielding and in the background, as in the old saying \"behind every successful man there is a woman\". Boys are encouraged to push themselves forward, as in Primark’s slogans on their boyswear: “Go for it” and “Born to win”. And children going on holiday, or watching a movie, will see that pilots are almost always men, and white men at that.There are plenty of parents and organisations that encourage girls and boys equally to be themselves and choose their own path, but there are also constant little nudges suggesting that some behaviours are appropriate for one sex, but not for the other, and that there are indeed boy jobs and girl jobs. If we’re to allow our youngsters genuine choice from the range of all available careers, we’ve got to get away from this indoctrination, which includes Primark’s sexist sloganeering for girls.I spent  years as a pilot with BA and  before that in the RAF, the last three as a Qualied Flying Instructor. In my experience, the female pilots I flew with were, on average, better aviators than their male counterparts. I suspect that was because they had to be better to overcome the many hurdles and biases their male colleagues never faced. So here’s a slogan for Primark to put on their sweaters: “Women make better pilots”.Doug Maughan, Dunblane.WELCOME PROGRESS ON CANNABIDIOLI WAS delighted to read that the Scottish Medicines Consortium, independent of the SNP Government, has licensed Epidyolexfor use in the treatment of tuberous sclerosis complex, a condition that is rare but massively debilitating for sufferers . Well done to you for placing the story on your front page.Notwithstanding, this is in my opinion what might be considered as a baby step in the slow progress that is being made, and must continue, in the battle to make researched and evidence-based cannabis and other \"illegal\" substances available in the treatment of health-related conditions, including mental health. Recent YouGov polls indicate that more than . million patients in the UK are currently consuming cannabis to help manage their diagnosed medical conditions. A further . million adult patients would like to discuss cannabis-based treatment options with their doctor.We should take a grown-up public health approach towards all drugs that are evidence-based and outcomes-focused. This could deliver an intended consequence in erting resources away from prosecution and enforcement and towards prevention to keep everyone safer.Douglas McBean, Edinburgh.REMEMBER ANOTHER TIMELESS TREASUREI WAS very interested in your report about the work to repair and preserve the Queen Mary and was heartened to find therein an attitude of preserving heritage wherever possible . The Clyde-built sailing ship Falls of Clyde, currently in Honolulu, is another very special vessel deserving preservation, although of a completely dferent character and history. She too is a “timeless treasure”.Having visited her there and been immensely impressed by the skill and care that had restored her to her original glory, with help from Sir William Lithgow, I fell completely in love with her and was delighted to find that plans, by a group called Falls of Clyde International, are well advanced to bring her back to her birthplace. The intention is not simply to have another “museum exhibit”, but to fit her with green power and even set her sailing again to earn her keep on Fairtrade routes and by training apprentices and those who wish to experience the old ways of sailing. Other income streams are also planned.Just recently, I came across an article in a glossy magazine headed “The Five Lives of a Grand Old Lady” about Falls of Clyde, with old sepia photographs taken by her second mate. It explains the five lives that Falls had which make her unique – British trader, Hawaiian sugar transport, conversion to a tanker with steam power, floating filling station for ships and finally, restoration for the Bishop Maritime Museum in Honolulu.Now she has the chance of a sixth le, back in her birthplace, an icon of our heritage linked to an active, income-generating, green future. This must be the perfect example of what I recently heard called “green re-industrialisation\". I too believe that “you don’t sink history”, and have seen too much bulldozed in my long le.Information on her and the plans can be found on the website foci.scot.L McGregor, Falkirk.THE FATE OF SCOTLANDS ELIZABETHAS another amateur historian I feel the need to respond to Tom Irvine’s letterin which he states that Robert the Bruce’s second we, Elizabeth de Burgh, was captured near Kildrummy by Edward I’s forces. In fact Elizabeth was taken into captivity in Tain, Easter Ross, which is a considerable distance from Kildrummy.Queen Elizabeth had sought sanctuary in the church of Saint Duthac along with Bruce’s two sisters, his daughter from his first marriage Marjorie, and the Countess of Buchan.The Earl of Ross captured them there and then handed them over to the English. They were then sent to Edward I at Lanercost Priory to decide what their fate should be.Graham Sutherland, Edinburgh.ALE FELLOW WELL METFOLLOWING on from the recent Napoleonic palindrome , I remember a friend, after imbibing more alcohol than was sensible, saying to me: “Regal was I ere I saw lager”.Brian Logan, Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"wordle-236-todays-wordle-february-10-hints","story":"The aim of the game is to find a  letter word in only six attempts.The game uses the same rules as Scrabble, where only real words are allowed both in guesses and the result.If you get a letter in the right spot and form the correct word, the square turns green.Butthe guessed letter is in the word but not in the right spot, the square turns yellow.Letters that are wrong turn grey to help the process of elimination for the six tries.If you’re still trying to save your streak, then don’t scroll down yet, maybe some hints will send you on your way.Today’s word starts with the letter P and ends with the letter E.It contains  vowels.It means to stop momentarily.You need to run to the bathroom, so you do this to your show while you are out of the room.If you have given up on today’s game, then we can save you the misery.

Does the minister agree with me that the UK Shared Prosperity Fund should be the source of replacement funding for organisations like EMEC, that no longer have access to Interreg funding  And what#s the Scotland Office doing to make that case within Government ”Responding for the government, Iain Stewart MP, Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Scotland said:“I#m very pleased to say that I had the pleasure of visiting Stromness last summer, and saw for myself the huge potential that Orkney has to lead the country in renewable energy. I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere. Consistent support through EU funding has reaped idends for our community and for the country as a whole.

It is dficult to put a date on it when it is going to happen, but hopefully in a few weeks’ time it is going to look well.“It takes some time to get the football fitness, the condition-wise is good.🏡 Welcome, @ChrisEriksen#BrentfordFC #EriksenJoins pic IENTsFtbw— Brentford FCFebruary , “I have done a lot of running and a lot of tests, so the condition is good. The football touch is something of course you get in games, but of course to get there is still a few more weeks.“At the moment, when the coach sees me fit and wants me to play then I’ll be able.

I thank her for her role protecting the public and making our streets safer.— Boris JohnsonFebruary , Prime Minister Boris Johnson also praised the outgoing commissioner for serving with “great dedication and distinction over many decades”.“I thank her for her role protecting the public and making our streets safer,” he tweeted.Home Secretary Priti Patel said Dame Cressida “held the role during challenging times” and “exemplied the increasingly erse nature of our police” as the first woman to hold the post.“She would be the first to say that she has held the role during challenging times yet for nearly five years she has undertaken her duties with a steadfast dedication to protecting our capital city and its people, including during the unprecedented period of the pandemic,” Ms Patel said.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also thanked her, but added “a change of leadership in the Met is long overdue”.He also demanded that Mr Johnson “publicly recuse” himself over the appointment of her successor due to the ongoing Met investigation into parties held in No  during Covid restrictions.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

However, the Prime Minister — currently on a charm offensive as part of a mission to restore his reputation — has said he expects the last domestic rules in England could end earlythe data permits. Boris Johnson made the announcement on Wednesday, as Robin Swann was still waiting for an expert assessment on whether he can press ahead with lting restrictions in Northern Ireland.Read MoreRobin Swann has ‘no plans’ to ditch Covid testing and isolation rules in NIEarlier this week, the Health Minister told a press briefing that he wants to lt most, “ not all” remaining measures. Key to all of this, however, is the legal and public health advice he receives. It is understood that even as late as Wednesday night he hadn’t been given the green light to press ahead with relaxations and it isn’t entirely clear what this will entaillawyers tell him he has the power to act without Executive approval. If this proves to be the case, Mr Swann then has to decide which restrictions he will lt.Among the rules that remain are the controversial Covid certicate scheme for nightclubs, a minimum self-isolation period for people who test positive, a legal requirement to wear face coverings in indoor public spaces, and the regular use of lateral flow tests. Given Mr Johnson’s comments on Wednesday, there was hope that Mr Swann would follow suit, but a spokeswoman from the Department of Health on Wednesday night poured cold water on any such suggestion. “There are no immediate plans for changes to the current arrangements for testing, contact tracing and isolation in Northern Ireland,” she said. “All aspects of test and trace are kept under active review.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up However, while this may be Mr Swann’s preferred position, his hands may be forced on the matterMr Johnson scraps lateral flow testsin England. To date, NI’s supply has come from England and it will be dficult for the UUP minister to make a case to the public that they should pay for LFTs as it is unlikely Westminster will pay outthey aren’t in use across the water. The only other alternative would be for Stormont to pick up the cost — and given the current political instability, it’s anyone’s guess whether that would even be possible.As it stands, Covid- is still re in Northern Ireland.Given current testing arrangements, the actual number of positive cases is likely to be signicantly higher than those on the Department of Health’s dashboard. Realistically, how many people are actually recording positive LFT results Mercully, Omicron has not turned out to be as dangerous as first feared — at least to most people. But there are still tens of thousands of people here who are clinically extremely vulnerable and for whom the vaccinations may not provide effective protection.Many have had to shield and make extraordinary sacrices to stay safe over the past two years.

It’s booming because it makes sense,” he said.“It’s the way the world is going and technology is through the roof now. There’s money in everything andyou don’t get up to date with these things, you’re going to get left behind.“People used to say, ‘why would you sit and watch people play video games ’ Well, why would you sit and watch someone kick a ball  That’s entertainment for you and there are dferent perspectives on it.”Huge names have jumped on the esports bandwagon in recent years, with David Beckham becoming co-owner of London-based team Guild Esports, and Will Smith investing m into global gaming organisation, Gen.G.In , global market researcher Newzoo estimated that worldwide revenues from competitive gaming were just shy of over bn, with nearly  million viewers.“It can be supported from anywhere in the world through YouTube and social media,” added Mr McAllister.“It’s so marketable. Esports is like cryptocurrency in that it’s still in its infancy and it’s very underdeveloped over here, but across Europe, the US and Asia, it’s quite big and people have started to realise this.“It’s the same principle as a sports team, but a football club can only play football. I can have so many teams that are from anywhere and are so dferent. We have a team at the minute that are all European. It’s about networking.“Big companies have now started making dedicated esports facilities where you can train and create YouTube accounts. I have a similar plan for a place I’d like to open in Belfast some day.”Mr McAllister also noted that esports can offer multiple career opportunities outside of pro players. He said there’s a need for graphic designers, analysts, videographers, coaches and managers.He hopes that the publicity around esports’ introduction to the Commonwealth Games, which take place in Birmingham from July -August , will provide an even bigger boost to the local gaming industry in Northern Ireland.“There are so many dferent avenues and our job is to try to support people. We want to keep this momentum going locally and keep getting support. Obviously we’re very small, but we have big ambitions and aspirations,” he said.Belfast Storm competed in the international Northern League of Legends Championship last year, which saw players face teams from across Europe.The team has also been working with Gscience, a Bangor-based start-up that helps gamers look after their health. Its founder, Ryan Scollan, combined his background in sports science with his love of gaming as he noticed that interest in esports has dramatically increased.Mr  McAllister emphasised that a large part of attracting people to esports is helping them “get away from the perspective of gamers that are overweight and unfit”.He added: “Gamers at a high level are very well looked after. They have nutritional coaches and go to the gym. Traditionally, gaming would have been maybe  hours a day, but we are now trying to focus on changing that to get it down to six hours a day and encourage gamers to stay active where.”The CGF committee said it hopes that by the  Commonwealth Games, esports will be a full, permanent event.Esports is also making its debut at this year#s Asian Games, which are governed by the Olympic Council of Asia, with games such as League of Legends, EA Sports Fa and DOTA  all being featured.The International Olympic Committee gave its support to the first-ever “Olympic Virtual Series” of esports events in the lead-up to the Tokyo Games, but said the  Olympics are “premature” to include competitive gaming as an official category.However, the door is open for esports to become an Olympic sport in , when the summer games will be hosted in Los Angeles.The Global Esports Federation has said the event at this year#s Commonwealth Games will feature renowned multi-genre global titles, which will be announced next month.Most ReadMystery over £bn school fund that ‘no one checked on for years’ aimed at helping NI pupils from socially deprived backgroundsFamous London restaurant The Ivy to open eaterie in Belfast city centreNightride: Thriller filmed in Belfast snapped up by NetflixFamily#s tribute following tragic death of QUB student Conall McGuinness - ‘It was a pleasure to have had him for the  years we did’Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allister to address anti-protocol rally in DromoreTop VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominationsPlayAssisi animal sanctuary ‘blown away’ by support after online dog fostering call following noise complaintPlayJohn Kyle explains why he#s chosen the UUPLatest Northern IrelandSwann seeks ministers’ input over Covid relaxations after legal adviceKill protocol or the Union is finished, TUV chief tells rallyPolice Federation chief Mark Lindsay: #Officers being spat on, assaulted and vilied feel there is no political support for what they do# Protocol is biggest threat to union in a generation, DUP leader warnsSinn Fein leader congratulates Queen on ‘letime of service’LatestSwann seeks ministers’ input over Covid relaxations after legal adviceCheer star Jerry Harris pleads guilty to US child pornography chargesBritish museum hails discovery of pre-historic artMet Police ‘partygate’ probe to continue as normalLiverpool not yet in position to turn up heat on Man City, says Jurgen Klopp,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

And while this semi-autobiographical film is about the Troubles and the effect it had on the people who lived here, it#s also about how le went on regardless and people tried to make the best of things - going to school, visiting grandparents, worrying about brown envelopes - in one of the most authentic aspects of the film.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The telling of the story through the eyes of Buddy, an innocent child, adds crucial objectivity and a view of things through the eyes of someone without the cynicism of adults or the need to weigh up the options like his parents. Instead, he#s more worried about his fondness for his classmate and how whatever turn his le takes may affect her and their relationship.Buddy#s grandfather, played by the inimitable Ciaran Hinds, listens to him talk about his crush and schools him on the topic of love while Pa, played by Jamie Dornan, has to listen to a local heavyweight who threatens the family#s safety. later, Buddy worries thatthe family moves away, his accent won#t be understood. He is assured: If they can#t understand you, then they#re not listening.It#s a wider point, made to ying degrees throughout the film, about how best to relate to each other and while not the whole picture, plays into the broad brush subjectivity that means Belfast can be enjoyed by all.Read MoreBelfast: Branagh’s ode to city goes up against western hit The Power Of The Dog at the OscarsWill it be seventh heaven for Branagh this time at Oscars Most ReadMystery over £bn school fund that ‘no one checked on for years’ aimed at helping NI pupils from socially deprived backgroundsFamous London restaurant The Ivy to open eaterie in Belfast city centreNightride: Thriller filmed in Belfast snapped up by NetflixFamily#s tribute following tragic death of QUB student Conall McGuinness - ‘It was a pleasure to have had him for the  years we did’Sir Jeffrey Donaldson and Jim Allister to address anti-protocol rally in DromoreTop VideosPlayVideo: Ciarán Hinds has his name mispronounced during this year#s Oscar nominationsPlayAssisi animal sanctuary ‘blown away’ by support after online dog fostering call following noise complaintPlayJohn Kyle explains why he#s chosen the UUPLatest Northern IrelandKill protocol or the Union is finished, TUV chief tells rallyPolice Federation chief Mark Lindsay: #Officers being spat on, assaulted and vilied feel there is no political support for what they do# Protocol is biggest threat to union in a generation, DUP leader warnsSinn Fein leader congratulates Queen on ‘letime of service’Murphy seeking to bring budget directly to Assembly, says O’NeillLatestCheer star Jerry Harris pleads guilty to US child pornography chargesBritish museum hails discovery of pre-historic artMet Police ‘partygate’ probe to continue as normalLiverpool not yet in position to turn up heat on Man City, says Jurgen KloppI want explanations – Mikel Arteta fumes at Gabriel Martinelli red card,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Stormont, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said unionists were tired of the “disrespect” of their culture.He said: “Well the Assembly Commission has taken this decision and it is regrettable that the Finance Ministerpreviously indicated that he was not prepared to agree to a tree being planted in the grounds of Stormont to mark Her Majesty’s Platinum Jubilee.“I welcome the fact that the Assembly Commission has now decided that a tree may be planted, that is a good thing.“But I think unionists are tired of the lack of respect for our tradition, our culture, our identity, and they want to see an end to this disrespect.”Permission was granted by the Assembly Commission this week for the tree planting.The commission, made up of representatives of the main Stormont parties, has responsibility

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueThe Queen is celebrating her Platinum Jubilee Last month, Finance Minister Conor Murphy ordered a review of the policy of which events can be commemorated in the Stormont estate following a row over a decision to prevent the tree planting.The DUP had called for an equality investigation and accused Mr Murphy of “intolerance and disrespect”.DUP Assembly member Joanne Bunting had originally sought permission to plant the tree on the estate as part of the Queen’s Green Canopy project, an initiative that encourages people across the UK to “Plant a Tree for the Jubilee”.Mr Murphy, whose department has responsibility for the grounds of the Stormont estate, insisted that official policy dictated that only “international events” could be commemorated with physical structures or planting.He then decided to review that policy.Last year, Sinn Fein vetoed a proposal put to the Assembly Commission to place a commemorative stone in Stormont’s Parliament Buildings to mark Northern Ireland’s centenary.Sinn Fein insisted the stone had been “designed and commissioned by representatives of one tradition” and accused unionists of failing to consult with other parties about their plan.Last year, Mr Murphy also turned down a DUP request to plant a commemorative rose bush to mark Northern Ireland’s centenary within the Stormont estate.Most ReadMystery over £bn school fund that ‘no one checked on for years’ aimed at helping NI pupils from socially deprived backgroundsFamous London restaurant The Ivy to open eaterie in Belfast

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueNorthern Ireland Minister of Health Robin Swann has received legal advice about relaxing Covid guidelines in NI By Joanthan McCambridge, Rebecca Black and David Young, PAFebruary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailHealth Minister Robin Swann has written to other Stormont ministers asking for their input before he makes any decisions on easing remaining Covid restrictions in Northern Ireland.Mr Swann took the step after receiving legal advice from Attorney General Brenda King which highlighted potential legal complications of him acting without the wider endorsement of an Executive.Mr Swann sought the guidance following the resignation of first minister Paul Givan last week, which also removed deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill from the joint office.While the remaining ministers are still in post, they are unable introduce any new business, and can only progress work already in the system.The Covid- regulations are not due to expire until March , but were previously reviewed by the Executive every three weeks.Executive approval is ordinarily required for decisions that are signicant, controversial or cross cutting.A letter sent by Mr Swann to other ministers, seen by the PA news agency, said he would now assess whether his proposals to replace restrictions with guidance cross those three thresholds.Daily

case that I have the power to amend some, but not all of the restrictions without reference to the ExecutiveRobin SwannHis letter stated: “As part of my own consideration, I want to seek colleagues’ input as to whether any or all of these changes should, in your view, be considered to meet any of these three tests.“It may be the case that I have the power to amend some, but not all of the restrictions without reference to the Executive, because they do not, inidually meet the threshold for one or more of these criteria.“In which case, I believe it may be appropriate to consider where it may be possible to act at this stage, evenI am not able to make a decision in respect of all of the remaining restrictions.”Meanwhile, former deputy first minister Michelle O’Neill said there is a “real prospect” that Covid restrictions may have to remain in place in Northern Ireland following the legal advice received by Mr Swann.However, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has insisted that Mr Swann does have the legal authority to remove the restrictions and said it does not need to be a collective decision.Update from Health Minister Robin Swann pic hVZcCcdLav— Department of HealthFebruary , Speaking in Belfast, Ms O’Neill said: “I am aware now that the health minister has received that legal advice and he wants to give it a bit more consideration.“I hope that we will be able to find a way forward, something which gives the public some hope and some progression in terms of the Covid restrictions.“This is the direct consequence of the DUP stunt last week, them walking away whenever the rest of us are trying to deal with the pandemic.“This is the outworking of what the DUP have done.”Asked about the prospect that the remaining Covid restrictions may remain in place, she said: “We have to see the legal advice, but of course that is a real prospect, this is the outworking of the DUP’s antics.”\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland afbe .ece

We have to follow the example of St Patrick and bring the light to recallsothers.ldquoWe have to start again, bringing the light of Christ into our hearts, our families and into our homes. We all know these are days of darkness, we have been living through them, days of fear and anxiety. We need the joy of the gospel, the joy of Christ, joy brought to Ireland by St Patrick.Fr Alexander continued: ldquoEach of us has to ask ourselves, what am I going to do to bring the light of faith to others  Generations of our ancestors kept the faith alive. What are you going to do to keep the faith alive  Let us revive our faith and go forward with St Patrick.Archbishop Jude Thaddeus told the congregation that St Patrick was not sent by to Ireland ldquoby God by chance.ldquoHis mission in Ireland was a deliberate intention of God, he continued. ldquoWe can read this in St Patrickrsquos writings and from the example he left behind. When St Patrick wanted to come back to Ireland, there was a lot of opposition. In his time, there were many missionaries, including bishops and priests. We have hardly heard of many of these, but we all know about St Patrick. This is very striking. Why is it so ldquoSt Patrick did not speak much, he didnrsquot write much. Today there are too many words ndash words, words, words ndash written words, spoken words, words on the internet, words on the microphone, words on the streets and the market places. There are too many words, just one word is important ndash the Word of God. If we could just listen to even a single Word of God.Referring to the Gospel readings for the feast of Candlemas, the Papal Nuncio added: ldquoOur Lady did not say anything at the Presentation of Our Lord, she kept everything in her heart. In the entire Gospel. St Joseph speaks only two words. Sometimes we speak too many words and we lose orientation and get confused. Only one word is important ndash the Word of God ndash we should listen to the Word of God. St Patrick listened to the Word of God.Speaking afterwards of his visit, Archbishop Okolo said: ldquoIt was indeed nice and uplting, praying together on that holy ground, on which St Patrick trod.Next week, the All Ireland Novena journeys to Slane where St Patrick lit the Paschal fire.The Novena can be watched online at pm via the parish webcam..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9Feburary2020_Panto.jpg","title":"Children on stage for The Wizard of Oz show  ","story":"THE abundance of musical and dramatic talent at the Patrician Youth Centre in Downpatrick is back on show for the first time in almost two years.A young and enthusiastic cast presented the pantomime, The Wizard of Oz, last week.Performing Arts and live productions at the Patrician paused in March  with the onset of Covid- and ensuing pandemic.Determined to get going again, staff and members worked on Tom Whalleyrsquos new pantomime production of the very popular musical The Wizard of Oz.Despite many ongoing Covid disruptions were delighted to have a performance which was live streamed last week.Unfortunately, in the lead-up to the event some of the principal cast members were Covid isolating.On the day before the performance leading lady Shona Gardiner, who was to play Dorothy, tested positive.In true showbiz tradition, the show had to go on and a telephone call from a former Patrician member saved the day.Mairead OrsquoHare, who played Dorothy in the Patricianrsquos  production of the Wizard of Oz, volunteered to stand in to read the role and sing the ever-popular songs.

I donrsquot see any of the issues that have been highlighted as costing a signicant amount. If they can be implemented, they would make a tangible dference to harbour users. I hope that progress can be made soon for the good of all harbour users.Thanking Cllr Devlin for her work to improve safety for sea swimmers at the harbour, South Down MLA Colin McGrath said he looked forward to ldquomuch-needed changes in Newcastle.He also believes that the series of measures outlined for the harbour could be used as a template by the local authority for open water swimming and cold water therapy across the district.Mr McGrath added: ldquoWe are fortunate to be surrounded by such beautul coastline which has many locations for accessing the water, but itrsquos vital that we make the activity as safe as possible in a select number of locations that ensure an equitable offering across the council area..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_CD.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  February 12th%2C 1992  ","story":"ARDGLASS ndash The fishing fleet in Ardglass is facing a potential crisis following a slump in the crucially-important prawn market.Demand for prawns has ped dramatically because of the recession, resulting in depressed prices and trawler men struggling to meet running costs.Yesterday, fishermenrsquos leader Dick James said: ldquoWe are not yet in a crisis, but one is fast developing.Mr James, who is chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fish Producersrsquo Organisation, has called on the Government to introduce a decommissioning scheme which would enable trawler owners to leave the industry.ldquoA decommissioning scheme would go a long way towards solving the problem. At present, we have too many boasts chasing too few fish, he remarked.Ironically, the situation has been partly caused by the fishermen catching too many prawns.Last monthrsquos good weather resulted in better-then-expected landing which further depressed the already-weakened market ndash prawn are currently selling at less than pound a stone, compared to pound a stone a year ago.However, the general recession in the economy has been the main stumbling block. As demand continues to drop, processors are keeping stocks in cold storage and are not in a position to buy additional supplies at the quayside.ldquoWe had good prices until last April. Then the market slumped and prices drop. Unfortunately, fishermanrsquos costs havenrsquot come down accordingly, Mr James said.Mr James said depression in other sectors of the industry has heightened the problem.He also believes the decommission scheme has the support of most trawler owners in Ardglass.ldquoWe are talking about the survival of the fleet as a whole. Decommissioning would help owners who are otherwise unable to get out of the industry.ldquoAnd because most of the boats are undermanned, it would to not lead to large scale redundancies among crewmen, he added.CROSSGAR ndash A Crossgar man who is renowned for his excellent time-keeping was honoured last week.Mr James McCormick, who has been winding the clock on the old Kilmore Parish Church Hall for over  years, has decided to hang up his key and retire from his conscientious job.James took over the job when the clock was repaired in  and has continued his labour of love ever since.Now the hall has been sold to the Ulster Wildle Trust for its new headquarters building, James has decided tocall it a day and has retired from his winding duties.In recognition of his timeless work over the years the development officer of the Wildle Trust, Mr Niall Timmins, presented Mr McCormick with a window box of herbs to remind him of his former winding le.STRANGFORD ndash The creation of a single committee to oversee the management of Strangford Lough has been widely welcomed.The Ulster Unionist MP for Strangford, Mr John Taylor, said the announcement represents a ldquomajor U-turn by the Government, while the Strangford Lough Nature Conservation Association described it as a ldquoserious attempt to ensure the future of the lough.The new committee is to be launched in the spring and will have a membership of around  drawn from special interest groups, such as agriculture, fishing, conservation and recreation.Member will also be appointed from nominations put forward by Down District and Ards Borough Councils, the National Trust and the Council for Nature Conservation and the Countryside.The announcement marks something of a turn-around by the Environment Minister, Mr Richard Needham, who less than six months ago proposed a two-tier management structure for the lough.The proposal was widely criticised by groups who argued that such a structure would be unwieldy and would prevent local people from having a proper influence over decision making.By scrapping that approach, Mr Needham appears to have bowed to local pressure. The Minister says the new initiative has been produced ldquofollowing extensive consultation with organisations and iniduals concerned with the future of Strangford Lough.SAINTFIELD ndash Work is to start next week leading to the provision of new traffic lights in Saintfield.The townrsquos Ulster Unionist councillor, Mr William Biggerstaff, said yesterday that preliminary work will begin on Monday for the provision of the lights at the main crossroads in the town.ldquoI welcome this commitment.

Fortunately for The Blues they had an able replacement in Christopher Magee.This early unsettlement, along with the travelling support, spurred the away side on and soon the league leaders were showing why they are just that.Gareth Keenan was denied a golden opportunity courtesy of a point blank save from Turley as Comber continued to apply pressure in the early stages. Kilmore responded well to this and remained calm on the ball.Following some quick passing from Matthew Stewart to team-mate Anton McGrattan, the Kilmore number ten played in strike partner Joe McKinney, who was adjudged to have been fouled in the danger area and won a penalty kick.Kilmorersquos McGrattan stepped up but his effort was fantastically saved by the outstretching Andrew Topping, who pushed the ball around the post and out for a corner to the frustration of the home fans.The resultant corner was headed over the Comber crossbar by Kilmore defender Jack Larkin as the away side relished in escaping potential punishment.The visitors went back in search of the opening goals immediately after, with Keenan again seeing his efforts thwarted by the Kilmore custodian.The game quickly developed into an end to end contest with chances coming thick and fast at both ends.Kilmorersquos McKinney saw his headed effort go wide with the goal seemingly gaping before his left footed effort blazed over the bar after he was neatly played through by McGrattan.Comberrsquos Brandon Nelson delivered an inviting corner to the head of team-mate Stuart Moore, although he failed to make the most of his chance.Despite the weather, things began heating up on the pitch with numerous crunching tackles on display.Kilmore captain, Niall McCarthy, escaped with just a warning following his high challenge on Comber winger Nelson although the visiting sidersquos Moore wasnrsquot as lucky after he was awarded a yellow for clattering substitute Magee.A new face was on show within the Kilmore ranks in the form of midfielder Barry Walsh. The former Killyleagh YC player impressed throughout his debut and controlled the middle of the park at ious stages throughout the game.With both the tempo and tensions high, the whistle sounded a full two minutes early to signal half-time.Comber kicked off after the interval but it was the hosts who would be awarded the first big chance of the half.Following a piercing run into the opposing defence, Kilmorersquos McKinney was brought down awarding team-mate McGrattan to test lsquokeeper Topping from  yards with the resultant free-kick.However, the Comber custodian wasnrsquot required to spring into action as the ball whisked past the wrong side of the upright.The visitors seemed to be pressed further back into their half and attempted to respond quickly.Dylan Wilson smartly dispatched of the ball on a quick counter-attack to team-mate and captain, Simon Hanna, although the number eight was halted in his tracks unfairly by Magee.For this, the Kilmore defender was the latest name to enter the refereersquos books. The home side had the advantage of the wind and decided to use this repeatedly through long ranged passes in hopes of manufacturing an attack.McKinney came close on a few occasions as he engaged in multiple footraces with Comberrsquos Reece Whittle, although often the home striker would stray onto the bounds of offside.Kilmore hit a purple patch in the opening quarter of the second half, with Comberrsquos first chance of the restart coming on the hour mark.Nelson was left unmarked at the back post after a ball was lofted into his path from skipper Hanna. However, he shanked his left-footed effort and allowed his Kilmore counterparts to remain unscathed.Despite this miss, Nelsonrsquos effort served as a reminder to the opposition that Comber was very much still a threat on the counter.The Kilmore support were up in arms minutes later when they thought a Comber hand was used to prevent a McGrattan strike from hitting its target, although these appeals were quickly shut down.Comber substitute, Ciaran Gillan, picked up a yellow card in his attempts to clear the ball from his half ndash much to the disagreement of his sidersquos management team.The visitors would be soon ruing more than a yellow card as the resultant free-kick proved costly on the  minute mark.A delicately placed McGrattan delivery floated into the path of captain McCarthy for the Kilmore skipper to head with conviction past Topping and finally open the scoring.Anton McGrattan picked up a rather needless yellow soon after for thumping the ball away amongst the celebrations as the atmosphere inside the park reached fever pitch.Comber defender Bradley Porter received a yellow card minutes later for his tackle on McKinney before the Kilmore striker suffered the same fate after he ended up on the ground in what the referee deemed as simulation.The trend of yellow cards continued with Comber captain Hanna, who landed his name in the book for exchanging some ill-advised words with the official ten minutes from full-time.As expected, the final minutes of the contest were a nervous affair for the home side, who werenrsquot committing as many bodies forward in hopes of securing a shutout.Naturally, this invited pressure from Comber, who desperately sought to spoil the Kilmore party.lsquoKeeper Turley kept his concentration for the full duration of the match and thwarted the last two efforts from Comber, with Wilson coming close before his team-mate Tumilson was denied dramatically in injury time.This signied the last piece of action as the referee brought his whistle to his lips to the relief of the Kilmore support.Following the conclusion goal scorer and man of the match, Niall McCarthy, gave his thoughts on his sidersquos impressive victory.ldquoIt was a battle, the pitch was very heavy and I think it just came down to who wanted it more, he said.ldquoWe knew with Comber coming down here that they are a very physical, very fit team, who are well-drilled.ldquoHowever, we firmly believe in our camp that we are the best team in the league.

However, by pm the taped route was ready, the registration was complete and the nervous but excited youngsters were warming up in anticipation.Primary Four and under lined up, first the boys and then the girls. With vests down to their knees and a few anxious glances to parents, it seemed that they were almost too young for such a task but once the whistle blew they set off like rockets round the m circuit.Harry McVeigh, for Newcastle AC, was the clear winner in the boysrsquo race and Aoe Maguireheld a five second lead to win the girlsrsquo race.Primary Five saw the girls and boys combined in the one race and the winners were John McElroyand Emily Kerr . The  metres didnrsquot seem a bother to either of these young athletes.Ryan Thorntonwent off hard for the P win and Saorlaith McAleenanwas the epitome of focus as she headed to the line to come first in the P girls.With  entrants and the distance now one kilometre, it was a challenging race.The P looked an experienced bunch as they gathered at the start.Many have been racing each other in the Flahavanrsquos XC Series for schools so there were scores to be settled. Maisie McVeighwas taking no chances and after a short tussle, she shrugged off the rest of the field and ran solo to take the P girlsrsquo victory.Fiachna McAleenanalso showed his mettle leading home the P boys. This was raced over m.It was great to see the support for the younger ones, not just from parents but from older siblings and club mates, who ran along side each race yelling at the younger ones to encourage them to work hard right to the finish line.On more than one occasion there were groups breaching the line as an inseparable unit and joint times had to be awarded. This was exciting for spectators and a learning experience for the runners.In time they will develop the ability to pace over the course to keep their position but leave a little in the tank for a sprint finishrequired.The series is about participation as well as competition and all runners get a point for their club provided they finish the race.This helps to engender club spirit and creates a charged atmosphere.The post primary runners were well warmed up from their cheerleading efforts on the sideline so they were primed for racing when it was eventually their turn.In Years Eight, Nine and Ten, the girls outnumbered the boys in each category but by Year  plus, it was the reverse.Still, it was good to see healthy numbers out to take part overall in the post primary end of things. The distance for year eight was m and Erin Easton , who won the girlsrsquo race by eight seconds, looked controlled throughout. Aaron OrsquoBoylehad an exciting sprint to the line to snatch glory in Year Eight boys.Emma Stewartcovered the m Year Nine girlsrsquo race at great speed to place first girl and Alex Robinson seemed to revel in the extra running as the gap between him and the second runner stretched out as the race proceeded.Year Ten boys and girls ran together as there were  when combined.The m race allowed spectators to get multiple glimpses as the they looped round the field.Aaron Lennonwon his race comfortably and Edana Butterfieldhad a similar outcome in the girlsrsquo category.The finale was Year  and up. This had a mix of gender as well as year groups. The athletes seemed to have doubled in height compared to the first race of the day and they looked powerful and committed as they loped past with long strides.The two kilometre race was a display of pacing and control with the speed picking up in the last lap.Ollie Robinsonmade sure he held his lead to the line and Amy McCartanran strongly to come first in the girlsrsquo section.Racing completed there was a flurry to clear up before the next shower and many hands made light work.Thanks are due to all the volunteers ndash both those who are involved on the day and those who do the admin behind the scenes. The commitment of the young runnersis highly commendable and the continued backing of McGrady Financial Services is much appreciated.These young folk are the future of our clubs and the sport in general and all those who are facilitating this, know that it is time well spent.The next race is in Tollymore Forest Park on March .

Finnerty eventually notched the next score for his Galway outfit, before the goal scorer, Conroy, would kick over from distance ndash albeit with some wind assistance.The hosts seemed to fighting an uphill battle as the wind battered around Pairc Esler in favour of the visiting side, with Conroy once again managing to point from long range.This opened up a five point winning margin with the Mourne men desperately needing scores on the board.However, the weather could not be at fault for all of their shortcomings as they struggled with the impressive Galway forward line.Walsh was once again involved when he surged past the Down defence before setting up team-mate Owen Gallagher for an easy score.Cormac McCartan attempted to get the home side back into the contest with what seemed like an easy kick over from  metres, although the wind made sure the ball hung in the air before ping comfortably into the hands of Galway lsquokeeper Conor Flaherty.Downrsquos Andrew Gilmore did convert his point three minutes later but as per the theme of the match, Galway replied quickly through Tomo Culhane, who took the mark and scored at the other end.Galway introduced the ing Damien Comer to the fray and with his first touch of the ball he also took the mark and made no mistake with his chance to secure another point for the visitors.Walsh was relishing the blustery conditions and was firing from will at all angles, with one such effort sailing over the black spot from around  metres before the half-time whistle.This signied the last score of a half that contained very few positives for McCartanrsquos side.Half-time: Down - Galway -.The Mourne men registered the opening score of the second half, courtesy of a Barry OrsquoHagan free.Two minutes later, home supporters were perhaps left a little surprised when a goal opportunity presented itself but Cormac McCartan opted instead to play it safe and fire over the bar.Nevertheless, Down had scored two points answered and soon OrsquoHagan would ensure a third after he took the mark and converted the chance.OrsquoHagan continued his impressive start to the second half when he kicked over once again following a turnover in possession.It was now Galway who was struggling with the wind, with Kieran Molloy witnessing his straightforward point from  metres halted by the breeze.Passionate ranting from Down manager, James McCartan, saw him pick up a yellow after exchanging words with the fourth official but there was no denying his side at their tails up.A wide mark from Galwayrsquos Paul Kelly encouraged the hosts further but Gallagher eventually notched his sidersquos first point after the interval following twenty minutes of action.Despite all of Downrsquos hard work, the scoreboard still favoured the visitors by five points in what was a sobering reminder of the home outfitrsquos poor first half display.It didnrsquot help the hosts when Comer notched the next score before Walsh followed suit with a trio of converted frees.Galway attempted to inflict further damage at the death as Tony Gill barrelled down on goal, although he was dragged down before he could unleash his shot.Continuing his impressive kicking form from frees, Walsh once again converted to complete his sidersquos scoring.However, it would be Downrsquos Gilmore who would register the final score of the contest with the last kick of the game, as he curled his left-footed effort over the bar in added time.Following the final whistle, Down manager James McCartan reflected on his sidersquos performance.ldquoWe are disappointed, the game was closer than the six point margin but we lost it in the first half, he said.ldquoWe let Galway play and we werenrsquot putting bodies on the line. I challenged the guys at half-time and there was a big improvement in the first twenty minutes of the second half.ldquoGalway hit us on the break and they went and got a couple of late scores to put a bit of gloss on it.

As we emerge from the pandemic, more people will choose to visit the resort where there are exciting plans in place to provide even more for things for people to do and see.ldquoNewcastle and many parts of the wider district boast some of the most spectacular scenery anywhere in the world and the one thing that people can be assured of when they visit is a warm Irish welcome. ldquoCllr Clarke said that over recent years, investment to overhaul the promenade and the Main Street through the heart of the resort has paid a handsome idend.ldquoWhile the resort enjoys many international visitors, Newcastle is also a top destination for day-trippers which provides the townrsquos economy with a signicant boost and helps safeguard many jobs, he said.ldquoWe have the Mournes, the sea, forest parks, golf courses and nearby Murlough which all add to the great package Newcastle has to offer.ldquoThe calibre of cafes, bars and restaurants are top notch and it is no surprise that the resort is noted for the high level of its hospitality services. These all add to the experience that the town provides.Cllr Clarke said while Covid had a major impact on the tourism industry, with spring and summer on the horizon, Newcastle will be ready to offer the warm welcome to visitors that the resort is noted for.In addition, he said the fact that Newcastle is regarded as one of the top friendliest visitor destinations is testament to the efforts of so many people, from tourism providers to local businesses and residents to a raft of statutory organisations, including Newry, Mourne and Down Council.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoIt is tremendous that the collective efforts and ard work of so many people has been rewarded with the people who come to Newcastle voting it one of the most friendliest places they have visited..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9February2020_Owl.jpg","title":"Rare barn owls return to  nest at Finnebrogue estate  ","story":"RARE and vulnerable barn owls have ed to nest at the Finnebrogue estate, near Downpatrick.There are believed to be fewer than  breeding pairs of barn owls in Northern Ireland, but their population has been given a much-needed boost with the discovery of a new nest site.The Finnebrogue estate is nestled along the banks of the Quoile river with an expanse of  acres of mixed farm land with half given over to the environment.In January last year, bird boxes were placed around the farm in the hope of attracting breeding barn owls over the winter.Following the use of thermal imaging in April, a pair were discovered nesting in one of the boxes.Commenting on the exciting find, Mark Sandford, Finnebrogue farm manager, said: ldquoHaving only placed nesting boxes up in , it took no time for a barn owl pair to settle. This is testament to our land management, meaning there is ample food resources available for them.He continued: ldquoBarn owl diet consists of mainly wood mice, pygmy shrews and young rats, which in turn are attracted to the estatersquos mature woodland and areas of grass scrubland which regularly throw out grain to encourage a good population of rodents.ldquoWe hope that these barn owls will keep coming back year after year and continue to add vital numbers to our small and vulnerable Northern Irish population.Mark is receiving support from Ulster Wildle through their barn owl conservation work.Katy Bell, Senior Conservation Officer, explains why this pair is so important.ldquo has been a dficult year for our already struggling barn owl population. The wet and extremely hot weather meant that most of our barn owl nest sites failed, so we were thrilled to hear this news.ldquoLuckily, this pair couldnrsquot have chosen a more sympathetic farm to set up home with wild bird cover, meadows and mature hedgerows providing plentul foraging habitat and food for barn owls to thrive.She continued: ldquoWith fewer than  breeding pairs of barn owls estimated to be left in Northern Ireland, farmers and landowners play a key role in securing their future.ldquoBy working together, we can help protect precious nest sites, monitor these beautul birds and provide help and advice on owl-friendly farming.The chicks were kindly ringed by David Galbraith, a licenced volunteer ringer from the British Trust for Ornithology .This will generate important information on the birdsrsquo survival, productivity and movement - and is non-invasive as the birds remain sleepy during the process.Barn owls are legally protected and can be sensitive to disturbance, soyou find a nest site, please leave it alone and get in touch with Ulster Wildle.Tell-tale signs to look for include distinctive whitewash pings, feathers and regurgitated pellets of bones and fur.

In the opening  minutes a number of early misdemeanours from the travelling team in the tackle, at the breakdown and at scrum led to Friends dominating territory and possession as the game got up and running.Within this period the home team gathered up an eight-point lead through a well struck penalty following a Down High tackle and a quick tapped free kick on the Down five metre line after the front row had been judged to have pushed early in a scrum, which led to a try for the hosts. As the game moved into its middle stages, Down began to find their way back into the game with some eye catching counter attacks from their back three.Meanwhile half backs, George Thompson at scrum half and Ben Cassidy at out half, kicked well at key moments in spite of the wind, to capitalise on space left by Friends in their back field.Just before half time it was following one of these kicks that Down earned a penalty on the Friends ten metre line.Cassidy kicked to the corner and off the resulting line out Down mauled close to Friends line before Ryan Halpin saw an opportunity to barge over the whitewash for a well worked try.Cassidy then reduced arrears to one point with an accurate conversion.Down entered the second half confident with the strong wind now very much in their favour.Things didnrsquot always go their way with some periods when the green defence was severely tested.However, around ten minutes into the half Halpin found himself back on the scoresheet to give Down High the lead for the first time as he strode clear of the covering defence off a well-timed pass from rumbling front row forward, Mark Jackson. Cassidy added the two points to give Down a six-point margin in their favour.With ten minutes to go, Halpin played a key role Downrsquos crucial third try. Captain, Brett Kelly who had an excellent day both in attack and defence, laid the foundations for this score executing a pre-planned set piece play.Following this, George Thompson spotted an overlap on the blindside with Halpin ending up on the ball in a two versus one scenario with full back Alex Watson outside him space.The pass was timed superbly and Watson ed over in the corner for an unconverted try to take the score to -.To their credit, the home side didnrsquot accept that Downrsquos  point lead was a done deal and for the closing ten minutes, applied plenty of pressure.Indeed Friends crossed the line with one minute remaining on the clock for an unconverted try leaving a nervy finish for Down High as they sought to protect their six point lead.The restart offered some territorial respite and all in the travelling squad and those supporting them leapt high with joy when a Friends knock-on gave the referee the cue to blow the final whistle with time well past the  minute mark.Down High now face Sullivan Upper at home in the semi-finals on Saturday, February . In other games at home last week, Down High third XV bowed out of their plate competition at the quarter-final stage with a narrow - loss to Campbell College fourth XV in what was an entertaining fixture, while a select U-  team defeated Wellington College -.The other plaudits of the weekend went to the U- A team, who produced a captivating performance to defeat RBAI - on Saturday morning.The U- B and Cs, also playing RBAI, lost but put in some proud performances demonstrating the impressive depth in this squad..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13213668.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I thank her for her role protecting the public and making our streets safer.— Boris JohnsonFebruary , Prime Minister Boris Johnson also praised the outgoing commissioner for serving with “great dedication and distinction over many decades”.“I thank her for her role protecting the public and making our streets safer,” he tweeted.Home Secretary Priti Patel said Dame Cressida “held the role during challenging times” and “exemplied the increasingly erse nature of our police” as the first woman to hold the post.“She would be the first to say that she has held the role during challenging times yet for nearly five years she has undertaken her duties with a steadfast dedication to protecting our capital city and its people, including during the unprecedented period of the pandemic,” Ms Patel said.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey also thanked her, but added “a change of leadership in the Met is long overdue”.He also demanded that Mr Johnson “publicly recuse” himself over the appointment of her successor due to the ongoing Met investigation into parties held in No  during Covid restrictions..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Critics delighted and supporters saddened as Dame Cressida Dick resigns article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

We have heard numerous plans and proposals to develop this site come forward over the years, but the inability to reach an agreement has cost the public a key facility the North millions in potential funding.“While serving as Deputy First Minister Mark Durkan helped negotiate the ownership of key military sites from the Ministry of Defence to the Executive so that they could be used to benefit people here. Sites like Crumlin Road Gaol have been redeveloped and become a jewel in our tourism crown, but still the Maze lies empty, despite the SDLP’s vision. Like too many key projects, the Maze prison site is yet another casualty of the dys that has permeated The Executive Office for the  years it has been led by Sinn Féin and the DUP. They have been more interested in using the Maze site to score political points against each other than to see it’s full potential realised for the benefit of local people. The huge opportunities this site presents have been stled as a direct result of their own self-interest and lack of vision to make real change.”Lagan Valley MLA Pat Catney said: “For as long as I have been a public representative I have been urging action to make this site a hub for everyone in Lagan Valley and beyond. There is a real opportunity for this to become a flagship project that could both create new jobs and attract visitors to this area.“We are currently spending a fortune on the upkeep of this site and getting nowhere. We need to see a real sea change in the approach to the Maze siteit is ever going to realise its full potential and I hope the upcoming election s local MLAs and Ministers who are determined to deliver it for the people in this area.”: MLA calls for ‘creative thinking’ to revitalise townsSDLP  \"       \"   for the newsletterKeep up with the latest news and views from NorthernIrelandWorldSign Up       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    ]]Most PopularLisburn police issue scam warning...NewsWoman cautioned after boy injured in Lurgan crash...NewsPortadown mum making own wine, knitting her wedding dress an...NewsLarne man given Probation for assault...News arrested following UDA criminality-linked probe search in Carrickfergus\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime man--arrested-following-uda-criminality-linked-probe-search-in-carrickfergus- itm_sourceparsely-api\" arrested following UDA criminality-linked probe search in Carrickfergus\" \"\" width\"\" arrested following UDA criminality-linked probe search in Carrickfergus\" data-s-el\"\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-index\"\" href\"https:www.northernirelandworld news crime man--arrested-following-uda-criminality-linked-probe-search-in-carrickfergus- itm_sourceparsely-api\"Manarrested following UDA criminality-linked probe sea...NewsMost PopularBest pizza ovens  UK: the best pizza oven for home use -...RecommendedValentine’s Day meals: the best supermarket meal deals UK ...Recommended Home office desks UK: make smart use of the space you have w...RecommendedAldi’s popular hanging egg chair is about to be back in stoc...RecommendedBest dog beds : stylish, comfortable dog beds for all ki...Recommended                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us           \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.
