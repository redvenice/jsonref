The people who didn’t bother turning up to work, you know, they will be the first people that we have to get rid of, unfortunately.”The same messages were then repeated in Hindi for the benefit of workers who did not speak English. Bakkavor has since apologised and said that Madden is now on “leave”.Some workers have told the  and ITV News that they have felt under pressure to attend work at the Elveden site.A Bakkavor spokesman said: “We take this very seriously and are investigating the matter. We apologise to our Elveden staff for any miscommunication or worry caused. The manager in question has been given leave and prior to his return to work, he will undertake further training around his role and responsibilities and the high standards we expect of a Bakkavor manager.“Our advice to all our staff is to stay at home if they are feeling unwell or believe they have symptoms or if they are self-isolating due to members of their household displaying symptoms – points that were communicated at the staff briefing you have footage from.“We are saddened and concerned to hear today that a few colleagues feel under pressure to come to work and we’re putting protocols in place to speak to all staff at their next shift to make it absolutely clear that no colleague should come to work if they feel unwell, are self-isolating or if a family member is unwell.” Andre Marques, a London organiser at the GMB union, which has members on the Elveden site, said: “This behaviour is absolutely shocking. It is beyond unacceptable to threaten workers with the sack just for trying to keep themselves and their families safe.Bakkavor said that multi-tubes were just one measure in a range of “further controls” to make its sites safer, including the introduction of visors. It said it previously had in place “wide-ranging safety measures” and had not made, or had plans to make, any redundancies."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27e4e319c760147399c22752190e20e8ab92e70f/0_265_4912_2947/master/4912.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3abe0507e0fed6116bbcb76ba68c3707","title":"opec russia reduce oil production prop up prices","story":"There were also concerns that Mexico could derail the deal after refusing to sign up to its share of cuts following a marathon overnight meeting of the world’s major oil producers.But Mexico cast doubt over Opec’s plans, afterapparently refusing to sign up to its share of cuts, which would have been 400,000 barrels per day (bpd). The country instead offered to cut 100,000 bpd.Riyadh and Moscow were expected to press Mexico to sign the accord during a video conference between G20 energy ministers on Friday.Even if Opec+ succeeded in reducing output by 15m bpd, it may not be enough to prop up prices while demand continues to drop during the coronavirus lockdown. Despite the oil cartel’s best efforts, global storage facilities could still quickly fill up.Analysts from Goldman Sachs are forecasting that the coronavirus crisis will slash demand by 19m bpd in April and May. “Such cuts, if agreed upon tomorrow, would still be too little and too late to prevent a decline in prices in coming weeks as storage capacity becomes saturated.”But Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp, an online currency trading platform, said that while the deal will only partially offset the decline in oil prices “that’s what it was supposed to do.”“The storm clouds for oil prices will only completely dissipate when lockdowns are lifted,” he added.The US president, Donald Trump, who has said US output was already falling due to low prices, has also warned Riyadh it could face tariffs on its oil if it did not cut enough to help the US oil industry, whose higher costs have left it struggling with low prices.Both Opec and Russian officials have said the scale of the crisis required involvement of all producers. “We are expecting other producers outside the Opec+ club to join the measures, which might happen … during G20,” Kirill Dmitriev, head of Russia’s wealth fund and one of Moscow’s top oil negotiators, told Reuters.The US, whose output has surged to surpass Saudi and Russian production since it began large-scale fracking, was invited to Thursday’s Opec+ talks, but it was not clear whether it had joined the video conference.

The future is uncertain, but it seems likely that over the next 18 months the UK will experience a cycle of national lockdowns while it awaits a vaccine. This is far from ideal. Repeated lockdowns could lead to mass unemployment, rising national debt, uncontrolled bankruptcies and widespread social unrest as people grow sick of draconian measures. Many people are now asking how quickly the lockdown can be lifted – and how soon we can return to normal.Monitoring the reproductive rate of infection figure, R0, will be crucial to any decision about lifting the lockdown. The figure indicates how contagious an infection is. As the R0 number drops below one, each existing infection causes less than one new infection eventually, the outbreak will decline and die out. When R0 remains steadily less than one, governments may decide to gradually loosen restrictions, with the lockdown relaxed earlier in lower intensity areas and later in hotspot cities such as London.New data published this week in the Lancet, from a team of researchers at the University of Hong Kong led by the clinician Gabriel Leung, shows that the spread of infection in China outside Wuhan, measured by the R0 in four major cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Wenzhou) fell below one within two weeks of partial lockdown. This is good news it shows a partial lockdown can quite quickly suppress transmission of the virus. Our national lockdown and social distancing measures may already have brought the R0 down across much of the country.Moreover there’s a crucial difference between the response to coronavirus in China and that in the UK. From the beginning of the outbreak, the Lancet researchers note, “only residents were allowed to enter residential communities, face mask-wearing was made compulsory, and non-essential community services were shut down”. Health authorities also found cases, traced contacts and isolated them, monitoring their quarantine closely.So it was not just a lockdown and social distancing that were responsible for bringing down the R0 number in China, but the country’s community surveillance approach. Scarred by memories of the Sars outbreak in 2002, China and other east Asian states acted with greater speed, imposing total or partial lockdowns supported by a protective shield of community measures – finding people with the virus, isolating them swiftly, and tracing those they contacted.In South Korea, this took the form of mass testing and digital contact tracing in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Vietnam, health authorities identified cases based on people’s symptoms, and used testing when available. Strict isolation of cases and contacts was monitored by phone apps and home visits. Rather than enforcing a one-size-fits-all approach, China varied the lockdown across different regions. While Wuhan was under total lockdown, other provinces had more autonomy, and focused on quarantining the household clusters where most transmission took place.Despite Britain’s slow start, there are reasons for hope. Behind the scenes, general practices and public health workers are working at tremendous speed to build our own protective shield. They’re finding places to treat infected patients who aren’t sick enough for hospital but can’t be nursed at home, visiting those with long-term conditions or coronavirus symptoms, and building a picture of community spread using 111 data. The UK should also be able to roll out contact tracing using the new NHSX app and the popular Zoe Covid symptom tracker.We have four to six weeks to ramp up testing and build our community shield before we lift the lockdown. After this, we can then get most people back to work, focus on quarantining inidual cases and contacts, and suppress outbreaks if they arise. Hopefully this approach will help us avoid further national lockdowns. But it will take a long time before life returns to normal.• Anthony Costello is professor of global health and sustainable development at University College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/38fda813e25e25d19b49fbfe2503307f3e96ce96/0_145_4352_2614/master/4352.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cf36a82e999d698ac44c4652ca1b18c","title":"sunbathing park deep moral questions philosophers coronavirus individual","story":"Coronavirus gives fresh urgency to philosophers’ struggle with the conflict between inidual choice and the common goodSunbathing in the park, normally the most innocent of pleasures, is causing outrage. The police are involved the parks may be shut.Lockdown is never easy, but when the weather is good, the urge to be outside, to feel the sun on your face, to lie on the grass, under a tree, is almost irresistible. To close your eyes and pretend just for a little while that life is normal. How can this be wrong?Extreme libertarians think it is not. They say that freedom is so important that losing it is worse than death (other people’s deaths, at any rate). Most of us don’t agree. We accept the need for social distancing. But even so, the lockdown rules don’t require us to stay in all the time. There are exceptions. Why not just one more, just for me, my family, our suntan cream and picnic basket? If my local park is empty, my family and I can enjoy our picnic  in the open air. We refresh ourselves and don’t harm anyone else – they chose to stay at home anyway. What could possibly be wrong with that?Moral and political philosophers have long struggled with the conflict between inidual choice and the common good, between general rules and exceptions, and have come to very different conclusions about the right answer.It is plainly rational, game theorists say, to make some people better off (me and my family) and no one worse off (everyone else). Some moral philosophers have thought it morally right too. According to utilitarians, rules are made to be broken, when you make people happier by breaking them. Our fundamental moral duty, John Stuart Mill said, is to produce the greatest happiness of the greatest number. In the time of coronavirus, that means staying away from other people.But if you can do that while making yourself happier – by sunbathing or picnicking, because everyone else has obeyed the lockdown – it is not just permitted but actually morally right to go for it. Of course, seeing my family reclining outdoors may send onlookers into a righteous fury, reducing the total happiness (though righteous fury can be pretty enjoyable too). Also we may inspire others to break the rules themselves, and if everyone thinks this way, the park will be full. That is dangerous for us all and it would be better to stay at home. But all this means is that I ought to be discreet. If I am, no harm, no wrong.Can that really be true? Immanuel Kant thought the fundamental moral question was a different one: what if everyone did that? Kant thought it was right to act only in ways that could be a universal law. We know that if everyone picnicked in the park, no one could do so safely. When I do it anyway, I am acting in a way that could not be for everyone. I am relying on everyone else abiding by the rules, exploiting their conformity to benefit myself. I am treating myself as an exception, a special case. This is not a way of treating other people with respect. This is not fair.If we accept that morality is not only a matter of harm and benefit, but also respect and fairness, we can see what is wrong with picnicking in the park at the present time. But once we start to think in these terms, we need to look at a much broader picture. As political philosophers such as Karl Marx emphasise, our inidual decisions are made against a social background that we have not chosen. Lockdown is a very different experience for different people, depending on their personality, their family circumstances and their living conditions. It is easier to stay at home in a large, roomy house with a pleasant garden than in a cramped high-rise flat with no outdoor space.Lockdown reinforces existing social inequalities. It is even less excusable for the more fortunate to break the rules. Though we should all keep to the guidelines, it doesn’t follow that we should heap blame on those who don’t, not knowing what staying at home is like for them, not knowing their reasons for being out. Of course they should comply, but be kind most people are doing their best.It is a mark of the crisis we are in that simply sunbathing in the park raises the deepest questions about what truly matters in our lives: the happiness of all, even if I rely on others obeying the rules, as utilitarians would say. Or respect and fairness, as Kant would reply. The role of inidual responsibility within a social context, as Marx would insist.Finally, we can draw on another value very important to Marx (and Rousseau and Hegel too): the value of solidarity. There are huge disparities between the burdens a few are being asked to bear for the sake of the many. Doctors, nurses and other key workers constantly risk their lives to look after the sick and to keep essential services running. For the rest of us, there is very little that we can do to make a difference in this global crisis. It is easy to feel helpless and overwhelmed. But in fact, sitting at home, we can stand in solidarity with those who are doing more. We are doing our part, and treating fairly everyone else who is doing the same. It is the most, and the least, we can do.• Alison Hills is a fellow and tutor in philosophy at St John’s College, University of Oxford"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e69eb678012407250db643095ff47716c18e978/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1457f8d0810ff1fe47e91400af318c9","title":"wisconsin primary coronavirus republican voting by mail","story":"The deliberate chaos and unthinkable images from the state’s primary marked Republicans’ dress rehearsal for NovemberIf any lingering doubts remained, Tuesday should have erased them all. Republicans will weaponize anything – even in-person voting during a deadly pandemic – to maintain power, avoid accountability and bend electoral rules in their favor. Worse, the US supreme court will have their back.Make no mistake: the deliberate chaos and unthinkable images from Wisconsin on Tuesday – Americans on line for hours, wearing homemade masks, risking a gruesome respiratory disease to exercise their right to vote – wasn’t just a warning sign for November’s elections. It was Republicans’ dress rehearsal.It’s scarcely 200 days until the real show. The coronavirus has already pushed more than a dozen states to postpone primaries and forced fearful Ohio and Wisconsin governors into court the day before an election, desperate to avoid worsening a public health crisis. It’s quite likely that the virus will threaten in-person voting in many states and cities in November as well.That’s why a growing non-partisan chorus has called for expanding vote-by-mail options this fall. It can be done five states already conduct all their elections this way and every state allows some level of mail-in voting. It doesn’t favor either party – just ask Republicans in Utah and Colorado. It’s safer during a pandemic, but also secure: a study of hundreds of millions of votes in Oregon, ever since it became the first to adopt all-mail elections, found fewer than 15 fraudulent ballots cast over more than a decade.But while the quiet part sometimes comes out louder than expected, most of the Republican party’s anti-vote-by-mail excuses are ludicrous. If the president’s intention is to conjure phoney visions of voter fraud, others hope to simply slow-walk reform. When Senate Democrats attempted to add election protection safeguards to the first coronavirus stimulus package, the Republican senator John Barrasso insisted they “have no place in an emergency rescue package for the American people”. Election assistance funding, sniffed his colleague Marsha Blackburn, “has nothing to do with Covid-19”.On Tuesday, however, the connection between voting and the virus should have been clear enough for even a Republican senator to see. When Robin Vos, Wisconsin’s Republican assembly speaker, tried to deny it, he wore a mask and full personal protective gear. He looked like one of those mean government agents looking to capture ET, which only undercut his assurances that voters stacked up in the five available Milwaukee precincts had absolutely nothing to fear.Along a dreary 5-4 party line vote, the supreme court’s conservative majority, most appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote, overturned two lower-court rulings that had extended the vote-by-mail deadline until next week, despite evidence that tens of thousands of absentee ballots had yet to be delivered to voters who requested them, and that untold thousands more might not be postmarked in time. Ruling comfortably from their own living rooms, the five conservatives required these voters to leave their homes during a shelter-in-place order and placed them in the path of a virus. (On Wednesday, the day after the election, reports came of absentee ballots piled in post offices, undelivered.)That the supreme court intervened not on the side of voters and fair elections, but in order to protect particular Republican partisan interests, should be saddening, yet unsurprising. Chief Justice John Roberts arrived in Washington almost 30 years ago as a young justice department appointee with a particular interest: eroding the protections of the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Under his leadership, this court has embraced his cramped vision with gusto.The Roberts court has made clear that it should not be looked to as any guarantor of the foundational right to vote. Not in an emergency. Not at all. In 2013’s Shelby County v Holder, a 5-4 court defanged the enforcement provisions of section V of the VRA and laid the groundwork for a decade of voter ID requirements, precinct closures and voter roll purges from states with documented histories of racist voting inequities.The legislatures behind those efforts, a 5-4 court decreed in 2018’s Abbott v Texas, must be awarded the “presumption of good faith” – even for naked racial gerrymandering schemes. Those voter roll purges were upheld in 2018’s Husted v A Philip Randolph Institute, where the court, again 5-4, created a non-existent loophole that justified canceling registrations if a voter had not casted a ballot in two consecutive elections. Then last year, Roberts authored a, yes, 5-4 decision – Common Cause v Rucho – which slammed the federal courthouses closed to partisan gerrymandering claims at precisely the time a growing number of decisions, by judges appointed by presidents of both parties, saw both an urgent role for the courts and a clear standard for when politicized mapmaking crossed a constitutional boundary.Non-partisan electoral reformers, Democratic congressional leadership, and even some apostate Republicans like Bill Kristol and the former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele have been battling to ensure that November’s election doesn’t look like the one this week in Wisconsin. After all, even if Congress does nothing to create a national vote-by-mail standard, there’s still likely to be record demand for absentee ballots this fall. And just as the underfunded election administrators and US Postal Service were overwhelmed by an unprecedented 1.2m requests in Wisconsin, it’s easy to imagine a creaky system collapsing under similar strains in November.The Republican strategy is clear: drag their feet so it’s difficult to properly fund vote-by-mail. Mislead the public with fictional claims of voter fraud that get amplified on Fox News and by Russian bots on Twitter. Finally, count on John Roberts and the court’s partisan 5-4 majority to backstop any efforts to make free, fair and safe voting more difficult.If this plays out according to the Republican plan, it will plunge this nation from an unprecedented public health crisis into a dark constitutional emergency that threatens the legitimacy of the White House, the courts and American democracy itself. That’s a frightening sentence to write. But it’s long past time we call this what it is: elected Republican officials, and the conservatives who they have handed lifelong tenure on the federal bench, have now proven that they are willing to see Americans die rather than hold fair elections that might oust them from power. They have used a pandemic to suppress votes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69a0f49438b82ad283bbd92e99df528d494ada4d/262_221_3719_2231/master/3719.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=312d7b554fb4aa4a6e701a94f1957a40","title":"marcus brigstocke funniest things","story":"The comedian and actor on the things that make him laugh the mostI supported Bill Bailey on tour for a while and his shows are sublime.

Two weeks ago she got a call saying the interview was cancelled. “I feel so sad and frustrated. I’d been nervous about leaving uni and getting an interview was really exciting,” she says.Many are in similar positions. Alice Cole (not her real name) is in her final year at the University of Brighton and wanted to go into the NGO sector as a researcher. She was feeling confident about her prospects after graduation and there were jobs available, but the outlook has changed rapidly. “Because of coronavirus, funding for NGOs is getting smaller and there are fewer jobs at entry-level positions,” she says. “It won’t be possible anymore.”Students are starting to realise they will be graduating into a global recession. According to the Institute of Student Employers (ISE), many firms have scaled down their recruitment of entry-level staff and more than a quarter of businesses are reducing the number of graduates they hire this year.While some firms are moving assessments and interviews online, the majority have cancelled them. “Thousands of young people are supposed to be entering the labour market from July and they could be left without work and nothing to do while coronavirus is sorted out,” says Stephen Isherwood, chief executive of the ISE. “We need to make sure that a whole generation isn’t lost.”One graduate recruiter says they have already retracted offers. “Firms are being realistic and most are putting recruitment on hold. No one wants to offer an opportunity which might not be there in three months’ time.”James Turner, CEO of the Sutton Trust, says although we don’t know the full extent of the virus on the graduate job market yet, shrinking opportunities tend to be bad for social mobility, with students unable to access internships and other work experience placements. He says: “Internships are increasingly necessary for many graduate jobs, and there is a risk that young people with professional connections may be able to find work experience while other, openly-advertised, opportunities cease to exist.”Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, says although most companies will feel the impact, there will be some big winners and some losers depending on the sector. “Even in this crisis, some employers are booming. Technology companies, the food sector and logistics firms are busier than ever,” he says. “You might not end up with the job you hoped for but you can get a job.”Students can also rely on their university careers’ services, and Kim Connor Streich, marketing director of the Debut Careers app, thinks it is vital that applicants practice video interviews and presenting on camera.Others, however, think we will see more students deciding to take master’s degrees or further courses of study. In other times of recession, staying on at university has been a good alternative to struggling to get a job, with the hope that iniduals will emerge not only with improved skills but into a recovering jobs market. Cole thinks this is her only option. “I live in a rural area of Wales so there are very few job opportunities around here. I’m currently looking into doing a master’s,” she says. “The easiest thing to do right now is to delay entering the job market by a year so things have a chance to get back to normal.”James Catchpole, director of the legal practice course at the City Law School, thinks the end result may be a more highly skilled workforce. “We need to make sure we prepare them even better than we have done and turn them into even better candidates,” he says.Hillman agrees. “You can get government-backed loans for postgraduate study, and unis will be falling over themselves to recruit home students as international numbers will be down significantly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7ac8783f6f56a80865ae97583b425041bcf102a5/0_0_1985_1307/master/1985.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e93eebd5fae8fb32e9371372cf26d2d0 880w","title":"fashion meets fortnite rise of 3d clothes digital catwalks","story":"The pandemic is forcing the industry to get creative online and look to precedents set by gaming. But can the shift to digital help fashion create a more sustainable future?Virtual clothing and cyberspace catwalk shows may sound like the stuff of a William Gibson novel. But with physical fashion weeks on hold, and many designers unable to produce their next collections owing to the Covid-19 crisis, the niche world of digital fashion has been catapulted to the mainstream.“Anyone who wants to put on a catwalk show in June will have to go digital,” says Kerry Murphy, founder of “digital fashion house” The Fabricant, which he says has seen a spike in interest since lockdown began. One of The Fabricant’s clients, Tommy Hilfiger, is among brands already testing avatars, holograms and augmented-reality formats internally, the company’s CEO, Daniel Grieder, told fashion trade title WWD.The world’s first entirely virtual fashion week, Shanghai fashion week, took place last month. Despite some technical glitches, one designer, Angel Chen, demonstrated the possibilities of the format with a thrilling five-minute presentation featuring real models and computer generated graphics. Models were directed and styled via video link, because the designer was self-isolating.Moscow fashion week was also shown virtually earlier this week, with 830,000 people streaming its shows. The British Fashion Council also confirmed that it is to replace its London fashion week men’s showcase in June with a digital event. Helsinki fashion week, in July, will also be digital, a decision taken prior to the pandemic for environmental reasons, with all collections to be created by a 3D artist.Shows could become even more immersive and hi-tech as the discipline evolves 3D avatars wearing digitally created clothing, real models’ faces beamed on to 3D bodies and real models wearing real or digital clothing are all options. “There is no wrong answer and brands don’t need to use the catwalk format specifically – they are forced to be creative,” says Murphy.Murphy firmly believes that 3D clothing will soon become a mainstream consumer pastime, too, as technological advances allow those without 3D modelling skills and software to digitally style their own outfits. Last week, his company launched a beta platform, Leela, that aims to automate this process, enabling users to scan a picture of their face on to a 3D digital body and choose clothing for it to wear.Digital fashion “is going to be as big as retail”, insists Murphy, who argues that paying for digital clothing had already been normalised for players of Fortnite. “Everyone has a virtual identity, and that is only going to get bigger.” Digital fashion has clear sustainability benefits, enabling customers to buy “fantastical” outfits to express their identities on social media, without wearing an outfit once then consigning it to landfill, a trend that has become prevalent on social media.“There’s enough clothing in the world. This way brands can sell fewer physical items – can produce less stuff – but keep margins the same,” says Murphy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/283e74b223bf00c2b3167e4a11de7ff81687c29e/0_1345_4866_2921/master/4866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55482417c6a9bcd1006f099238b0125d","title":"sir denis follows the man who ended the ban on women playing football","story":"With the former secretary of the FA set to be inducted posthumously into the University of Nottingham’s Sport Hall of Fame we speak to his daughter about his remarkable lifeMuch has been made of the Football Association’s 50-year ban from 1921 on female players using its affiliated pitches, which scythed down the women’s game just as its growth had accelerated, with matches attracting attendances in excess of 50,000. Little, though, has been said of the eventual lifting of the ban in 1971, or of the man who authored the letter rescinding it. Now, the University of Nottingham is set to induct posthumously Sir Denis Follows – the then secretary of the FA and an alumnus – into its Sport Hall of Fame.The uncovering of the small but critical role of Follows, who died in 1983 aged 75, in the development of women’s football – which later led to him being named honorary life vice-president of the Women’s Football Association – happened by chance. Follows’s daughter, Maggie Ferris – another Nottingham alumnus – mentioned her father in a routine fundraising phone call with the university.The student that jotted down a few notes from their call took them away and soon afterwards the university and Ferris began to explore the history of a man who had a firm belief in equality and a person’s right to play sport and felt the lifting of the ban was natural. “He was always campaigning about things,” explains Ferris. “That was just part of what he was. And he was quite self-effacing, he never made a big deal of any achievement. Well, he was pretty pleased about winning the World Cup,” she adds with a chuckle.Follows was FA secretary in 1966. He introduced the idea of the first mascot for a finals – World Cup Willie – and separated the tournament’s organising committee, for which his daughter worked in the holidays, from the everyday running of the FA. He also presided over the loss of the Jules Rimet trophy, when it was stolen from a stamp exhibition, and subsequent recovery.“The Jules Rimet cup was fabulous, it was absolutely beautiful. I’ve got a photo of my mum in our back garden holding it with our dog. Anyway, he decided that the best way to get it to Mexico was in his briefcase, so he just carried his briefcase all the time. In that way he was quite practical. It worked. First it was under the bed, then in his briefcase.”When Nobby Stiles’ contact lenses went missing, it was Ferris’s sister who went to an all-night Boots to get some more and Follows, who had connections with pilots as general secretary of the British Airline Pilots’ Association (Balpa), who arranged for them to be flown out to Stiles.Follows’ journey either side of 1966 is equally remarkable. Born in 1908, he started in student politics, becoming chairman of the University Athletics Union, representing the body on the FA council and being given the job of unpaid FA treasurer before becoming president of the National Union of Students.In those various posts he travelled in the 1930s to Latvia before it was invaded by the Soviet Union and to Madrid as Spain slid towards civil war in 1936, attending student conferences. “In a lot of domestic ways he was not capable at all,” says Ferris. “He could just about do tea and toast or boil an egg but in some ways he was a real innovator. He was in his treatment of women. I found an old photograph of a 1930s committee that he was on at the university and a third of the people in the photograph are women. He had always worked with women in an equivalent role, he never expected women to be the underdogs.”Follows was partially blind in one eye and was therefore ruled out of national service during the second world war but still joined the RAF as a lecturer. After the war that enabled him to become general secretary of Balpa. Meanwhile he succeeded Sir Stanley Rous as secretary of the FA in 1962.It would be one of his last big acts at the FA – he left less than two years later and became chairman of the British Olympics Association in 1977. He saw off intense pressure from Margaret Thatcher’s government to boycott the 1980 Moscow Olympics in protest at the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, defending the right of British athletes to compete at the Games.“Of course it was Seb Coe’s gold medal that year,” she adds. “And he has said himself, I believe, that if it hadn’t been for my father he probably would have never won a gold medal.” Instead, with government funding cut, Follows travelled the length and breadth of the country “trying to raise money for the Olympics, because he was just so desperate for them to be able to do what they wanted to do, without government money at all. And he did it.”His hall of fame induction is on hold due to the coronavirus crisis, but Nottingham’s head of sport, Dan Tilley, is looking forward to recognising his “affinity for student sport, the connection to the university, the fact that he has achieved a huge amount in his career”.Tilley says: “It feels only right that we celebrate him. We push a strong equality and ersity agenda here and it’s nice for our women footballers to reflect on the fact that someone who came through our university lifted the ridiculous ban on women’s football that had been in place since the 1920s. Sometimes sports administrators get overlooked, and actually some of the things they do are quite significant.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf9a090d720bb5ed38a5682071e3254a4bf7e5be/1268_353_2331_1400/master/2331.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=277102e2ebc15908a89cbb6e0a394e7e","title":"carry on leonardo easter lockdown festival pizza oven","story":"From staging a festival to worshipping together to building a pizza oven, we gather your stories“It was like a Carry On film,” says Jane Redman of her family’s attempt to recreate Da Vinci’s Last Supper. Inspired by the recent social media trend, Jane, her husband Chris, their son Nick and daughter Amy – who are all in lockdown together – set themselves an Easter challenge to recreate a classic artwork using things they already had at home.To achieve the image, they took four separate shots in their back garden – changing costumes and poses between each – and then stitched the photos together digitally. “My husband kept saying: ‘We’ve got to be quick because the light keeps changing.’ He was putting us under loads of pressure. We were all wearing different bits of sheet and he was saying ‘Come on, get changed!’ and we’d say ‘Where’s my arm supposed to be? Where am I looking?’ … You’d probably only do it in a lockdown.” As people across the UK must continue to stay at home because of the coronavirus, we asked  readers how they are planning to celebrate Easter in lockdown.Dozens of churchgoers told us that they had discovered new ways to worship together, and will be tuning into online services and prayer meetings.A group called Student Cross has adapted its annual pilgrimage to the Anglican and Roman Catholic shrines in Little Walsingham, Norfolk. “We normally walk in 11 different groups, carrying a cross and stopping to share refreshment and reflections with those we meet,” says Laura Mitcham.But with the pilgrimage cancelled this year, participants can instead go online to log their steps from walking around their home or local area as part of their daily exercise, as well as taking part in daily Zoom liturgy services. “It’s not the same as the physical pilgrimage, says Mitcham, “but it’s something special that will be remembered due to its unique nature and the way the community has pulled together.”Many people across the country are baking hot cross buns and Simnel cakes, decorating houses with homemade ornaments, and organising indoor Easter egg hunts.“My daughter absolutely loves rabbits so Easter is her favourite time of year,” says Rachel Acres from Bradford-on-Avon. On Thursday, she and Bethany, seven, dug out leftover cardboard from their garage to make into giant rabbits and decorate their front garden “to wish all passers-by a happy Easter”.In Cornwall, Sarah Parmenter is staging a mini-festival for her four-year-old son who has loved doing Easter egg hunts with his cousins and friends in previous years. “The bunting will be out, magical Easter egg plants will have grown in the garden and of course the bunny will have visited – apparently he has a special sleigh which allows him to comply with social distancing requirements,” says Parmenter. “We already have an Easter tree decorated with a special sign, reminding the bunny to stop here.”For Millie Jones and her housemates, this weekend marks not only Easter but also the end of their two-week self-quarantine after one started showing symptoms. To celebrate, they’ll have “a very tame blowout” and recreate a typical Christmas day: Bucks Fizz and croissants in the morning, films and chocolate in the afternoon, then a huge roast dinner.“We want to make it as fun as possible,” says Jones. “It feels like we’re all living in the week between Christmas and New Year anyway, so we want to create a festive day, celebrating each other, in this time of lockdown.”Rik Sterken and his family had planned to spend a few nights on the Welsh coast this weekend. Instead, they’re taking a mini-camping trip into their back garden. “We reckon the tent just about fits,” says Sterken. “We’re trying to keep a sense of normality but also a sense of adventure as well.”On Friday night, Sterken, his wife and two children will eat pizzas from their home-built, wood-fired pizza oven for the first time this year, and enjoy barbecued bacon butties on Saturday morning. “The kids are really excited, although we haven’t told them yet they’ll be sleeping on camping mats,” he says.And unable to go to France on holiday, Crista Hazell and her husband Jon will be donning rabbit ears and painting on whiskers to be the Easter bunny for their older neighbours.“We know they can’t see their families so thought we’d help them find a smile on Sunday by placing a few Easter eggs (with clean hands) on doorsteps before the sun rises,” says Crista, an author and education consultant from Bristol. “It’s something a bit daft, but hopefully we can give them a little love and enjoyment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17ca59ba684b4a3f91dda4cd151a23d5f6864958/4_0_4052_2432/master/4052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3c0a79863cda1e7270442e0066f08e1e","title":"i started shouting at the midwives the stress of giving birth under lockdown","story":"Having a baby is always nerve-racking – and women now have unexpected worries to contend with. New mothers share their stories of ‘incredible’ midwives, and the joy and pain of giving birth during a pandemicHelen Simmons, a 28-year-old film producer from London, went into labour with her second child on the evening of 30 March – exactly a week after Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown. “It felt like a 1960s-style birth,” she jokes.She arrived at the Royal Free hospital with her husband, Charles, at 5.30am the following day. “We were hoping for the best,” Simmons says. Instead, Charles was sent home because of new visitor restrictions brought about by the outbreak, and Simmons was sent to a labour ward on her own. She was hungry – she hadn’t brought enough food with her – so Charles dropped some off and stayed with her for a few hours before being ordered to leave again.For the next 10 hours, Simmons was in labour alone and Charles was relegated to a waiting room outside, like a Mad Men-era husband. It was tough. “The hardest bit of labour isn’t the pushing,” Simmons says. “It’s the contractions. And doing that alone … you don’t realise you need your partner so much, emotionally and physically, until you can’t have that person there with you.”After a 30-hour labour, the majority of that time spent alone, their daughter, Isla, was born on 1 April at 4.40am. Charles was allowed in to watch Isla being born before being ushered out. It certainly wasn’t the birth they had hoped for or planned. Yet Simmons feels the experience meant she discovered an inner strength she hadn’t known she had. “It gave me a newfound respect for women through history,” she says.As the coronavirus pandemic continues, pregnant women across the country will be wondering how it will affect them. “It’s an anxious time for pregnant women,” says Maria Booker of the charity Birthrights. “They are concerned about whether their partner can stay with them or what the birth will be like.”At the moment, according to official guidance, no British woman should have to give birth alone. “Visiting is restricted to help stop the spread of coronavirus,” says NHS England, “but our guidance is absolutely clear that a specific exception should be made for birthing partners when a woman is in labour.” The Royal College of Midwives (RCM) guidelines state that partners may not be able to accompany women during their induction and the early stages of labour because of physical distancing guidelines. But it adds: “At the point you go into active labour, you will be moved to your own room and your birth partner will be able to join you.” Provided, of course, they are not showing any signs of illness. No visitors are allowed post-birth.But there is a degree of confusion about how the rules are being enforced by different trusts. Simmons spent most of her labour alone, but others have partners with them throughout. A business owner from London, Naomi Edmondson, 29, gave birth to a baby boy at St Mary’s hospital in Paddington on 31 March. Her husband, Ally, was allowed to stay with her throughout her planned C-section.Emily Botelho, a 30-year-old artist from Manchester, delivered a baby boy safely on 30 March. Her partner, Richard, was allowed to be by her side. But afterwards, she overheard the midwives on her hospital ward discussing the staff shortages. “There was a bit of chatter about one of the maternity wards possibly having to close, as the staff were off sick and self-isolating,” she says.Many trusts are cancelling home and water births because they require more staff. However, Booker says: “We’d ask that trusts think carefully before pulling their home birth services.” She urges them to think creatively about how to work around staff shortages some trusts are using private ambulances to serve their home birth teams, to take the pressure off NHS ambulance crews.Martha San, a 30-year-old personal assistant from London, found out through Facebook that her planned home birth had been cancelled because of a shortage of ambulances. Her midwife had planned to call her, but the news broke online first. San had postnatal depression after her first pregnancy, and had planned a home birth to minimise the chances of her mental health deteriorating. “The idea was to have the baby in an environment I felt comfortable in,” she says.When it came to it, “the birth was great”, says San. Her husband, Jamie, was by her side and baby River arrived safely on 29 March at Lewisham hospital in south London. “The fact I was not at home didn’t matter.” But doctors wanted to keep River in for tests and so San had to spend two nights in hospital alone because Jamie had been sent home. Her ward was noisy, and she couldn’t sleep. At 2am on the second night, San broke down. “I started shouting at the midwives and crying,” San says. “I said that I wasn’t meant to be there, this hadn’t been the plan, I shouldn’t be left alone with the baby and I wasn’t coping.”A midwife moved San to an empty ward so she could get some sleep, and looked after River for a few hours. They were discharged the next morning. But having to spend two nights in hospital alone with a newborn baby was distressing. “It just felt really wrong,” San says. “After the birth, I needed someone there and I didn’t have anyone.”Coronavirus also threw Rachael Collier-Thomas’s birth plans out of the window. The 38-year-old mother from Hertfordshire had planned to have a water birth, but it was cancelled. “When they told me I couldn’t have my water birth, I joked that I’d rather give birth to the baby at home than in a labour ward,” Collier-Thomas says. “But I didn’t actually expect that to happen.”When her waters broke on 24 March, the contractions were so mild that she carried on pottering at home. “I thought I could be like that for days.” A few hours later, Collier-Thomas felt an urge to push. “I thought: it can’t be the baby – it’s too early,” she says. “I haven’t even called the hospital.”Collier-Thomas delivered her daughter, Lottie, on her (formerly) white sofa, with the help of a local doula who had raced around. She is adamant that she didn’t seriously plan to have her daughter at home. “I know that home births can be dangerous,” Collier-Thomas says. “But maybe, subconsciously, I thought: ‘I really don’t want to have my baby on the labour ward.’” Collier-Thomas is not alone: as a result of the coronavirus lockdown, other British women are turning to freebirthing, giving birth without any medical support. Some are concerned about the risk of contracting coronavirus in hospital others have had their planned home births cancelled, and prefer to go it alone, without even midwives on hand. But having your baby at home, without medical supervision, can lead to a greater risk of complications.All the women I spoke to understand the pressures the NHS is under – and are not bitter that their births didn’t go as planned. “It’s hard to be upset,” says Simmons, when your own birth does not go to plan “because there’s so much going on. I totally get it.” Even though San’s hospital stay was upsetting, she has nothing but praise for the midwives doing their best under such difficult circumstances. “They were doing an incredible job,” she says. “But they can’t play the role of midwife and birth partner to every woman on the ward.”The strangeness of giving birth during a pandemic doesn’t end when you get home, though. Given the lockdown, many families won’t meet newborn arrivals for weeks, if not months. Helena (not her real name), a 25-year-old teacher from Edinburgh, gave birth to her first child at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 24 March. “The staff were brilliant,” she says. “Calm and supportive.” But not being able to rely on family or friends for childcare is tough. “We’re first-time parents trying to figure it out, without family for support,” she adds. “It’s stressful and overwhelming.”For some, coronavirus has cast a shadow over a joyful time. “It’s really tainted everything,” says Chloe Goodman, 38, a solicitor from Macclesfield. She gave birth to her daughter, Clara, on 20 March. Goodman describes the care she received at Macclesfield district general hospital as “brilliant”. But she feels upset Clara won’t meet her grandparents for months. “They’re only tiny for such a short period of time,” Goodman says. “They change so quickly.” Helena is also finding things strange. “I should be showing my baby off and going out and seeing people. But, instead, I’m sitting at home, feeling scared.”Many expectant mothers may be contemplating their births with trepidation. And the whisper networks of expecting-mum WhatsApp and Facebook groups can be frightening. “I’d been freaking out before the birth and imagining the worst,” says Edmondson. “But actually being in the hospital was the least worrying part of it all.”Edmondson urges women to ignore the rumour mill, and trust the NHS. “In the hospital, it’s not as bad as everyone says,” she adds. “For me, it was calm, and when you have your baby you’re in this lovely bubble. You’re not paying attention to all the scary stuff people are posting on social media.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a35b881663181acdfec38771bbfe53152cdda9e/13_0_582_349/master/582..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80fb4e7a7de42feefa769cfde375a51d","title":"so long box fresh yeezys from now on wearing gruffalo slippers and boxers romesh ranganathan","story":"It’s as if my mission brief was to stop my wife ever having a feeling of sexual desire for me againI would never have described myself as vain. When I got my first standup spot on television, I returned home to find my wife and mother waiting to stage a hair intervention, immediately taking me to get it cut. I had apparently left it so long that my wife described my look as “recently released political prisoner”. Similarly with clothes: once we had children, I discovered that anything nice had a life expectancy of about an hour before one of them smeared ketchup, snot or a concoction that could only be identified by sending it to a lab, all over it, sometimes accidentally. So, for a long while, I just gave up on wearing nice stuff.Since then, I have started to get my hair cut more frequently and make a sartorial effort. My wife would argue that I have gone too far the other way, as it is fair to say I have developed something of a trainer addiction. I recently wore a box-fresh pair of Yeezys to Chessington World of Adventures, which my wife and kids insisted would lead to the day being ruined by me crying over getting any kind of mark on them. Yeezys are the only fashion item I have ever possessed where, before deciding whether to wear them or not, I have to check the news to see if the designer, Kanye West, has said something twattish.But I ignored my family’s protests. What’s the point of getting nice things if you’re not going to wear them? Half an hour after arriving, a woman in a wheelchair ran over my foot, emblazoning my trainers with a tyre mark, and my family said, “I told you so” a combined total of 1,500 times.What the lockdown has shown me, apart from the importance of not reading the news just before bed, is that I never really left the slob in me behind. Freshly trimmed and smart-clothing Romesh is my Bruce-Banner, and the pants-dwelling, hairy, unkempt, eating-like-an-animal-about-to-go-into-hibernation Romesh has been biding his time until a global pandemic would allow him to re-emerge: the Disgusting Hulk.Obviously, I haven’t had a haircut for ages, but I also haven’t shaved since all this started. At first, I would wear tracksuits and comfy hoodies nice loungewear that, at a push, you might pop to the shops in. Those were the halcyon days. Since then, I have stopped giving any kind of thought to what the outfit looks like, merely ensuring I make some sort of effort to cover my genitals. I have started wearing whatever comes to hand. I type this while wearing a very smart shirt, Gruffalo slippers and boxer briefs. This morning, I walked downstairs in this outfit as if my mission brief was to stop my wife ever having a feeling of sexual desire for me again.Everyone I know has been talking about how they are going to head straight out and aggressively socialise as soon as this is over. I would actively campaign, however, for an extra week or so of lockdown for people to adjust to doing their hair, picking out clothes that are suitable for public consumption, and dressing in a way that won’t lead to arrest. If we don’t have that time allocated, I fear that, for a while, we are going to see people at bars and in shops wearing swimwear and dressing gowns. If that does happen, I will be doing my very best to make shirts, slippers and boxer shorts a thing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a7e561edfcf47ec401b926a24fa34b843435da9/0_352_5331_3199/master/5331..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=793f172553f910c9f309546a656d04d9","title":"the more i stay at home the more grubby it seems","story":"I want a life bigger than my mother’s, yet with her household standards of cleanliness Recently, while practising yoga at home, I had a realisation. I’d like to say it was a spiritual awakening of some sort but unfortunately it was just that my floor was really quite dirty.The more I stay home, the more grubby it seems I notice how the wardrobes bulge and shoes languish. I balk at the use-by dates of tins forgotten on kitchen shelves, repulsed not only by their age but their texture (“Why are things in my kitchen sticky?” I shamefully type into Google). No matter how hard I scrub, I find only more flaws, and no sooner is it cleaned than it all needs doing again.I am appalled, both by my dereliction of domestic duties (wasn’t I raised better than this?) and for seeing it as a dereliction of duty in the first place (haven’t I evolved past this?). It can mean only one thing. I am entering the next phase of modern womanhood – the long, exhausting “Can’t I have it all?” stage – defined by wanting a life bigger than my mother’s while retaining her household standards (how do her sheets always seem whiter, her food tastier?).We all end up here eventually. I have it with my mum, and she with hers. Take sewing: my mum always regretted not learning my grandmother’s excellent seamstress skills (too busy moving to the other side of the world, a previously unavailable opportunity). But my mum can still mend almost anything, whereas I am ashamed I can only raise a hem and fix a button (too busy moving through my career, also a previously unavailable opportunity).Will modern womanhood always be full of such worthless comparisons? I pray someday the cycle breaks. Though I can’t help but chuckle at the thought of my future daughter, wishing she’d learned to fix that button, instead of having to 3D-print an entirely new coat, another previously unavailable opportunity."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b9eab206efd016707dc476776090849764666cf/0_56_5813_3489/master/5813.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e351f625fdec858087bb58a89df551d2","title":"online cookery boom caters to taste for something different","story":"English Heritage’s Kathy Hipperson among chefs enticing people to try new recipes during lockdownHer recipes are sometimes tricky and even alarming. Who has a copper turbot kettle? How do you crush chestnuts through a sieve with a pestle? Who makes macaroni cheese with no sauce?“It is quite dry,” admitted Kathy Hipperson, a historical interpreter who plays the country house Victorian cook Avis Crocombe. “I’d say it’s not horrible, it’s different.”Hipperson is the front person for English Heritage’s online historical cooking demonstrations, one of a number of online cookery programmes that have attracted huge interest in the last few weeks. English Heritage’s offering alone has gone from having a small dedicated following to there being almost 2m views since mid-March.“People are craving something different to watch I think,” said Hipperson. “They want to take their mind off the situation and try something new. I would definitely encourage people to try the recipes.”English Heritage is not alone in seeing a surge in interest in online cookery demonstrations.Nearly 5.5 million people have this week watched Oprah Winfrey on her Instagram page make spaghetti carbonara “for the first time” after she watched Jamie Oliver on YouTube.On Thursday, Winfrey, in California, and Oliver, in Essex, teamed up for an Instagram live stream to make his Singapore-style fried rice together, a recipe made from using up scraps of veg and any bacon, sausage or frozen prawns you might want to use up.Many chefs, stuck in their real kitchen rather than their work one, are also taking to Instagram. Sarit Packer and Itamar Srulovich, the founders of Honey \u0026amp Co, have started their #honeyandcoathome series from their south London home offering a flourless chocolate cake for Passover and hot cross non-denominational buns.Massimo Bottura, the Italian multiple-Michelin award winning chef, is livestreaming his family dinner prep every night. His toasted almond and saba ice cream with a pistachio sauce is not exactly cupboard left-overs but still had more than 200,000 views.Food historian and writer Angela Clutton will on Saturday at 1pm be cooking lamb chops and veg from her kitchen as part of a daily Instagram live series created by Borough Market in London.“There is a lot going on and people have been just so fast in putting these things together,” she said. “It’s because food is always such a great connector, it brings people together and somehow it is still managing to do that even when we can’t actually be together.“I have to say I find it incredibly reassuring.”Crocombe was the real cook at Audley End House in Essex between 1880-84, serving Lord and Lady Braybrooke and their guests. Hipperson has been playing her for more than a decade, part of a team of interpreters putting on live demonstrations in the kitchens as well as the YouTube videos which have now taken off in such a big way.Hipperson said Crocombe had become a phenomenon in the same way people love Downton Abbey. “She was a real person, working in the kitchen and people can relate to her … she’s not a monarch.“I make her as I imagine she would be, quite stern but clearly loving her work. She is quite joyful to watch I think. The fact that we are cooking real historical recipes is a factor too.”The recipes include hearty soups and ice cream made from staple ingredients. Others are a bit more of a performance.For example, turbot à l’anglaise sees Crocombe advising us to get a scullery nmaid to wash and pat dry the fish. She then rubs it with half a lemon, puts it in a turbot kettle and adds water, but not from cistern as it might be stale.Once that’s on the heat, prepare a sauce with some butter, diced lobster and pounded roe and get a kitchen maid to push it through a sieve.Hipperson admitted US audiences “really did not like” the Victorian macaroni cheese recipe which is made from pasta, cheese, breadcrumbs and butter. “You couldn’t get much further away from mac and cheese.”Others are much more straightforward, said Hipperson, such as the queen drop biscuits, cheese seftons and this weekend for Easter, saffron buns. “Some of them are trickier like the apple dumplings, but they are just ine.”Avis Crocombe is one part of a much bigger History at Home hub launched this week by English Heritage, an online resource of videos, podcasts, articles and activity sheets.All its properties are closed but Matt Thompson, head collections curator, hopes the hub will provide distraction and comfort during the lockdown. “For me, it is a 21st-century cabinet of curiosities,” he said.“It is all in one place and we are planning new content. It really helps, I think, to remember that there is so much more outside our own four walls, it is all still there.”Yeast – 4g dried or 10g freshSpicescinnamon, cloves and mace – a pinch of eachLemon – the zest of ½ lemonSaffron – pinch, soaked for 2 hours in 2 tsp warm milkPinch of saltFirst, make a basic bread dough. Combine the flour, sugar, salt, egg and yeast together with enough milk to make a soft, but not sticky dough. Knead for 15-20 minutes and set aside in a warm place, covered with oiled plastic wrap or in a bowl with a cloth over until it has doubled in size (roughly 2-3 hours).Once the dough has risen, remove it and flatten it out slightly. Soak the saffron in the warm milk to get most of the colour out. You can then add add your other ingredients. Put the spices, lemon zest, lard, saffron in its milk (which should now be yellow) and currants in the middle, fold it up, and knead again, folding and squeezing so that the new ingredients are well-incorporated (NB: these days you can also just put everything in a food mixer armed with a dough hook!). Cover again, and leave to double in size once more.Lightly grease two baking sheets and shape your dough into 12 equal buns. Round them off and leave in a covered bowl for 20 minutes to double in size once again.Whilst waiting, create a glaze with an egg, a pinch of salt, and 1 tbsp of milk. When ready, brush over each bun. Then, bake in the oven at 180c350F for 15-20 minutes until each bun is golden brown. Serve on their own, or slathered with butter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cebc399414c1c320f770cb02290f1eca2cb4220e/0_256_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e2af316206caaf2a27662568787ef32","title":"airlines law refunds voucher schemes coronavirus","story":"They are heading for huge losses – and voucher schemes could be a way out of the crisis Since the coronavirus gripped Europe there has been one main theme to the emails pouring into the ’s Consumer Champions column: why is my airline refusing to give me a refund?The rules are quite clear: if a flight is cancelled, the airline has to offer you a refund. The Civil Aviation Authority states explicitly that “If your flight has been cancelled, your airline must offer you the choice of a refund or alternative flight.”But the airlines are trampling all over consumer law and the CAA appears to have abdicated responsibility for enforcing the rules.As we reported earlier in the week, easyJet has removed its refund option from its website, obliging those who don’t want to reschedule to join the lengthy queue for the helpline.My brother has spent many hours fruitlessly trying to call the airline after it cancelled his £800 flight. There’s no way to email the airline, or even an address for post. It’s a matter of take the voucher – or wait endlessly in a call queue.Meanwhile, Ryanair bluntly says it cannot process refunds until the pandemic has subsided, and the best that passengers can hope for, right now, is a voucher valid for 12 months.Cue fury all round? Yes, people are right to be utterly frustrated at this behaviour and the denial of their rights.Yet I have a smidgen of sympathy for the airlines. They are on the peg for huge lease costs on now-grounded planes and are still paying a large chunk of staff costs. They are heading for losses of $252bn (£202bn) should the lockdown last three months, says the International Air Transport Association (Iata). Realistically, how are they going to cash-flow billions of pounds in refunds? It’s not a surprise they are sticking their fingers in their ears and not picking up the phones.Is there a halfway house, a solution that might satisfy the majority of people yet not permanently erode consumer rights?The big problem with vouchers is the restrictions around their use. BA, Ryanair and easyJet say they are valid for 12 months only. Why? What if you don’t plan another journey on a route served by that airline in the next year?Secondly, it lasts five years, not one. Aer Lingus is part of the same company, IAG, as British Airways, so it’s a mystery why BA is not making the same offer.Thirdly, vouchers need to be fully transferable to other iniduals without penalty. So if my brother were to accept a voucher for his cancelled £800 flight, he’d get a £880 voucher that I or someone else will happily pay him £800 for. It’s win-win-win. My brother gets his money back, I get a discount ticket, and the airline does not have to cash-flow a refund.I was asked to volunteer to come off an overbooked £250 BA flight from London to Bangkok in 1997. It offered me a £400 voucher, an overnight hotel at Heathrow and a definite seat the next day. The voucher had no expiry, and six years later I used it during a BA sale to buy two return tickets to New York. It was a total bargain. Vouchers really can work.The banks and credit card companies have offered coronavirus victims payment holidays. In a sense, opting for vouchers is giving a payment holiday to an airline while the business is in an almost impossible financial position.But if we do let the airlines go down this route, it should be time limited, and the usual rules reinstated when normal life resumes.It’s certainly better than a taxpayer-funded bailout, which is what the airlines will demand if their cash runs out.But I write this working from home in an attic room. One of the few joys from the ghastly virus is to look up to a sky brilliantly free from vapour trails. Maybe once the issue of refunds is sorted, the question that will be ever more pressing is whether we should be flying so much anyway."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e9cfce8a807496a6883129da97a75940eac1b85/0_769_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0190fc29960a80f344c88fe2bd411dc4","title":"listeners digest new order where to start back catalogue","story":"In Listener’s Digest, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. Next up: the band who rose from the ashes of Joy Division to wed guitars and dance musicAfter Joy Division singer Ian Curtis took his own life on 18 May 1980, there was never much doubt among the surviving three members – guitarist Bernard Sumner, bassist Peter Hook and drummer Stephen Morris – over whether they’d carry on. However, how do you even begin to replace a singer and lyricist as charismatic and gifted as the subsequently legendary 23-year-old?Shrewdly, they didn’t try. Sumner stepped into the breach as singer, while Morris’s girlfriend, Gillian Gilbert – who had already filled in for Curtis on guitar at a gig at Eric’s in Liverpool after he hurt his hand – was drafted in on guitar and keyboards. This minimised the disruption to the chemistry that produced Unknown Pleasures and Closer – two of the finest albums of the post-punk era – and meant they could become a thoroughly reinvented band, albeit one that still carried Joy Division’s heart and soul.Movement, the 1981 debut, didn’t quite shake off that band’s long shadow, but with Power, Corruption \u0026amp Lies, New Order found their sound. It’s the heavenly hum of guitars and electronics, agony and ecstasy, sunlight bursting through the clouds – and one of the great pioneering albums of the 80s.Here, the SalfordMacclesfield quartet cast off post-punk gloom, head towards the dancefloor and embrace pop. The change is apparent from the opening song, the mighty Age of Consent, as Peter Hook’s euphoric, twangy bass riff leads into a keyboard- and guitar-soaked melodrama. However, PCL is full to bursting with avenues to explore. Side one careers from the mournful We All Stand to the giddy electro-pop of The Village, a distant cousin of 1982’s similarly sequencer-driven single, Temptation. 5-8-6 is electronic dancefloor pop from the same well as Blue Monday. That much-loved 80s classic isn’t on the album (neither New Order nor Joy Division put singles on albums back then), but teed up PCL for a wider audience by becoming the biggest-selling 12-inch of all time.Side two of the album is slightly more statuesque. There’s the shimmering majesty of Your Silent Face (initially titled Kraftwerk 1, in homage to the German electronic predecessors) , the tense Ultraviolence, the electro-vocoder odyssey Ecstasy and sublime, melancholy Leave Me Alone, which shows they could still make new shapes from guitars and drums. It’s a record full of possible futures – for New Order and for pop – and the band’s defining album is the perfect place to start.Blue Monday gave New Order a mainstream audience without entirely shedding the army of Joy Divisionpost-punk era fans (myself included), who wore long overcoats, pretended to read Dostoevsky, scoured record fairs for obscure bootlegs and swapped tapes of soundchecks with their mates. Low-Life (1985) carries off the tricky feat of catering for the different camps of fans. As with Power, Corruption \u0026amp Lies, it unveils a different style with virtually every track. Opener Love Vigilantes – about a returning soldier – is one of the band’s great guitar pop songs. The Joy Division end of the band’s sound is represented by the driving, post-punky Sunrise, a brooding This Time of Night and beautifully, well, elegiac Elegia, an aural memorial to Curtis that appeared years later in an 18-minute version. The newlyacquired Saturday-night-beer-monster fanbase could wobble along to Sub-Culture and Face Up. Possibly best of all, hit single The Perfect Kiss utilises state of the art Emulator sampling technology to produce a dancefloor killer featuring frog croaks.Peter Hook’s book Substance is full of eyebrow-rocketing tales of how New Order recorded their acid-house-era classic in Ibiza, leaving behind a trail of trashed cars, hedonism and fracturing relationships. A battle between the band’s rock and electronic camps over how the album should sound hinted at the growing schisms that led to a 90s hiatus and eventually Hook’s estrangement from the band.Given all this – and the fact that partying took priority over recording until they relocated to Peter Gabriel’s Real World back in the UK – it’s remarkable that they managed to come back with much at all, never mind such a fantastic album. Technique assimilates Balearic beats but is recognisably, inimitably New Order. The band’s most dancefloor album starts off with the acid-house-flavoured Fine Time and ends with the supernaturally melancholy Vanishing Point, while the rest of the album careers from guitar pop (Run, Dream Attack) to plangent electronic pop (Round and Round, Mr Disco), the sound of summer adventures, Ibizan clubs and long, reflective sunsets.Power, Corruption \u0026amp Lies and Low-Life defined New Order as a band who were able to weave together guitars and electronics, a format used by countless bands today. However, Brotherhood separates the two sides again, virtually entirely, with a guitardrums side and an electronic side. Brian Eno had done something similar with the very different halves of Before and After Science, while David Bowie’s “Heroes” ided neatly into rock music and synthesiser stuff. New Order were fans of both, and here they pull off a similar feat.The first side is a Hook masterclass. Having been a huge part of Joy Division’s sound with those mournfulpowerful bass lines, his trademark twangs fire five supremely catchy guitar-pop songs such as the hurtling Weirdo or the truly lovely As It Is When It Was. Side two kicks off with a classic – Bizarre Love Triangle’s soaring symphonic electronic pop – and ends with a rare recorded moment of their idiosyncratic Mancunian humour. As Sumner sings Every Little Counts’ madcap lines – “I think you are a pig, you should be in a zoo” – he can’t stop laughing. It’s a long way from their roots, but, if you like these albums, head back to Movement and Joy Division to listen to where they started out.New Order didn’t travel to Maida Vale studios in London to record their second session for John Peel’s Radio 1 show – the standard practice, which they followed for their first one. But perhaps recording the four tracks in Manchester gave them room to experiment. The skeletal, minimalist, embryonic version of 5-8-6 is barely recognisable as the pop song it became later. The haunting, melancholy version of We All Stand is arguably superior to the one featuring 80s fretless bass on Power, Corruption \u0026amp Lies. The anxiously mournful synth- and bass-driven Too Late is a terrific lost New Order classic, which was never played live or recorded elsewhere. The oddest curiogem is an unlikely but sublime melodica-driven cover of Jamaican artist Keith Hudson’s 1975 reggae song, Turn the Heater On, which led Peel to remark: “Skank with New Order.” It’s a wonderful remake of a song apparently loved by Ian Curtis, and this session is as fine a 20 minutes of music as New Order have recorded. It’s being reissued as an EP for Record Store Day this year.Substance: Inside New Order by Peter Hook (2016)As its title suggests, the now former New Order bassist’s weighty memoir reveals all about the excess, ruckuses and recriminations behind the scenes. Some revelations about how the seminal music was created also crop up in a once top-secret cache of drink, drugs and debauchery.Record Play Pause by Stephen Morris (2019)The New Order drummer’s first volume of memoirs combines humour, geek-level detail and insider insight in a terrific read that’s especially good on the environment and chemistry that produced Joy Division (and hence New Order). A second volume on the New Order years and fall-outs, due later this year, promises to be similarly gripping.From Heaven to Heaven by Dec Hickey (2010)If you can find it, this originally limited hardback is a beautifully designed and presented pictorial and text record of New Order’s early live years, 1981-84. Hickey was one of the few fans to access the then cult band at close quarters, and his eagle-eyed recollections are accompanied by input from Hook, Morris and journalist Paul Morley.

It’s a welcome distraction in lockdownEveryone who’s taken part so far has said it’s like doing a gig. There’s the trepidation beforehand, then an hour of craziness, and finally a period where you’re kind of decompressing. The only difference with this is that nobody’s nicking your beers!We’ve done about 30 so far, including our debut album Some Friendly, and there have been some great moments. My personal highlight is me not realising that I’d played Reading festival in 1999 – I still can’t remember it now, even though people have been telling me exactly what happened.I also loved Dave Rowntree revealing his collection of laminated artefacts from the Parklife era – old photos, gig tickets. He made so much effort and that really upped everything because the listening party became a visual thing. The Cribs did one for Men’s Needs, Women’s Needs, Whatever and were showing their old tour diaries and lyric sheets. Those are the kind of insights you don’t often get in a magazine – bands probably wouldn’t want to show those at the time of release anyway, but now there’s a bit of history involved and they feel more relaxed.What I like is that it’s giving people the opportunity to listen to an album in its entirety again. Musicians I talk to, even the younger artists, all want to make an album that’s a masterpiece, that has a theme running through it, a start and a finish. That has been crushed in a way because people felt they didn’t have enough time on their hands. But now all we have is time, so it’s a beautiful thing for this moment.We’ve had listeners from all over: New Zealand, Japan and even Antarctica. Part of the reason we do them at 10pm is because that’s when Japan is waking up. The other reason is because that’s when the 10 o’clock news is on, and I wanted people to have an alternative to that – you can watch the news at any time these days this is a way of offering up an alternative good time instead.It’s not the only thing I’m doing at the moment. I’ve got a new solo album, I Love the New Sky, coming out in May. I spoke to the label about whether we should postpone it, but we agreed it was a good time to put music out, to have something to look forward to. I’ve also been doing some home schooling with my six-year-old. But I’m not a teacher and I don’t think I should try to be. Instead we just go for a walk every day and talk about volcanoes, tornadoes, the coronavirus and the environment. That’s not a bad start, is it? He’s also got into wrestling, so we do a bit of that.But most of my time is spent on these listening parties. I’m always working on them. All day I’m getting direct messages and emails and I’m normally up until midnight answering questions. The listening party itself keeps you on your toes. I usually have a few tweets lined up beforehand – that way I can answer everyone’s questions while it’s live. It’s hard to keep up. There’s so many people out there saying things like “where are we now?” and I have to be on hand to say “two minutes and 34 seconds into track four ... no, it’s two minutes and 36 seconds now!”It’s growing every day. We could keep this going until Christmas. Sleaford Mods have just said they want to do all of their albums, every Thursday at 8pm. That’s what I love about it, it’s all about impulsive decisions and it spirals into a thing of its own.When I was first starting out, I would listen to Harvest by Neil Young to learn how to write songs. That was more of a conscious thing, but I’m sure listening to all these classic albums will affect my songwriting in some subliminal way. Hopefully it will, and you won’t ever get to hear that song I wrote about washing your hands."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87c33812b429f365e027c4f124acdb26abb360df/0_0_7288_4371/master/7288..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4abdbddc41c0954e542d549917c9b35","title":"world health organization who v coronavirus why it cant handle pandemic","story":"Attacked by Trump and ignored by many of its most powerful members, the World Health Organization is facing a major crisis – just at the moment we need it most. By  Stephen BuranyiIf, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World Health Organization’s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings. Tedros, as he is known, is a calming presence in the midst of the crisis. Flanked by an international cast of scientists, he always seems confident that if we have hope, listen to the experts and pull together, we will get through this.Watching this reassuring spectacle, it is possible to imagine a world in which every nation respects the WHO’s authority, follows its advice and lets it coordinate the flow of information, resources and medical equipment across national boundaries to areas of greatest need.That is not the world we live in. “The W.H.O. really blew it. For some reason, funded largely by the United States, yet very China centric,” tweeted Donald Trump on 7 April, summing up just one of the many lines of criticism the WHO is currently facing. It is not just Trump – even some of the WHO’s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. “You’ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn’t want to exercise its authority,” said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO’s leaders are “very frustrated,” said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO’s emergency committee. “The messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.”On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of “alarming levels of inaction” from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO’s Covid-19 response, demurred. “You know who you are,” he said, adding that “we don’t criticise our member states in public”.There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of “losing the dressing room”, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.The WHO “has been drained of power and resources”, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. “Its coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.”At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. “All the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what’s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “None of us know where this is leading.”The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new – in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever – but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than “the attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health”.One of the WHO’s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn’t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the bifurcated needle, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn’t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address – smallpox, yellow fever and the plague – had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIVAids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China’s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.Given the WHO’s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. “I was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,” she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. “If the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it’s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,” she said. “We are working for humanity.”Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland’s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO’s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a “strange contagious disease” that had already killed 100 people, but which was “not allowed to be made known to the public”. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn’t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained “if the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage” and exhorting the Chinese to “let us come in as quickly as possible!” With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. “After her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,” said Heymann.In March 2003, as the disease spread – reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada – for the first time in its history, the WHO issued advice against travelling to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. “Passengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,” said Heymann.The WHO’s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or “non-pharmaceutical interventions” in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO’s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. “Brundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,” said Fidler. “She sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.”“After Sars, the WHO’s position was essentially: that was great, let’s formalise it,” said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the International Health Regulations (IHR), the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, “fake”), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO’s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. “The WHO isn’t Nato, it’s not the security council,” said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO’s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 911, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. “WHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of ‘What if that was us in China’s spot?’,” explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don’t want to be told what to do.If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative – very un-Brundtland-like – in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or “swine flu”. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response – less aggressively than during Sars – and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO’s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll – 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide – was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. “Suddenly you have people saying: ‘Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,’” says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and “cost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily”, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. “The WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,” said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)Fidler, who largely approves of WHO’s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. “There was a big funding shortfall,” said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. “Cuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.” The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO’s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations deployed more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries – Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone – paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists judged the WHO’s response an “egregious failure”.Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens’ health. “She wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency – more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,” said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO’s leadership had shown they “no longer had any faith in their authority”.Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. “In my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,” said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting “a very powerful hold” on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently told Fox News that the Chinese government had “used the WHO to mislead the world”, and claimed that the WHO “is either complicit or dangerously incompetent”. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of “helping Communist China cover up a global pandemic”. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of politicising the virus.)Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. “China likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,” said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.John MacKenzie, the WHO’s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was “a little misled” about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn’t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. “That’s very slow,” MacKenzie told me. “For at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.” MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week – 59 in the week ending 5 January – was “nowhere near as many cases as you’d expect”. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some reports suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)Despite mounting frustrations – in mid-January, China also refused the WHO’s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak – Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is “setting a new standard for outbreak control”. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros’s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a “really nasty” election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros’s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro’s backers even accused Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros denied the claim, describing it as a “last-minute smear campaign”, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros’s supporters mounted “a collective pushback”, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that “seemed carved out of a rock”, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different – jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. “He is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,” said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. “He’s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.”“I don’t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,” said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. “He needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.” Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that “his high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.” He went on to note, though, that this strategy “does risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.”If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility – overlooking China’s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February – and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China’s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan claimed that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China – which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has more cases of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. “I don’t think we will see the US government cut off funding,” said Fidler. “But what’s happened with this pandemic – with the WHO caught between the USChina rivalry – is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.”While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, “countries, especially western countries, didn’t listen. Or didn’t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.” On 5 February, the WHO asked for $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March – a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond – was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. “They declared a pandemic because countries weren’t taking the advice,” said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Inidual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases – a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: “Test test test” and “solidarity solidarity solidarity”.But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO’s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of “herd immunity”. The US didn’t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. In Sweden, restaurants are still open.Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up. Earlier this year, for instance, the NHS ordered millions of masks from a French company named Valmy SAS. But in early March, the French government requisitioned all masks produced within the country, so the masks never reached Britain. This week, Germany accused the US of seizing a shipment of masks bound for Berlin from a port in Thailand while Germany previously sent inspectors to the factory of an American company in Jüchen to ensure their medical masks weren’t being exported against government orders.The WHO is battling against a breakdown in international cooperation that is far beyond its capacity to control. “Governments have retreated to national policies, and this problem predates this crisis,” said Clare Wenham, the health scholar. States have been turning away from international institutions for a long time. The WHO hasn’t driven globalisation in the same way as the WTO or IMF, but in a way it has administered it – quietly promising to take on the outbreaks that arise in an industrialised and interconnected world, and relying on the often unspoken norms of international collaboration that underlie it.Ironically, it is most needed now, at a time when faith in the other administrators and overseers of the global order are in decline – a trend that Covid-19 only seems to be accelerating. “As it’s gone on, you see the WHO becoming less important,” said Wenham. “No one is thinking about reducing the global numbers, only their own. The WHO is a global force, but people aren’t thinking globally.”• Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, and sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d41a862c8dd6cf45aae911bda399c29c028be0/0_0_6044_4029/master/6044.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=078d95362c0cb9d64dc83dcbc0c6e633 1400w","title":"tracy brabin phone number itv this morning coronavirus","story":"Labour MP was discussing coronavirus funding to cover closure of constituency offices Tracy Brabin has said she will have to change her phone number after it was inadvertently shown on screen during an appearance on ITV’s This Morning.The Labour MP for Batley and Spen, who is a former Coronation Street actor, appeared on the show to discuss funding being made available for MPs to cover the costs of closing their constituency offices.As she appeared via FaceTime, her phone number appeared across the top of the screen.

What options are available?Young workers are among the most resilient to the virus, but often the hardest hit financially. A “youth first” policy would aim to release them first, at least in part, so they can get back to work and soften the financial impact of the epidemic. Research from Warwick University this week made the case for easing restrictions on people in their 20s and 30s who no longer live with their parents. Andrew Oswald and Nattavudh Powdthavee estimate that the move would allow 4.2m people to return work, 2.6m of whom are in the private sector, and get the economy moving again. “A young workforce release of this kind would lead to substantial economic and societal benefits without enormous health costs to the country,” the authors write.As recent deaths have shown, however, the young are not impervious to the disease. The Warwick group calculate that their youth-first policy could lead to 630 premature deaths. But if all goes well, others could follow them back to the workplace, their order determined by age and type of work.Shutting schools reduces the spread of coronavirus among pupils and teachers breaking up the social bonds that inevitably build up between parents. But it has a significant impact on economic activity, as so many working parents need time off for childcare and home schooling.An influential review published this week found a “remarkable dearth” of data on the value of school closures during the outbreaks of Sars and Mers, but noted that the measure seemed to have relatively little impact on the spread of those coronaviruses.Government to back £330bn of loans to support businesses through a Bank of England scheme for big firms. There are loans of up to £5m with no interest for six months for smaller companies.Taxes levied on commercial premises will be abolished this year for all retailers, leisure outlets and hospitality sector firms.Britain’s smallest 700,000 businesses eligible for cash grants of £10,000. Small retailers, leisure and hospitality firms can get bigger grants of £25,000.Government to increase value of universal credit and tax credits by £1,000 a year, as well as widening eligibility for these benefits.Statutory sick pay to be made available from day one, rather than day four, of absence from work, although ministers have been criticised for not increasing the level of sick pay above £94.25 a week. Small firms can claim for state refunds on sick pay bills.Local authorities to get a £500m hardship fund to provide people with council tax payment relief.Mortgage and rental holidays available for up to three months.More sophisticated options are available than simply reopening schools en masse, which would risk fuelling a second wave of infections. A more cautious approach may see schools staggering their opening hours, lunch and break times, keeping playgrounds closed and class groups constant, introducing more space between students and having a shorter school week.There is a case for opening primary schools first: they tend to be smaller than secondaries and it is predominantly younger children who keep adults from working. That said, the impact of closures on mental health and education are more severe for secondary students.“One problem is that we don’t have much information to guide us,” said Professor Russell Vine at UCL, an author of the review. “We need to get the clever modellers looking at this, and looking at how these might interact with other elements. But I think society also need to discuss it.” Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200408-57750-gnl.sci.20200409.ms.covid_19_lockdown.mp3 Britain desperately wants an effective antibody test that reveals who has had the virus. Those who test positive for coronavirus antibodies will presumably have some immunity and in principle might be allowed back to work. It could make a dramatic difference for NHS staff and other carers who work with vulnerable people.Immunity passports are not straightforward, though. A positive antibody test does not mean someone is well protected, or protected for long. What the immune response means in the case of this particular disease is still unknown. Another concern with immunity passports is that they blur the rules of the lockdown and encourage others to take the restrictions less seriously.A gradual easing of restrictions on shops and businesses would help the economy, but the spectre of a second wave of infections is ever present. Certain types of shops could reopen, but with strict limits on hours and numbers. The construction and manufacturing industries have already been sent new guidance from Alok Sharma, the business secretary, who said work could continue if done in line with social distancing rules “wherever possible”.Health officials will be watching European countries that are stating to relax their own lockdowns. In Austria, where new cases have been falling for some days, the schools will remain closed, but small shops, DIY and garden centres are due to reopen after Easter.• Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/506390da2f8b0e51e11d286c581d64db3b3ac8a0/481_175_1468_881/master/1468.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95159c72ea2dbe4cac415936ae4c0879","title":"ap mccoy grand national dont push it interview","story":"Ten years to the day since he won on Don’t Push It, does AP McCoy feel like a decade has passed since his greatest achievement?“It’s scary how quick these things go,” says Sir Anthony McCoy, reflecting on the fact it is 10 years to the day on Friday since he won the Grand National on Don’t Push It, widely regarded as the crowning achievement of his extraordinary career in the saddle. Now 45, the jockey who never really wanted to quit is five years into retirement and well established in a new career as a TV pundit.Does it feel like a decade has passed? He laughs down the phone. “Some days, yeah. I woke up this morning, me back was sore. I thought, yeah, it does feel like 10 years ago.” The great man is lucky enough to have horses at home and a bit of land he can work on in this time of lockdown. The only thing he has driven for a fortnight is a JCB, which he is using to put in new drains and to improve his gallops. He sounds almost grateful to be taking a break for a bit of reminiscing.The Grand National was the race that made AP wait, long after he had come to dominate jump racing by sheer force of will. A bit of back pain would be the least he would expect in the mornings back then, when it sometimes seemed he was held together by the silks he was wearing. But however battered he might look he could be relied on for another three winners at Taunton before driving to Sedgefield to do it again the next day. He was champion for an unbroken, unprecedented 20-year spell.“I’ve won a few races nobody knows about,” he joked at the time. Anyone who followed jump racing knew exactly what he was achieving, and punters in particular loved his unquenchable thirst, believing he would never give up, even if he had 20 lengths to make from the fourth-last in a selling hurdle at Market Rasen.But, in terms of his standing with the wider public, there was a nagging sense that his thousands of winners might not add up to a whole lot if he couldn’t do it on the one day each year when they were watching. “I was lucky enough to have done a lot of other things in racing,” he says. “I’ll always say the Gold Cup is the pinnacle of it, but if you tell the man in the street that you’re a jockey, they want to know if you’ve won the Grand National.“I used to comfort myself, thinking, look at the lads: John Francome, Jonjo O’Neill, Peter Scudamore, Charlie Swan, Frank Berry – multiple champion jockeys who never won a National. I used to think every day: ‘Ah well, they didn’t win the National so I’m not in bad company, they’re better than I was.’ And there were a lot of lads that definitely weren’t as good as any of those that did win the National …”Shoring up your self-confidence is important if you are to last as a professional athlete, so those rationalisations were absolutely necessary as the years rolled by and Aintree kept baring its teeth at McCoy. It took him six rides in the race before he completed the course and even that required him to remount Blowing Wind, who was balked by a loose horse at the 19th and dropped his jockey in the ditch.Four years later, another loose horse carried Clan Royal off the course when he was leading at Becher’s Brook the second time round. That was McCoy’s 10th ride in the National. The next four years were not quite so traumatic but still fruitless. Oh, well. Some things just aren’t meant to be.The 2010 race did not seem to hold particular promise. A few weeks beforehand, McCoy was mulling over a choice of four mounts and did not seem especially thrilled by any of them, though he was prepared to make allowances for Don’t Push It’s flop at the Cheltenham Festival.“There were other Grand National mornings that I was more excited, like before I was riding Blowing Wind or Clan Royal or Butler’s Cabin. I’d genuinely thought they might win.” Don’t Push It had had his moments, even in defeat, like the 2006 novice chase when McCoy had told the owner JP McManus: “He’ll win today.” They were beaten three parts of a length by some beast called Denman, who hammered Kauto Star in the Gold Cup 16 months later.Jonjo O’Neill, trainer of Don’t Push It, needed little prompting to reel off a list of the horse’s ailments, including “kissing spines and bad stifles”. McCoy described his mount as “mentally unstable”. They tried ear plugs as a means of keeping him calm during the buildup but he still sweated up at the start.It was at about this point that David Casey, on Snowy Morning, noticed from a bookmaker’s board that Don’t Push It had halved in price from the morning 20-1 as casual punters lined up behind his famous rider. Casey pointed it out to McCoy and asked mischievously: “How are you going to explain getting beat on another Grand National favourite?” Relaxed and with no great expectations, McCoy joined in the joking. But when the tape went up a few minutes later it didn’t take long for things to become interesting.“I genuinely thought, going out on the second circuit: ‘My God, this horse is loving this.’ I was thinking, well you’re not going to win if you get brought down, so keep him out of the way of everything else, try and get him round and if you’re there at the Canal Turn …“I couldn’t believe how he turned there, really tight. From there, I thought, fuck, this horse could win.” The one still to beat was Black Apalachi, but that rival had helped force a strong pace from an early stage, a detail that had not escaped the hawk-eyed McCoy as he smuggled Don’t Push It into contention. The runner-up proved remarkably game but there was little doubt about the outcome for the last quarter-mile.“There was a lot of relief and obviously a lot of satisfaction,” says McCoy, whose post-career status is undoubtedly higher because he finally conquered Aintree. To his way of thinking, he achieved much more in breaking Sir Gordon Richards’s 55-year-old record for winners in a season. “But it would never have led to people very kindly voting for me to win something like Sports Personality of the Year.“That’s the difference. There were 4.8 million watching the virtual Grand National the other day. Only 1.2 million watched the Gold Cup, which is the best race of the year. What’s the world coming to? The Grand National is a Wimbledon, it’s an FA Cup, one of those marquee events that will always be more powerful than all the others.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e661386071b4e6e9415b3b3830b71c31fd2936ae/665_348_2708_1625/master/2708.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef2053793554f3ca4d058d60f205c563","title":"my favourite game sporting gijon v real oviedo january 1997","story":"As we got closer to Gijón, Sporting fans were throwing things at the train. It wasn’t a great game but it was quite an experience“Blue, if they’ve got one.”It didn’t make a lot of sense … at least not until we got off the train a few days later. Turned out Jaime was right. When a small group of us said we were going to the Asturian derby between Sporting Gijón and Real Oviedo, his response was to buy a hard hat. We hadn’t and we were exposed.Not that we were the only ones. Not all of the thousand or so fans travelling there wore helmets but there might have been a couple of hundred when they arrived at the station in Oviedo that afternoon. In the mind’s eye it is more, and a lot of them are covered with football stickers. Looking back, that derby might not even be a good thing, something to hang on to, still less to celebrate, but it doesn’t go away.First, an apology: the headline in La Nueva España that morning called it the “greatest show on earth, more than a match”, but in fact it wasn’t much of a match at all, still less a great game, confirmation of what one report called a “tendency to nil-nilism”.Well, they did say favourite and this did come to mind, a memory crystallising in that piece of sartorial advice and the essential silliness of it all.This was huge, friends in Oviedo had said. Rooting out the reports now says so too. The match preview opened with the line “at last the day arrives”.That day was a Sunday in January 1997 and they loaded us – too many of us – on to a train to Gijón, 35km away. A football special, no one else on board and no other way to go. Packed in and unable to move, glasses of piss passed along precariously and chucked out of the window. Songs hammered out on the ceiling and the sides, even if we didn’t know all of the words.As we got closer to Gijón, some Sporting fans waited on the platforms of stations the train sped through – Veriña and La Calzada at a guess, looking at the map 23 years later – and threw things, thudding against the side.It pulled into Gijón and the police boxed us in on all sides and ran us to the stadium all along the beachfront, three kilometres covered quickly. A few rocks flew, a bottle or two, hence the helmets, yet mostly it was insults and not much else – most tongue in cheek, accepted and reciprocated. They welcomed us and we proposed a swap deal for the UK: Gibraltar for Gijón. They never did take us up on that.We kept running, all the way to the Molinón, where the mayor of Oviedo said the city’s team played “beautifully”. He insisted: “This isn’t football, this is poetry.” He was only half right, another politician telling porkies, and six years on Oviedo fans had more reason to hate him than anyone in Gijón when he proposed to put the club out of business and they rose up to rescue it. Yet if anyone deserved anything that day it probably was Oviedo.Managed by Juanma Lillo, they had two goals disallowed and a penalty turned down in the 0-0 draw. Peter Dubovsky, rest his soul, hit the bar. Lillo wasn’t happy about the ref but he doesn’t linger in my mental version, which is more in line with the match ratings for the two keepers: “Ablanedo: not a game with much work.” And “Mora: more relaxed than he could have imagined.” In fact, the game almost doesn’t exist – beating double-winning Atlético 4-1 that year, now that was a game – but nor does it matter. It was the experience, the discovery, the something.The president of the principality admitted that there “hadn’t been much football”. It had, though, “been a great party”, and now there was a train to catch home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd3c74de5a33618be726bc41db1416afb78795af/91_45_2993_1796/master/2993.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f0790d21b2be90965d2959862f5f399","title":"the masters tiger woods 2019 comeback unforgettable success augusta","story":"No one who witnessed the American’s astounding comeback victory at Augusta in 2019 is likely to forget what they sawThe propensity of the Masters to deliver moments in time is beyond golfing parallel. They needn’t always arrive at the tournament’s 72nd hole. If the Hogan Bridge, Butler Cabin and Magnolia Lane define Augusta National, its celebrated tournament also has reference points throughout the sprawling acreage.When Ian Poulter is taken back to the Masters Sunday of 2019, he recalls his view from the 13th tee. Poulter was one of a quartet from the tournament’s closing two groups – each consisting of three players, unusually – to find water at the 12th. Behind him Tiger Woods played safe on the world’s most famous par three and found dry land.“I looked across as he hit his shot into the middle of the green and from that point he had control of what he was doing,” says Poulter. “It was inevitable.”“It” was a 15th major championship, Woods’s first since 2008 and a conquest for which words barely deliver justice. The intervening 11 years had witnessed adultery shame, fitness woes and a form slump that triggered the widespread depiction of a fallen hero. Tremors reverberated beyond sport as this instantly recognisable figure conjured the ultimate redemption tale amid wild, uncharacteristic celebration.Courtesy of a win in 2013, Adam Scott has automatic entry to one of sport’s most exclusive spaces: the champions’ locker room at Augusta National. Having signed off with a 73 for a share of 18th, 12 months ago, Scott seized an unexpected opportunity. The Australian discovered “seven or eight” past Masters champions gathered round a television. “I came in having finished and they were all sitting there,” says Scott. “I thought: ‘This is cool.’ I mean, you don’t all hang out that much. You don’t get that group of people together very often. There was definitely a fraternity feeling. Everyone was very excited that Tiger was doing what he was doing.“As I was finishing my round you got a sense, as he was taking the lead on the back nine, that something special could be happening. There’s always an electricity in the air at Augusta on a Sunday, but then when Tiger or certain people are in the mix there’s something more. All of us were definitely cheering hard for Tiger to win. You just had that sense it was a significant moment in the sport again.”This was no standard Masters denouement even before Woods set pulses racing. Storms forecast for Augusta ensured early tee times and those three-balls as opposed to pairs. Woods started day four two shots adrift of Francesco Molinari, tied with Tony Finau and one ahead of Brooks Koepka. “We had never really been in contention on the last day of the Masters so it didn’t feel ‘different’ for us,” says Ricky Elliott, Koepka’s caddie, of a dawn alarm call.From a personal nadir – Woods was found by police slumped behind the wheel of his car in May 2017 and charged with driving under the influence – there had been traces of a full professional recovery. Woods won the Tour Championship at East Lake in late 2018. Shortly before the Masters, Woods knocked Rory McIlroy out of the WGC Match Play in Texas. “He played very well,” says McIlroy. “I could see him as one of the Masters favourites on the back of what I saw there. He was driving the ball better. With how good his iron play is, if he drives it well he will always have a great chance at Augusta.” Woods had Georgia on his mind all right. “Augusta started probably back in October, November,” he said last February of his Masters planning.You cannot win the Masters on Thursday or Friday but you can sure as hell lose it. A 70 and a 68 had Woods one stroke from the halfway lead, held by a quintet including Scott, Molinari and Koepka. “There wasn’t much conversation with Tiger during those first two rounds,” says Jon Rahm, one of his playing partners. “But that isn’t unusual at a major.”A Saturday pairing with Poulter led people to highlight the “new” Tiger. In 2018 the duo were also third-round companions but nowhere near Masters contention. “He shot five under, I shot four under and I played great,” says the Englishman. “At that point I was thinking: ‘If I can have another day like that I might have a chance.’ He was ready, he had all the shots and was pretty damn good. He had more of his game together than a year earlier, by a mile. There was a buzz out there all day Saturday. Playing with him was fun, but you could sense he was lurking.”Poulter had Koepka and Webb Simpson for company in the penultimate group. Koepka’s threat to Woods was obvious: the Floridian arrived at the 83rd Masters having won on two of his previous three major outings. With Molinari holding a two-stroke lead, Koepka and Woods were level at 11 under par before disaster, namely Rae’s Creek, struck for the reigning US Open and US PGA champion at the 12th.“We were a couple behind Frankie so I think Brooks felt he had to do more and changed his line a little bit,” explains Elliott. “He maybe lost a bit of patience. If he had been in the last group and seen everyone in front dunk it in the water he might have thought differently.”Molinari’s horrid capitulation also started at Golden Bell. The Italian, who brushed Woods aside en route to Open Championship glory the previous July, shared fifth from such a commanding earlier position. “Having the Claret Jug and winning a major not long before already told me I was able to do it,” Molinari says. “In some ways it made the disappointment a little bit bigger that time I wasn’t able to close it out.”Elliott can reel off Koepka’s closing stretch as if it were yesterday. “Eagles 13, great chance at 14 and left it short, 15 I thought he had holed it for eagle, 16 the ball just stayed above the slope ...” The key, though, is that Koepka was “right back in it”. Woods delivered a crushing blow to all the young pretenders with a glorious for-the-ages tee shot at the par three 16th, almost resulting in a hole-in-one. The Olympic swimming legend Michael Phelps, in the gallery directly behind Woods, was among those caught in the moment.Elliott adds: “We were on the 17th tee when Tiger’s shot came in. We were pin high, standing on tip toes watching it. It looked like it was going in the hole. So it’s incredible to be there, in that moment even though Brooks was still in the hunt. Tiger now had a two-shot lead but that’s no gimme at Augusta.“We were playing catch-up all day and it didn’t really feel like we gave it away. In hindsight, if he had holed a couple of putts it could have been a backdoor win. We were never ahead, always behind, so we weren’t kicking doors in afterwards. It was an unbelievably exciting day.”Woods’s playing of the last was conservative. And rightly so. A bogey five would be sufficient for victory, meaning the champion-in-waiting found himself short and right of the putting surface in two. “When I was walking up on the green, to see my family and friends there through the chute, I started to get a little bit emotional,” Woods says. “I had to rein it back in and say: ‘Hey, it’s not quite over yet.’”When it was, Woods couldn’t anticipate he would have to wait at least 19 months for a title defence. Through horrible, unforeseen circumstances, this somehow manages to add to the allure of what transpired on 14 April 2019. An enduring story has been allowed a broader canvas. No one who witnessed this will ever forget it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e7ae60c266f5072136792649449c80aaaa5ca63/185_336_3249_1950/master/3249.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ceb99e2235326192a012106c2353950a","title":"tokyo games chief says postponed olympics not certain to go ahead in 2021","story":"There can be no guarantee the postponed Tokyo Olympics will take place next year, the chief executive of the Games has admitted.Tokyo 2020 became the most prominent sporting casualty of the coronavirus pandemic a fortnight ago when it was pushed back from July to the summer of 2021. The continuing spread of the virus means even that date is uncertain, according to the head of the Tokyo Organising Committee, Toshiro Muto.“We have made the decision to postpone the Games by one year. So this means all we can do is work hard to prepare for the Games. We sincerely hope that come next year mankind will manage to overcome the coronavirus crisis.”Less than a month ago the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, insisted the Games would go ahead “without problem as planned” this summer. On 24 March he reluctantly agreed a postponement with the president of the International Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach. Abe’s critics said he had been slow to act because of the significance of the Games to his political plans.On Tuesday Abe announced a state of emergency that would give some regional governments, including Tokyo, power to curtail movement and close nonessential businesses. The measures stopped short of those employed in many other countries and were described as “not enough” by the governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike.It is under that cloud of uncertainty that Muto made his remarks, with the chief executive admitting he was unsure whether insurance arranged by the organising committee would cover the current circumstances. “Tokyo 2020 has taken out several insurance policies,” he said, “but whether the postponement of the Games qualifies as an event that is covered is not clear yet.”The effects of a delayed Olympic Games are not being felt only in Japan. Several British sporting bodies face financial difficulties following the postponement. While funding from the central body UK Sport has already been allocated some organisations were reliant on additional funding generated through sponsorship deals, money which has dried up because of the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48c00b116e470149a03bc2ccdb64a8a552e6b01c/0_0_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5027d21a8137d0835556977caf6c424b","title":"amsterdam to paris in 90 minutes dutch tout hyperloop as future of travel","story":"North Holland thinks unproven 600mph magnetic hovertrain could help replace air travelSwifter than trains, safer than cars and far less damaging to the environment than planes, the Dutch province of North Holland believes the hyperloop might be the future.Plans are being drawn up for Amsterdam to be connected to other European cities by the futuristic high-speed mode of transportation comprising a magnetic hovertrain in an air-free tube able to travel at speeds of over 600mph due to the lack of friction and drag.A study carried out by a Dutch technology startup, Hardt Hyperloop, in collaboration with the province, has found the hyperloop could reduce commuting times from Amsterdam to Paris, Brussels, Düsseldorf or Frankfurt from “hours to minutes”, boasting that “borders would, quite literally, become blurred”.Commuters stepping into a hyperloop pod in Amsterdam could arrive in Brussels in under 30 minutes or in Paris in 90 minutes rather than the current three and half hours, the study suggests.It is yet to be seen how the coronavirus pandemic will affect the transnational project at a time when borders are being shut and an economic recession is widely predicted.In addition, the practicality of the hyperloop has been questioned ever since the entrepreneur Elon Musk suggested back in 2013 that the aerodynamic pods could be the future of high-speed travel for passengers and freight, given its relatively low energy use.Questions have been raised about its value for money, with critics adamant that incremental changes to current transport are a better bet than inventing a fifth mode to join cars, trains, boats and planes. Australia is the latest to reject it in favour of tried and trusted high-speed rail.But Jeroen Olthof, the deputy responsible for mobility in North Holland, said he had been impressed by the possibility of creating a “compact region” of five European cities in which commuters could travel door-to-door within an hour.Not only would Amsterdam be served by a larger workforce but the drop in demand for short-haul flights from Schiphol airport could lead to a reduction of about 20,000 to 24,000 aircraft movements in 2040, it is claimed.Olthof said: “We know that people are willing to travel from door to door for up to one hour for their work. With such a super-fast hyperloop, it suddenly becomes possible to travel much longer commuting distances. That sounds promising.“That is why we are going to consult with other authorities and parties to continue this research.”Hardt Hyperloop, which was founded after winning the international hyperloop competition organised by Musk in 2017, is partnering with companies including Tata Steel on the project.A first high-speed test facility is being built in the Dutch province of Groningen with a three kilometre test track, making it the first in Europe of its kind. A 30 metre low-speed test tunnel has already been built in Delft.Hardt Hyperloop has been looking at how its passenger-carrying pods – which will be propelled through a tube – might also be able to change routes by switching lanes without reducing speed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9268bbaf07368817b86df4c06e1ba2df4d045cd/1_0_2601_1562/master/2601..jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e25184c2d9aaa983a5f5acd01cc4a4b8","title":"dont let a weak bladder stop you doing the things you love","story":"Avoiding playing vigorous sports? Sex life gone from G-spot to pee spot? The London Clinic’s Jane Simpson explains what we can do to tackle incontinence – including kegel exercises that you can do wherever you are As a continence nurse specialist, I’ve seen firsthand how overwhelming and upsetting incontinence can be. Patients visit me when things have gone too far – their behaviours change and they’re suddenly avoiding activities such as playing tennis, having sex or even going to the cinema because they’re worried about having to race to the toilet. When you start avoiding things you enjoy, it’s time to take action.Of course, leakage can be troubling at any moment, but during sex it’s particularly distressing (it tends to happen during an orgasm or because of the physical pressure). But the good news is, it doesn’t mean the end of your sex life. In fact, patients always say they wish they’d sought treatment sooner. Even if you don’t experience leakage, sexual sensation and satisfaction can be improved, too – and who wouldn’t want that? As well as increasing blood supply to the vagina and penis, pelvic floor muscle training (or “kegels”, as they’re also known), can improve muscle tone and maintain nerve activity, meaning better sex.When it comes to treatment for accidental leakage, it depends on the type of incontinence people are dealing with. “Stress incontinence” is when we suffer leakage while doing things such as sneezing, coughing or laughing, and it’s common for women to experience this after having a baby, when the pelvic floor is weakest. Leaking during sports or sex falls under this category, due to weakened pelvic floor muscles. The other common type is an overactive bladder, or “urge incontinence”, which feels like you have to urinate suddenly and often.Pelvic floor exercises can help in both instances, but it’s really important to make sure you’re doing them properly – speak to a women’s health physiotherapist or a continence specialist if unsure. They’re simple – just squeeze, lift and hold the anus and vagina, count to five and repeat five times. Improvement is fast – you’ll notice a change in six weeks if you do them regularly. There’s also a brilliant app called MyPFF, which reminds you to do your exercises.If an overactive bladder is the problem, lifestyle changes are key – symptoms can be worsened by too much caffeine, alcohol, fizzy drinks, spicy foods and stress, for example. Certain medications can also play a part, as well as conditions such as constipation, urinary tract infections and vaginal atrophy. Bladder retraining is great – when you have an urge to pee, you teach yourself to hang on, which slowly expands your bladder capacity. It might also be worth avoiding high-impact sports until your pelvic floor is stronger, since too much exercise can make things worse. Medication and surgery could be considered with a specialist, too.I definitely sense a change coming in the way we discuss women’s health issues and incontinence, and it’s great the conversation is becoming more open. There shouldn’t be any shame or stigma around it any more – this sort of condition affects so many of us. I hope people realise improvement is possible and that once the issue is tackled, it really can be life-changing. Recently, a woman visited me in my clinic and said that just having a treatment plan in place has made her feel better. It really is the very least we deserve.As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

It implies it’s a time of things “winding down”, “ending”, “drying up”.Well, most things. Because often, along with menopause, comes bladder weakness. And for many women that means that things get decidedly less dry.Unlike when a girl starts her period, which in many cultures is celebrated, and in the UK is now respected with a government campaign to provide sanitary products in schools, when a woman’s periods begin to end, it’s seen as a change towards old age, towards a body that’s “done”. And even for those going through menopause, it has often felt pretty taboo to talk about the daily problems – especially bladder weakness.“Don’t make me laugh, I’ll wet myself!” might seem like an age-old joke, but it’s one that’s true for menopausal women. And when it comes to our sex lives, it’s no laughing matter. There’s fear and shame and women shut down, choosing not to be intimate for fear of leaking urine during a passionate moment.After all, when do you slip “I’d love to have an early night but I’m worried I’ll wet the bed!” into the conversation, whether you’re with a long-term partner or someone new?The good news is this conversation is being reclaimed by women in the spotlight, who are starting to talk about the final menopause taboo of bladder weakness. Well, we talk so much about starting our periods – why would we not talk about stopping them, and how this affects your love life?It seems there has been a realisation that no matter whether you grace the red carpet and TV screens or you’re on the school run with grandchildren or off to the office, menopause will happen to every woman. Take Gwyneth Paltrow, for example, who released a video for her wellbeing site Goop, saying: “I think menopause gets a really bad rap, and needs a bit of rebranding.” Her video Madame Ovary spoke about mood swings and sweats, while British actress Emma Thompson has joked how hot sweats mean she’s not cold on the red carpet.OK, so the conversation is shifting – just like we can now see a tampon string in a TV ad (thanks to Sport England’s This Girl Can campaign), women are no longer sitting quietly while they deal with the side effects of menopause. But there is one subject that still has to work hard to find its way into our vocabulary – bladder weakness.We can talk hot flushes, night sweats, mood swings – all with increasing honesty. But then there’s Nadia Sawalha, who struggled with incontinence in silence. The usually outspoken TV presenter kept quiet about bladder weakness until she was forced to speak about it after having an accident on national TV.Why is it the one part of menopause women can’t talk about? Well, leaking during the day is one thing – the embarrassment of needing to find some alternative underwear, for example – but when it comes to sex, it’s a different matter altogether. Women who have bladder weakness and might have an accident during sex are likely to close off to their partner, so worried they’ll spoil the intimacy that they don’t have sex and even make up excuses, or “blame” menopause. Intimacy is not synonymous with leakage.After all, when you’re not sure whether you might lose control of your bladder, being intimate isn’t always top of the list. Talk about mixed messages! Women are encouraged to embrace their ageing, to love who they are and how they look – to go grey with glamour and grace, or to wear a bikini with pride. Just don’t mention the bladder weakness, right?!As periods end and change, we have to adjust. The problem is, the world doesn’t seem to adjust with us. And women are left in a strange quagmire of going through something so natural and even primal in silence and, often, shame.And with two-thirds of women over 40 affected with bladder weakness, and many revealing it has affected their mental health, it’s time we became more open and honest about how bladder weakness affects us.Meg Matthews, who has been campaigning about the menopause and runs megsmenopause, says: “Bladder weakness, also called bladder incontinence, is a very common consequence of menopause. It’s not easy to talk about this topic, and, because women don’t always feel confident talking about it, they can feel alone. We need to understand that having bladder weakness is OK. This is the message we need to spread.”But just like when we’re younger, confidence can come back when we use the right products. Once a girl knows she can use a tampon or pad, she’s less worried about her period affecting her day-to-day life. And for women with bladder issues, it’s about a pad that can help you forget there’s even a problem. Then you’ll feel freer to have those more difficult intimacy conversations that you’ve been putting off – and perhaps that early night …As incontinence affects one in three women over 35, we should all be having more open conversations about this everyday condition that impacts women of all ages.

Then the coronavirus happened For years, Mary P was employed by a major firm, cleaning its executive offices in Kansas City. Then, out of the blue a decade ago, the mother of three was told she was working for a different company.Mary P would carry on cleaning the same offices, but over time, while executives whose desks she was polishing continued to enjoy the fruits of their company’s fortunes, she saw her pay erode, healthcare coverage diminish, and what had seemed a secure job turn into an ad hoc position with few protections.Then coronavirus made its appearance.“They told me to go home. They would call me if they needed me. I won’t get paid. The health insurance only lasts until the end of the month,” said Mary P, who did not wish to be identified because she hopes to return to her job.Had coronavirus hit 15 years ago, she reckons she would have been in the same position as those whose offices she cleaned – at home, collecting salaries, reassured by good health coverage if they fall sick. But now she is cut adrift.“I can apply for food stamps and unemployment, but it won’t pay the rent. I’m really afraid of what happens if I get sick. I will just have to stay home. I can’t afford to pay for a doctor,” she said.As millions of Americans apply for unemployment benefits, the coronavirus pandemic has brutally laid bare the extent of US’s growing inequality, not only between the super rich and the rest of the country, but in the quality of jobs and the social protections that come with them.Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, said: “It has drawn into focus those disparities in a way that it’s not just about jobs, it’s not just about wages. It’s about health and working conditions and access to health insurance. All of these things highlight that there’s two different societies in this country. Because of rising inequality, more people are vulnerable.”The US is not alone in face a huge surge in unemployment because of the pandemic. But American workers are particularly vulnerable because they have neither the welfare safety nets afforded by France or Germany, nor the public healthcare of the UK and Canada. The rise of outsourcing, contract work and gig economy jobs has seen ever increasing numbers of workers exposed to sudden economic shock, whether because of a financial crisis or a pandemic.Coronavirus has also thrown a spotlight on the president’s claims of a strong economy when so many American workers lack the resources to cope with even a brief period without work. A Federal Reserve survey last year said four in 10 workers would struggle to find $400 in an emergency, with out-of-pocket medical expenses presenting a particular hardship.Pat “Duke” Dujakovich, the president of the Greater Kansas City AFL-CIO union confederation, said large numbers of his members were suddenly put out of work and now face an uncertain future with many of them losing their healthcare coverage in the middle of a national medical emergency.Dujakovich, who was a firefighter for 30 years, said he saw what was to come on a single day after a series of concerts and sporting events in Kansas City were called off because of coronavirus.“Everything got cancelled on a Wednesday. Thursday, the stage hands tore down what they had already set up, and that is the last time any of them worked anywhere in the region. They were the first ones to go and they’ve been out of work for quite a while.”To Gould, the crisis has been deepened by companies shedding responsibility.“Part of this is about employers not taking responsibility for people that should really be on their books, whether or not they’re gig workers, contract workers, self-employed workers. Those people are actually employees and they should be treated like employees,” she said.Many of those workers lost their health insurance at the time they might most need it, with bills for coronavirus treatment potentially running into the tens of thousands of dollars. Laid-off workers are eligible to continue their coverage under a government scheme called Cobra. But Dujakovich said many would not be able to afford it.“I’m still trying to figure out how someone who just lost their job manages to scrape together $800 or a $1,000 a month to maintain those Cobra benefits,” he said. There is no way I have found for a person who is unemployed on their own to try to get healthcare in America. It just doesn’t exist. And so the only way is through employment.”But even those who still have jobs are vulnerable to inadequate protections.Gould said more than a quarter of private-sector workers in the US cannot claim paid time off for sickness.. That, she said, puts large numbers of people on low pay at increased risk of Covid-19, because many of them have little choice but to go on working, even if they show symptoms, increasing the likelihood of the virus spreading.“This virus exposes a vast inequality between the professional sector, white-collar workers, who are able to weather this at home with much less risk, have paid sick days if they need to take it, have health insurance,” said Gould. “And then there is another class of workers that has far fewer protections. Those that are more likely to be exposed because of their jobs, more likely to get sick, more likely have adverse consequences from getting sick because of rising inequality, because they don’t have paid sick days or health insurance.”Many of those same workers are also more likely to contract Covid-19 because they have jobs that bring them into contact with the public such as transport workers, shop assistants and carers, highlighted by the death of Jason Hargrove, a Detroit bus driver.Two weeks ago, Hargrove posted a Facebook video venting his anger at a passenger who coughed in his face several times.“For you to get on the bus, and stand on the bus, and cough several times without covering up your mouth, and you know that we’re in the middle of a pandemic, that lets me know that some folks don’t care,” he said.The 50 year-old father of six contracted coronavirus and died 11 days later.Gould said this goes some way to explain why African American communities have been so badly hit. Many black workers have jobs that make it difficult to isolate while minority communities also endure higher levels of medical conditions – diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure – that make people more vulnerable to coronavirus. African American communities also have a harder time obtaining good healthcare.“Even if they’re OK to go to work, and they’re healthy and strong, they could still be bringing home that disease to elderly family members or to family members that are at higher risk with heart conditions, with their asthma or whatever it might be.” Dujakovich said that while those at the top are better able to insulate themselves from coronavirus, he told a told a meeting of national AFL-CIO leaders that they will not be able to avoid its consequences.“I said right now the bankers don’t give a fuck about working people, but they’re going to give a fuck about us very shortly. When we stop making car payments and house payments and rent and all of those things, because working people have to prioritise,” he said.“When the first pay cheque is missed and the second pay cheque is questionable and the third pay cheque is really questionable, then you have to kind of think of things as to what can kill me first. I need to feed my family this week.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6dee53ed3a9f5ab0dac3511d8dd5300f66faf65/0_0_1000_600/master/1000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6545e252bfa8f09bf05d37da87ef68ec","title":"coronavirus uk how many confirmed cases are in your area","story":"Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

Covid-19, the virus that had been detected on German soil for the first time two weeks earlier, was not among them.Yet the coronavirus is the single reason why the carnival session in Gangelt is now drawing close attention from scientists from around the world: seven people who walked out of the event later tested positive for the virus. A 47-year-old man who performed in the “male ballet” at the Gangelt carnival was the first person in Germany admitted to intensive care with the infection.Gangelt is in the Heinsberg district, which is home to 42,000 people and has since had 1,442 infections and 43 fatalities, more than any other administrative district in the country. The national media has started to refer to it as “Germany’s Wuhan”.A hundred days after a Chinese government website announced the discovery of a “pneumonia of unknown cause”, it has become clearer that the dynamics behind the virus’s rapid expansion across the globe has relied heavily on such “cluster effects”.Each of the countries most heavily hit by the pandemic has reported similar stories of social, cultural or religious gatherings where large numbers spent numerous hours in close company – holding hands, kissing, sharing drinks from the same glass – which then turbo-charged the spread of the pandemic.“One pattern we are seeing across the globe is that wherever there was singing and dancing, the virus spread more rapidly,” said Prof Hendrik Streeck, a virologist at the University of Bonn whose team of researchers has spent the last week carrying out the first “Covid-19 case cluster study” in Heinsberg.“Most infections didn’t take place in supermarkets or restaurants,” Streeck said of his preliminary findings. In Heinsberg, his team of coronavirus detectives could find scant evidence of the virus being transmitted via the surfaces of door handles, smart phones or other objects.Early theories that the virus at the carnival party in Gangelt could have been transmitted through the dishwater in the kitchen turned out to be a red herring: most guests drank their beer from bottles.Instead, he said, transmission took place at “events where people spent a length of time in each others’ close company”, such as apres ski parties in the Austrian resort of Ischgl, the Trompete nightclub in Berlin and a football match in northern Italy.“Mass events are a perfect opportunity for the virus, as people meet total strangers,” said Niki Popper, a mathematician at Vienna’s Technical University whose team has been developing a simulation that could help governments predict the development of the pandemic more accurately.Instead of merely multiplying the number of daily cases by a certain factor, Popper’s example tries to account for what he calls the starting point of “local epidemic networks”.“If you have 100 or 200 people spend enough time in a room with a person carrying the virus, then for example 20 might walk out with the new infection and, after a few days’ incubation time, pass it on to their families and workmates, let’s assume 10 more people each. Within a few days, the virus can thus multiply 200 times with only one new incident - and then continue.”Large parties played a key role in the pandemic’s rapid expansion not just in central Europe, but also in the US and Australia. New York may now be the centre of the US outbreak, but the traditional festivities around Mardi Gras is thought to have been a catalyst for a large outbreak in New Orleans.On 25 February the entire city, with almost 400,000 residents, and an estimated tourist crowd of 1.4 million people from all over the world were swallowed up in a tide of music, floats, extravagant costumes, cocktails and revelry for the climax of carnival.As is traditional in this Louisiana city on the Mississippi, gatherings and parades had begun weeks before, from 6 January onwards. Many people flung the doors of their houses open and crammed in friends, family, neighbours, strangers – all jostling, dancing, hugging, eating and drinking together.There were no social restrictions during carnival. Only weeks later, on 20 March did the mayor of New Orleans issue a stay-at-home order for the city, with Louisiana ordering statewide restrictions two days later, closing schools and all non-essential businesses. “Mardi Gras was the perfect storm, it provided the perfect conditions for the spread of this virus,” said Rebekah Gee, head of Louisiana State University’s healthcare services ision. For health authorities that were still trying to track and contain inidual infections at this stage of the pandemic, party clusters represented a particular challenge since revellers would often travel from and return to other regions, other countries or even other continents.In Australia, for example, at least 30 people including backpackers became infected after attending a crowded dance party at Bondi Beach’s Bucket List pavilion on 15 March. The party took place the night before restrictions came into force on gatherings of more than 500 people, during a weekend of mixed messages from the authorities. Australia’s prime minister was urging people not to gather in large numbers, but also saying he would go to a football game.Many of those who attended the “Back to Boogie Wonderland – Tropicana” event, which told people to release their “inner Caribbean dancer”, later retired to local backpacker hostels with dorm rooms and shared facilities.The Waverley council area, which encompasses Bondi and its backpacker community, has now become a hotspot for Covid-19, with many of its 140 cases linked to bars, clubs and restaurants, including the Bucket List.In many countries, partygoers and organisers have found themselves on the receiving end of a backlash. In Australia, the Bucket List’s Facebook page is full of livid comments condemning “idiots” who gathered to party. In Germany, cars with Heinsberg number plates have had their windows smashed and have been jeered as “corona spreaders”.But the novel coronavirus did not require social gatherings to have an overtly hedonistic character to flourish. In the week of 17 to 21 February, around 2,500 worshippers gathered at the Porte Ouverte Christian church in the Bourtzwiller district of Mulhouse, in Alsace, eastern France, for one of the most anticipated events in the evangelical calendar.They came from far and wide including from France’s overseas territories and Corsica, for a week of fasting and prayer – held annually for the last 25 years.“During the five days, the worshippers greeted each other, pecked each other on the cheeks, and held hands, sometimes while praying during the services,” Nathalie Schnoebelen, spokesperson for the church said afterwards.At the time, nobody thought more of it it would be almost a month before France went into a national lockdown. A small cluster of coronavirus cases had broken out in the unfortunately named Contamines ski resort in the Alps, but most coronavirus cases were still confined to China.“Contrary to what certain politicians have said, we didn’t ignore the basic rules because at the time there were not any,” Schnoebelen said.It was only after the congregation at the Porte Ouverte had dispersed and several worshippers tested positive for the coronavirus that concerns were raised. Among those who tested positive were the church’s main pastor, Samuel Peterschmitt (son of Jean Peterschmitt, who founded the Porte Ouverte church in 1966).In total 18 people from the Peterschmitt family tested positive for Covid-19. Samuel Peterschmitt’s son Jonathan admitted that worshippers had been in close confines for a week in “conditions relatively ideal if a virus wants to develop”.By the time it had been identified as a cradle for the virus, church worshippers had unwittingly passed it on to others. A nurse who had been at the Porte Ouverte is believed to have originated a cluster that contaminated 250 colleagues at Strasbourg University hospital, where she worked.Two retired worshippers returned to their home in the Ajaccio region of the Mediterranean island of Corsica. There are now at least 263 positive cases and 21 deaths on the island.A delegation of five church-goers from French Guiana, led by their evangelical pastor Gilles Sax, returned to the French overseas territory on the north-east coast of South America, on 25 February. Sax said he felt ill and was “trembling like a leaf” as soon as he returned..Other worshippers returned to cities and towns across France - Orléans, Besançon, Saint-Lô, Belfort, Dijon, Mâcon, Briançon, Paris. By 8 March, around 100 coronavirus cases had been linked to the church prayer week.Today, Mulhouse is one of the worst-hit areas in France with local hospitals overwhelmed by patients with the coronavirus.Christophe Lannelongue, until yesterday director general of the regional health authority, said: “It was a kind of atomic bomb that fell on us at the end of February and we didn’t notice it.”In Italy, which has recorded the highest number of deaths as a result of the virus, a Champions League football match between Atalanta and Spanish team Valencia on 19 February in Milan has been described as the “biological bomb” that turned the north of the country into the centre of the country’s outbreak.But scientists like Massimo Galli, the head of the infectious disease unit at the Sacco hospital in Milan, believe the spread is more likely to have accelerated in smaller clusters in the valleys around Bergamo.“We know Covid-19 is particularly efficient at transmitting within familial groups,” Galli told the . “In osterias crowded with elderly people, it would have found a perfect environment.”A similar gathering that brought together older and younger citizens preceded an outbreak of the virus in Italy’s south-east. On 3 March, hundreds of people gathered to pay their last respects at the funeral in San Marco in Lamis, a small city of 13,000. The 74-year-old man being buried had died after complications of what seemed to be a case of seasonal flu.Until that day, there had been seven cases of coronavirus infection in Puglia, the heel of Italy’s boot. The photos of patients in the red zones of northern Italy, and the first fatalities in Lombardy, seemed unimaginable, much like the national lockdown that was extended a few days later across the entire country.However, soon after the funeral, the man’s wife, who had just begun mourning the death of her husband, received a call informing her that her husband had tested positive for coronavirus.According to Ludovico Vaccaro, head of the public prosecutor’s office in Foggia, “a postmortem revealed the man was infected with Covid-19, but the result came out only after his body was released to the family for the funeral. They should have waited for the result of the test before handing over the man’s body.”Authorities said that, a few days earlier, the man had travelled to Cremona, in the north of Italy, to visit his daughter. Upon returning, he began to experience flu-like symptoms.According to doctors and investigators, the man had infected his daughter and wife before he died. At the funeral, they then came into contact with dozens of relatives and friends who gave their condolences to the family with handshakes and hugs, opening a gateway for one of the first clusters in southern Italy. As a result, 110 people were quarantined, dozens of whom tested positive for coronavirus. Two have died.The prosecutor’s office in Foggia has begun an investigation into what the governor of Puglia has called a “catastrophic error”. Behind one of the most dramatic cases of the virus’s spread is human error: if doctors had waited for the test results before handing over the body to family members, perhaps dozens of people could have avoided infection.Thinking of the coronavirus pandemic as a process that can speed up dramatically through human clusters also affects the considerations of policymakers who are plotting a route out of the current lockdown. When governments start to relax the current social distancing measures, can they also afford to allow large social, cultural or religious gatherings to go ahead?“The image of the Covid-19 epidemic as a curve has taken hold in the collective imagination, but my fear is that we are actually dealing with a loop,” said mathematician Popper. “As soon as restrictions are loosened, there could be new clusters that allow the spread to accelerate again.”The story of the pandemic in Vietnam serves as a cautionary tale.The south-east Asian country recorded its first cases of coronavirus on 23 January, a development that prompted swift action from officials. Vietnam kept many schools closed following the traditional lunar new year holiday late in January, and banned flights to and from China on 1 February. It also became the first country outside China to introduce a mass quarantine, when, on 12 February, officials isolated villages about 25 miles (40km) from Hanoi that were home to 10,000 people.Vietnam had detected no new cases for three weeks when a flight from London touched down at Hanoi’s Noi Bai international airport on 2 March. Among the hundreds of passengers onboard was a 27-year-old Vietnamese woman returning after a trip to attend exclusive fashion week events in Europe. Along with her sister, she had sat among guests at a Gucci show in Milan, and watched Yves Saint Laurent in Paris, documenting her travels on Instagram.The woman later told the New York Times that she had flown to Milan on 18 February and that, at the time, “no one was talking about the virus”. She travelled to Paris on 25 February, she added, and said she felt fine when she flew home that week.Days after arriving back in Vietnam, she developed a cough and tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the country’s “patient 17”. As of 7 April, Vietnam has 245 confirmed infections. The effort to trace and contain the virus has to start all over again.• This article was amended on 9 April 2020.

It is the second-highest daily total after Wednesday’s record 938 deaths.Despite the slightly lower figure, Vallance said the peak of the outbreak could still be weeks away. “I would expect the deaths to continue to keep going up for about two weeks after the intensive care picture improves. We’re not there yet, but that’s the sort of timeframe I would expect.”The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, pointed out that two weeks ago admissions to intensive care were doubling every three days. He said: “It’s now becoming not quite flat, but doubling time is now six or more days in almost every area in the country. That has only happened because of what everybody has done in terms of staying at home.”The official UK figure of 881 new deaths differs from the 891 total from figures released separately by agencies in the UK’s four countries, which gather their data differently. NHS England said a further 765 people had died, ranging in age from 24 to 103. Only 43 of those patients had no known underlying health condition.Scotland recorded 81 deaths, taking its total to 447. Unlike the rest of the UK, Scotland’s total includes some deaths outside hospitals because it counts all fatalities where Covid-19 is recorded as a cause on a death certificate.Wales recorded 41 deaths, taking its total to 286 and in Northern Ireland there were four more deaths, taking its total to 82.Last week the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said the NHS was preparing for at least 1,000 deaths a day, at a time when scientific advisers were forecasting the outbreak to peak at Easter.The peak was now expected to come in four weeks, after signs that the transmission rate was beginning to fall. New infections continue to fluctuate. On Thursday, 4,344 new cases were recorded, compared with 5,492 on Wednesday, but the day-on-day rise was still higher than three of the previous four days.He added: “If deaths are still following a rapid exponential growth, today’s new deaths would have been expected to be markedly higher than yesterday’s, and the total number of deaths to date would have doubled from that four days ago. Most, if not all, the deaths reported today will have come from infections before the so-called ‘hard lockdown’. It does seem that the hard lockdown is, as expected, reducing the rate of increase in the number of new hospital admissions.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/966b81ee4dfe1a92c87ab07a9dbb450df67631ae/0_783_5240_3145/master/5240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ef2928eb1ff4f9c798f0bdcd155e0ab","title":"awakening volcanic region reykjanes peninsula iceland disruption centuries","story":"Reykjanes peninsula’s last active period started in 10th century and lasted 300 yearsVolcanic activity is escalating in a region of Iceland that has not erupted for 800 years, with scientists warning it could cause disruption for centuries to come.Since 21 January, the Reykjanes peninsula south-west of Iceland’s capital, Reykjavik, has experienced more than 8,000 earthquakes and about 10cm of land uplift due to magma intrusions underground.“It seems that after being relatively inactive for many centuries, this region is waking up,” said Dave McGarvie, a volcanologist at Lancaster University. Situated close to the town of Grindavík and the popular Blue Lagoon tourist attraction, and only nine miles (15km) from Iceland’s international airport, the region last erupted about 800 years ago (though there have been more recent eruptions offshore). Geological evidence shows the area is fed by five volcanic systems, which seem to come to life in a coordinated way roughly every 1,000 years.The last period of volcanic activity on the peninsula began in the 10th century and continued until the 13th. Unlike typical Icelandic volcanoes, which tend to wake for a few years and then die down, when this region gets going it appears to splutter on and off for up to 300 years, producing eruptive episodes (locally known as “fires”) lasting a few decades. Long thin cracks known as fissures extend up to five miles (8km), producing fountains of lava, usually without large amounts of ash or explosive activity.The most recent “fires” occurred between 1210 and 1240 and covered about 50 sq km of land in lava. At least six separate eruptions occurred, each lasting weeks to months, interspersed with gaps of up to 12 years with no activity. Volcanic rock fragments and particles were carried tens of kilometres by the wind and written sources report the rockfall causing problems for livestock in the area.If a similar series of eruptions occurred today, the Iceland GeoSurvey calculates that runways at Keflavík airport could be coated in 2cm of ash, temporarily halting all flights.“Wind direction during times of ash production is critical – anything with a slight northerly aspect is going to cause problems for the international airport and the metropolitan area of Reykjavík,” said McGarvie.“The worst-case scenario is if lava flows towards the town of Grindavík,” said Kristín Jónsdóttir from the Icelandic Meteorological Office. “There is also other important infrastructure in the vicinity including a geothermal power plant. Hot and cold water supply may be at risk, along with roads, including the road between Reykjavík and Keflavík airport.”Icelanders are rarely fazed by volcanic activity, but they will be keeping a close eye on the Reykjanes peninsula. Because the eruptions are likely to be relatively small and occasional they will be easier to cope with than massive and sudden outpourings of lava like the 1783-84 Laki eruption, but if the pattern is indeed about to repeat, it will present a new kind of challenge for Icelanders.“People on the Reykjanes peninsula, and their descendants for several generations, may have to be on their guard and ready to evacuate every so often,” said McGarvie."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/554d67f612c9fcb5ad3ead4924749df48fbc33ef/0_159_2730_1639/master/2730.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=15ceb9e070023816b87e13fe0857fedf","title":"britons evacuated from wuhan regret coming home coronavirus","story":"Some who left Chinese city as coronavirus hit wish they were still there now lockdown has liftedLike many of the Britons who were evacuated from Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus pandemic, it was a difficult journey for Anthony May-Smith, involving a frantic last minute dash to the airport through the locked down city in January.All those repatriated from Wuhan underwent two weeks of quarantine in the Wirral, and after a brief stint of normality, May-Smith is now back in lockdown, wishing he had stayed put in China.“It’s just really weird, getting thrown back into it,” the 26-year-old from Lichfield said.He never imagined that the UK would end up in a lockdown: “It just makes you think, all the hassle that we went through to come back, was it really worth it?”He was in Wuhan visiting his girlfriend, Yenny, and had been offered a job teaching English there. Now he’s working as a truck driver and regularly sleeps in his vehicle to avoid the risk of infecting his grandparents at home.“Looking at it now, I wish I hadn’t come back,” he said. “I would be coming out of lockdown now, and instead I’m just going into one.”He’s not alone. Fellow evacuee Matt Raw, 38, is enjoying his life of lockdown in Knutsford, but said if he’d known how bad the outbreak was going to get in Britain, he would have stayed in China.“It feels a little bit like out of the pot, into the fire,” said Raw, who was living in Wuhan with his wife, Ying, and 75-year-old mother, Hazel, who suffers from dementia. “We made the wrong decision coming back here. We should have stayed in China.”He said the UK was “slow to act” and he was surprised the UK didn’t quarantine people flying into the country. “I just sat watching the news incredulously every single day. What was the point of putting us in quarantine?”He said he feels lucky to be living through lockdown in a spacious house with a garden, adding that his home in Wuhan was more cramped, and like many inner-city apartments in China, had little natural light.“We made our decision based on the best information available at the time. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.” he said. “Yes, I wish we’d stayed there. But by the same token, it’s also nice to be back over here again.”Jeff and Sindy Siddle, now in lockdown in Prudoe, Northumberland, also questioned whether leaving Wuhan had been the best course of action, but decided that – despite their nightmare journey – it was the best thing to do.“Overall I think we still made the right decision, but certainly we have asked the question,” said Jeff.The couple, along with their 10-year-old daughter, Jasmine, had been visiting Sindy’s family in a village in Hubei province, three hours drive from Wuhan, when the lockdown took effect.“Here, we can stay at home, we can do our jobs no problem,” said Sindy, an accounting assistant. “And Jasmine can do her school work. Back in Wuhan I was worried about her being the only one off school for a long time, but now all the kids are off, so I’m much more relaxed.”The one positive to come out of their Wuhan ordeal is their preparedness for the outbreak over here. “I think we are probably more cautious than a lot of the people in the UK because we’ve been through it before,” said Jeff.“We’ve been much more worried about it and we go out a lot less than our friends and family. We’re so worried we don’t go out beyond the garden, other than to the supermarket once a week, and we do click and collect to avoid going in.”The family originally faced being split apart, when Sindy was told she wouldn’t be allowed on the UK repatriation flight as she had a Chinese passport.Chris Hill, another Briton out in Wuhan, faced a similar problem after the Foreign Office was unable to confirm whether his wife and four-year-old daughter, both Chinese nationals, would be able to join him on the flight home.He decided to stay put.“I made the choice to stay because I didn’t want to risk leaving them,” said the 38-year-old from Sunderland, who has lived in Wuhan for 12 years and works as an English language teacher. “I did falter a couple of times and I would start having regrets. But I knew the lockdown wouldn’t last forever.After nearly 76 days stuck inside, and tight restrictions on movement still in place, he’s confident he was better off in China. “I’m still glad I made the decision to stay.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0246147ac890dff176b2a8b6b453f5394b1cd10a/0_220_6702_4021/master/6702.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3cb55b9bc94e694182a01a6ed93461a9","title":"chinese writer fang fang faces online backlash wuhan lockdown diary","story":"Internet users accuse Fang Fang of handing foreigners ‘a giant sword’ to attack ChinaA Chinese writer who published a diary during her time under lockdown in Wuhan has been subjected to widespread online criticism for publishing her book in English and German.Fang Fang has been accused of contributing to a negative international narrative on China’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic.The popular Wuhan writer began chronicling the lockdown in late January, including criticism of the official response.“How many people have died in Wuhan and their families destroyed?” she wrote on 31 January. “But so far not a single person has said sorry or taken responsibility. I’ve even seen a writer use the phrase ‘complete victory’. What are they talking about?”Her posts were shared widely on social media even as each was quickly deleted by censors, according to the Diplomat magazine.Her Weibo account, which had more than 3.8 million followers, was shut down in February.

Maybe she does not admit that she is unpatriotic, she thought we were extreme, in fact she was just a stupid old lady.”On Weibo, “Fang Fang Diary” has had 380m views, 94,000 discussions, and 8,210 original posts, peaking last week. On Twitter, the hashtag #wuhandiary shows hundreds of critical posts.“The attack on Fang Fang is so vehement and hateful that it’s scary to watch,” said Li Yuan, a New York Times columnist. “Fang Fang herself said that it reminded her of the Cultural Revolution.”On Wednesday, China’s English-language state newspaper said it was “shameful” to see Fang Fang praised in western media that had been dedicated to defaming China’s pandemic response.Citing “observers”, the editorial said her diary was “biased and only exposes the dark side in Wuhan while ignoring the efforts that local people made and the support extended across the nation”.Additional reporting by Pei Lin Wu"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4a879b5b777ed05ea4f1750756bf84b8bb9b5b9/256_0_3306_1984/master/3306.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=267d5b0ae0318b76cd59d5dbb4bf37e7","title":"coronavirus good news upside blessings covid positive","story":"Though our blessings may be well disguised in this pandemic, we must still count them“Everything bad in life is eventually a blessing.”I’m not sure where I read this – it may well have been in this wonderful novel by Taffy Brodesser-Akner.

Its earliest findings suggest younger children (aged four to 10) are more worried than those in the 11-16 age group. According to parents’ perceptions, their older children are significantly less worried, though researchers point out it can be hard for parents to know what their adolescent children are feeling, in contrast with younger children who may express their fears more openly to their parents.“But one of the things we can see here is that the majority of children are not worrying excessively about it, but seem to be taking it in their stride. There are, however, a significant sub-group who are reporting high levels of worry.”“Research has provided valuable information about how parents and carers can support their children’s mental health in general,” said Creswell. “However, at this point, we know very little about what might be most effective in the current context of Covid-19. We hope to have more than 10,000 parents and carers across the UK complete the new online survey. Their responses will help us really understand how families are coping and what support could make all the difference to children, young people and their families at this time.”Wendy Minhinnett, who leads a support group for parents of young people who struggle with mental health difficulties, said many parents were struggling in the coronavirus crisis. “People are feeling really, really isolated and alone. When you are supporting a child with mental health issues, that puts extra pressure on you.”She said families where grandparents normally played a key role but no longer could because of the lockdown had been severely affected, as had families with children diagnosed with autism whose routines had been entirely disrupted.“One parent said, ‘My son will not let me go anywhere because he is so frightened of me catching something’. People are really, really anxious about it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f03da2c34da2dfc9dcf49a3dd210d462a45225b/0_140_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc4c0dc2889b0a62c50053ee1e301a92","title":"leap of faith ancient britons viewed hares chickens as gods easter","story":"Iron age research reveals modern Easter festivals not first to celebrate chicks and bunniesBrown hares and chickens were revered as gods rather than reared for food when they were first introduced to Britain in the iron age, archaeological analysis suggests.In research that shows modern-day Easter festivals were not the first to celebrate chicks and bunnies, a team of experts from the universities of Exeter, Leicester and Oxford have found evidence that the animals were buried with care and intact in the period that preceded the Roman invasion of Britain.Historical evidence suggests Britons of the period associated the animals with deities and considered them too special to eat. Commentarii de Bello Gallico, Julius Caesar’s firsthand account of the Gallic wars, says “the Britons consider it contrary to ine law to eat the hare, the chicken or the goose. They raise these, however, for their own amusement or pleasure.”Radiocarbon analysis of hare and chicken skeletons from a number of sites in Hampshire and Herefordshire backs up that assertion, showing that the two species were introduced simultaneously to Britain between the fifth and third centuries BC. Excavation has previously revealed the animals had been carefully buried without being butchered.Prof Naomi Sykes from the University of Exeter, who is leading the research, said: ““Easter is an important British festival, yet none of its iconic elements are native to Britain. The idea that chickens and hares initially had religious associations is not surprising as cross-cultural studies have shown that exotic things and animals are often given supernatural status.“Historical accounts have suggested chickens and hares were too special to be eaten and were instead associated with deities – chickens with an iron age god akin to Roman Mercury, and hares with an unknown female hare goddess. The religious association of hares and chickens endured throughout the Roman period.“However, archaeological evidence shows that as their populations increased, they were increasingly eaten, and hares were even farmed as livestock. Rather than being buried as iniduals, hare and chicken remains were then disposed of as food waste.”The cross-disciplinary academic team, whose objective is to investigate the origins of Easter traditions and the animals that have come to be associated with it, has previously revealed that the first rabbits were introduced to Britain not by the Normans, as was previously thought, but by the Romans, who arrived in the first century AD.Hares and chickens were both farmed for food during the Roman occupation of Britain, but in the economic collapse following the Roman withdrawal in 410AD rabbits became locally extinct and the populations of chickens and brown hares crashed.Historical and archaeological evidence show rabbits were reintroduced to Britain as an elite food by the Normans in the 11th century. Rabbits were increasingly common in the 19th century, probably contributing to their replacement of the hare as the Easter bunny when the festival’s traditions were reinvigorated by the Victorians."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a73d6da193cefdbbc3532068aa6acda3e87b0f7/0_105_3756_2254/master/3756.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e5a770e663d599118e36864245be313","title":"less than 1 of austria infected with coronavirus new study shows","story":"Research appears to scotch hopes of countries being close to relying on ‘herd immunity’The government-commissioned study, reportedly the first of its kind in continental Europe, was led by the polling company Sora, which is known for projecting election results, in cooperation with the Red Cross, the Medical University of Vienna, and other institutions.The study made it possible to estimate the prevalence of acute coronavirus infections in Austria among those not in hospital at the beginning of April, and was designed to provide a clearer picture of the total number of infections, given gaps in testing.The research, if replicated and confirmed elsewhere, would appear to scotch hopes of countries being remotely close to relying on “herd immunity” – where enough of the population is exposed to the virus to build up a combined immunity – as a viable policy option.The study stands in contrast to controversial modelling by researchers at Oxford University who, in one scenario they examined, suggested most people in the UK might already have been infected with Covid-19. Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:audio.guim20200408-57750-gnl.sci.20200409.ms.covid_19_lockdown.mp3 However, researchers, speaking at a press conference to release the results, said the study provided only a “snapshot” and did not account for asymptomatic infections, or people who were immune.“We did not find out how many people are immune, but only how many people in Austria are currently acutely infected,” said Günther Ogris, from Sora.The issue of the proportion of asymptomatic infections in the population remains highly contested, with a World Health Organization report in February suggesting truly asymptomatic cases were relatively rare. However, another small Chinese study, reported in the British Medical Journal earlier this month, posited that up to four-fifths of all infections could be without symptoms.Ogris said Sora had “defined the population as all people living in Austria”, and added that the youngest test subject was not yet a year old, and the oldest was aged 94.Commenting on the result, the science minister, Heinz Fassmann, said it indicated a low rate of immunity, which meant that without controls there was a continued risk of an exponential growth in infections.“The mountain is higher than expected and we are not yet on the safe side,” he said.Austria’s current policy is to test people with symptoms, especially if they have been to a known hotspot or in close contact with an infected inidual. That means many people, such as those with no symptoms, or no known contact to an at-risk area, go undetected.The country reacted early to the outbreak, closing schools, restaurants, theatres and other gathering places more than three weeks ago, and telling people to stay home.Hospital admissions have stabilised, with the daily percentage increase in infections in low single digits. There have been 319 deaths and 13,337 confirmed cases, of which about 7,000 people are still infected. The study estimated the current number of infections was more than four times that, however, at around 28,500 people. It excluded those in hospital, currently about 1,000 people.The study, conducted from 1-6 April, tested 1,554 people. It did not involve antibody tests, which can tell whether a person was previously infected and is therefore probably immune. Future studies should involve antibody tests, the government has said, to inform policy as the country starts to reopen shops from 14 April.The education minister, Heinz Fassmann, whose portfolio includes research, said: “We must monitor whether there is a second wave and the number of infected people starts to rise again. We are still in a very, very sensitive situation. This study shows that, too. Corona is in our society.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/48b0f66b158280333567af408302a7db7fcd3b15/0_7_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e0833b5b2080b3acfe2e9dd8b76a287","title":"lisa nandy seeks urgent meeting with dominic raab over covid 19 repatriations","story":"Shadow foreign secretary wants to know why thousands remain stranded a fortnight after £75m rescue mission was announcedThe shadow foreign secretary, Lisa Nandy, is demanding an immediate meeting with Dominic Raab as thousands of British nationals remain stranded abroad two weeks after he unveiled his £75m coronavirus rescue mission.Her office have let the foreign secretary know they are seeking a meeting with him “as an absolute matter of urgency”, said a spokesman after a conference call with 70 MPs and staff to discuss the continuing repatriation crisis.MPs expressed concern about Britons stranded in India, Pakistan, Australia and New Zealand, which closed its borders two weeks ago.They also expressed frustration that 11 new rescue flights were being laid on for India while none were being planned for Pakistan, where it emerged there could be as many as 20,000 stranded Britons.During the call there were also complaints that the Foreign Office was fobbing off politicians who were making representations about their constituents with stock emails and an “auto-response” saying emails were not being monitored.Their concerns emerged as insiders complained that the crisis response seemed to involve a “head of correspondence” rather than a “head of crisis” in relation to repatriation flights.Planes organised by the government have already been organised for Peru, Ghana, Algeria, India, Nepal and South Africa, with Ecuador and Bolivia also on the list. There have also been calls for charter flights to be laid on to Argentina.A retired GP, Adrienne Newton, who has been stranded for weeks in Córdoba, 700km (435 miles) from Buenos Aires, said the embassy, had sent details at 1am on the day of a potential Air France flight from Buenos Aires.After protesting on Twitter that there were no connections to the capital because of the lockdown, the embassy tweeted details of a transport company “that has worked with other embassies, good luck!”, she said.“If other countries are contracting companies to transport its nationals to airports for flights home, why isn’t ours? Clearly it’s not a logistical issue. The flight yesterday with KLM left Buenos Aires half empty. I am starting to think this is not just a question of inefficiency,” she added.Meanwhile, the Foreign Office says that as long as the Pakistani government allows the national airline, PIA, to continue repatriation flights to London, there is no need to charter flights.It says it has already repatriated 4,000 of 6,000 people stranded in that country and was confident it could get thousands more home on PIA flights.However, in a conference call between the government’s South Asia minister, Lord Ahmad, the UK high commissioner in Pakistan and 10 MPs with large numbers of constituents stranded, it emerged there could be tens of thousands of Britons stuck in the country.Sam Tarry, the Labour MP for South Ilford, who was on the call, said: “I know the British high commission has been working very hard on this. They said that there’s going to be a series of more flights. They’re saying there are up to 20,000 people who want to come home.”He added that MPs on the call raised the issue of the “lack of faith” in PIA to deliver further flights after constituents paid out thousands of pounds for tickets on flights that were cancelled. But he was told that charter flights would be difficult. “They felt the issues were going to be that the Pakistan government were not going to open the international airspace to obviously allow charter flights to take place. So they were saying essentially the only option is PIA.”Afzal Khan, the shadow deputy leader of the House of Commons, said that British nationals in Pakistan were “still having to pay for the chaotic mismanagement of PIA and the British repatriation effort”, in a letter to Raab.The Foreign Office has been approached for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/98bbaab570b58f94bf8e5a94d8760c38f49c5f76/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bfdf2d62ab34591125c4ac863de2760","title":"mafia distributes food to italys struggling residents","story":"Organised crime groups offer support to quarantined families who have run out of cashAs Italy struggles to pull its economy through the coronavirus crisis, the Mafia is gaining local support by distributing free food to poor families in quarantine who have run out of cash, authorities have warned.In recent weeks, videos have surfaced of known Mafia gangs delivering essential goods to Italians hit hard by the coronavirus emergency across the poorest southern regions of Campania, Calabria, Sicily and Puglia, as tensions rise across the country.“For over a month, shops, cafés, restaurants and pubs have been closed,” Nicola Gratteri, antimafia investigator and head of the prosecutor’s office in Catanzaro, told the . “Millions of people work in the grey economy, which means that they haven’t received any income in more than a month and have no idea when they might return to work. The government is issuing so-called shopping vouchers to support people. If the state doesn’t step in soon to help these families, the mafia will provide its services, imposing their control over people’s lives.”The ramifications of the lockdown in Italy are affecting the estimated 3.3 million people in Italy who work off the books. Of those, more than 1 million live in the south, according to the most recent figures from CGIA Mestre, a Venice-based small business association. There have been reports of small shop owners being pressured to give food for free, while police are patrolling supermarkets in some areas to stop thefts. Videos of people in Sicily protesting against the government’s stalled response, or people beating their fists outside banks in Bari for a €50 (£44) loan are going viral and throwing fuel on the crisis a fire the mafia is more than willing to stoke.From the first signals of mounting social unrest, the Italian minister of the interior, Luciana Lamorgese, said ‘‘the mafia could take advantage of the rising poverty, swooping in to recruit people to its organisation’’. Or simply stepping in to distribute free food parcels of pasta, water, flour and milk.In recent days, the police in Naples have intensified their presence in the poorest quarters of the city, where men tied to the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia, have organised home delivery of food parcels. Magistrates have already begun an investigation against a group of people who were questioned while distributing food to local residents.In Palermo, according to La Repubblica, the brother of a Cosa Nostra boss allegedly distributed food to the poor in the Zen neighbourhood, an area with an established mafia presence. When the news broke, the man defended himself on Facebook, claiming that he was only doing charitable work and attacking the journalist who first reported the news.“Mafias are not just criminal organisations,’’ Federico Varese, professor of criminology at the University of Oxford, said. “They are organisations that aspire to govern territories and markets. Commentators often focus on the financial aspect of mafias but they tend to forget that their strength comes from having a local base from which to operate.”The question of distributing food parcels is a tactic as old as the mafia itself, where in the south of Italy bosses have customarily presented themselves to the people as benefactors and local power brokers, initially without asking for anything in return.“Mafia bosses consider their cities as their own fiefdom,” Gratteri said. “The bosses know very well that in order to govern, they need to take care of the people in their territory. And they do it by exploiting the situation to their advantage. In the people’s eyes, a boss who knocks on the door offering free food is a hero. And the boss knows that he can then count on the support of these families when necessary, when, for example, the mafia sponsors a politician for election who will further their criminal interests.”Dozens of investigations in the south have led to the arrests of politicians who have aided and abetted the mafia, and who were elected with the support of local Mafiosi who forced citizens to vote for them in exchange for services, such as a simple food parcel.Varese said: “These handouts by the mafias are not gifts. The mafia does not do anything out of its kind heart. They are favours that everyone will have to pay back in some form or another, by aiding and abetting a fugitive, holding a gun, dealing drugs and the like.”“Consider what happened to El Chapo, the Mexican narco,” said Gratteri. “He trafficked tons of cocaine and commissioned the murder of hundreds of people but in his hometown he was known for his benevolence, because people said that he provided medicines to families or built roads. The same thing happens here.”This week, Itay’s antimafia prosecutor’s office said bosses would offer their virtually endless criminal capital to businesses in need, and then swallow them up. Then, they will use those businesses for money laundering profits from the criminal activities.Varese said: “The mafias might be able to benefit in other ways from the current lockdown and especially from the future, when Italians will all be able to return to work, spend more money, and get the economy on its feet again. But surely the story exemplified by the handouts of food parcels in Palermo and Naples shows their true nature, and it tells why they are so dangerous.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/37f49628e3071361a7028e1ca26a26087cd30107/0_21_2144_1286/master/2144.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca29798b78a0faec80f9f6ae530271ac","title":"newsround cbbc kids tv is responding to the coronavirus","story":"Shows such as CBBC’s Newsround are trying to alleviate anxieties children have about the pandemicChildren’s TV and radio presenters are finding new ways to stop their audiences feeling stressed, following reports that young children are become increasingly anxious about the coronavirus pandemic.The BBC’s long-running Newsround programme has seen its audience rise substantially for its three daily broadcasts on the CBBC channel and its dedicated website, with its reporters trying to find ways to provide optimistic takes on the news without sugarcoating the situation.“So many kids now have anxiety issues,” said Ricky Boleto, a presenter on the programme. “We’re letting kids know that we focus on what’s happening in their homes and gardens without making them feel they have to sort out the world’s problems … They’re sending questions such as ‘Is my grandmother going to die’? We’ve been trying to put them at ease.”He said children “have a very good moral compass, probably better than most adults” and Newsround aims to cover stories without patronising audiences: “The most important thing for us is to tell stories in a way that doesn’t presume knowledge, doesn’t patronise, and makes young people feel that this is their programme.”The programme has seen an increased emphasis on asking children to submit their own material on how they are dealing with the lockdown while schools are closed: “There’s scary headlines elsewhere but Newsround is a safe space for kids to turn to while coronavirus changes everything about our lives. We try to be a positive platform as well and focus on what good is being done.”Other changes are having to be made to children’s output. Amid the ongoing travel restrictions, the CBBC broom cupboard – the location where presenters introduce the next programme on the kids’ channel – has been transferred to presenters’ homes for the first time in 44 years. The BBC is also preparing to launch an enormous range of educational programmes from 20 April onwards.Matt Deegan, who runs the independent national children’s radio station Fun Kids, said he has had to change the station’s output to reflect the new reality: “Our presenters refer to the fact that they’re broadcasting from home and talk about the positives and sometimes the negatives.”He has also launched a daily children’s podcast called Stuck at Home, which has suggestions like using what’s in the recycling bin as as source for collages or creating Zoom quizzes for other family members. It has also become the first piece of content from a commercial radio station to be made available on BBC Sounds.Deegan said young children pick up on the severity of the situation: “I think there’s an awareness by them that parents think it’s serious and their sporadic anxiousness often gets eye rolls. The sheer volume of news drives parents to discuss things more openly than perhaps they normally would.”Boleto, the Newsround host, said explaining the news in simple terms for children was a real challenge: “Nick Robinson and Evan Davis have said that writing scripts for Newsround is harder than their day jobs. You have to go from the start, not presume any knowledge, and tell the story.”However, there is still space for some lightness on the show amid the pandemic gloom. He said: “We do still throw in the odd skateboarding dog and panda birth.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3640c2cb134a1236e456d2136a5a5d0d0621148e/0_240_6454_3873/master/6454.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=acb89a2f7e1d245d6387b18cdca32183","title":"tech giants struggle stem infodemic false coronavirus claims","story":"Critics say efforts are too little, too late as research reveals vast majority of false claims appear onlineClick over to Google, type in “coronavirus”, and press enter.The results you see will bear little resemblance to any other search.There are no ads, no product recommendations, and no links to websites that have figured out how to win the search engine optimisation game. Government, NGO and mainstream media sources dominate.Algorithms and user-generated content are out gatekeepers and fact checking are in.Silicon Valley has responded to the “infodemic” with aggressive intervention and an embrace of official sources and traditional media outlets.Across the social web – on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Reddit, Instagram and Pinterest – search results related to Covid-19 are similarly predetermined.Instagram delivers a pop-up urging US users to go to the website for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) – or UK users to the NHS – rather than look at the memes and pictures tagged with #coronavirus.On Facebook, a dedicated “Information Center” includes a mix of curated information and official medical advice. On Pinterest, the only infographics and memes to be found on topics such as “Covid-19” or “hydroxychloroquine” are those made by internationally recognised health organisations, such as the WHO.It is a stark contrast to how social media platforms have dealt with misinformation in the past.US-based platforms, shaped by Silicon Valley’s libertarian ethos and protected by the first amendment, have long been reluctant to take a proactive editorial role or censor speech that could be considered political.They have had to be pushed, prodded, cajoled, protested, and shamed into addressing hate speech, anti-vaxx propaganda and the harassment of victims of mass shootings.On coronavirus, they have competed to be responsible and reliable sources of information. Yet still misinformation continues to adapt and spread, largely on social media.A conspiracy theory falsely linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic has led to real-world consequences, including threats and harassment against telecom engineers and petrol bomb attacks on telephone poles.Carl Bergstrom, a University of Washington professor of biology who also studies and has written a book about misinformation, says the efforts of the social media companies are too little, too late.“They’ve built this whole ecosystem that is all about engagement, allows viral spread, and hasn’t ever put any currency on accuracy,” he said. “Now all of a sudden we have a serious global crisis, and they want to put some Band-Aids on it. It’s better than not acting, but praising them for doing it is like praising Philip Morris for putting filters on cigarettes.”Some of the more radical steps taken by tech companies include Twitter’s new policy to remove misinformation that contradicts official public health advice, such as tweets encouraging people not to follow physical distancing guidelines, and WhatsApp’s strict new limits on message forwarding.The platforms feel they can be much more aggressive on coronavirus misinformation than they have been on political misinformation, said Claire Wardle of the non-profit organisation First Draft.“There are no two sides with coronavirus, so they don’t have people on the other side saying: ‘We want this,’ the way you do with anti-vaxxers or political misinformation,” said Wardle. “They are freer to act.”It is also relatively simple and straightforward for the platforms to select trusted sources of authoritative information – the WHO, NHS, CDC, etc – without appearing politically biased.Wardle faulted the tech companies for not being better prepared for the crisis, however. Facebook has long ignored the conspiracy communities that organise using Facebook groups, such as anti-vaxxers, followers of QAnon, and people who believe 5G is harmful. Coronavirus misinformation is rampant in those communities.And while the scientific nature of the crisis may lessen some of the external political pressures over how to moderate speech, it also brings with it a slew of challenges. The coronavirus is brand new, and the scientific understanding of it changes daily.Bergstrom described this conundrum as an “uncertainty vacuum”. “Any reasonable authority will not give you a straight answer” to certain questions about the pandemic, “not because they’re trying to mislead you, but because they don’t know yet,” he said. Another complicating factor is that normally trustworthy sources are not providing reliable information.“We’ve seen the US government, particularly the White House, becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus,” Bergstrom said.Facebook and Twitter have removed posts by prominent and powerful people over coronavirus misinformation, including the Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, but the real test of their resolve will be whether they ever take action against misinformation by Trump.“We planned for years for this pandemic, but we never realised that we would be fighting a war on two fronts,” said Bergstrom. “One against the pandemic, and one against all the disinformation and hate and fear that is being amped up and enflamed by political opportunists.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9919b7cbd6ec8912115d8c3fea9bc4c8d3fa4be5/0_6_1570_942/master/1570.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8308ead4e4a1fe0ffa3766cb9200c4da","title":"uk churches live stream easter services during lockdown","story":"Archbishop of Canterbury among those who will broadcast to worshippers onlineChurches and cathedrals across the UK are preparing to hold Easter services online as Christians face the most important festival of their year under lockdown.The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will lead a service on Sunday broadcast from an iPad in his kitchen. Usually he preaches to 1,500 worshippers in Canterbury Cathedral.Welby will say: “After so much suffering, so much heroism from key workers and the NHS, we cannot be content to go back to what was before as if all is normal. There needs to be a resurrection of our common life.”He will acknowledge that “many people right across the country are anxious about employment, food, are isolated from loved ones and feel that the future looks dark. People right across the globe feel the same uncertainty, fear, despair and isolation. But you are not alone.”Welby’s wife, Caroline, will read a lesson, and they will be joined online by Rose Hudson-Wilkin, the bishop of Dover, and 10-year-old Theodore Levings, who will lead prayers.The service will be broadcast live on BBC Radio 4 and streamed on the Church of England’s Facebook page and website from 9am.Acts of worship have been streamed from clergy homes since the Church of England closed all its churches, even to priests and for private prayer, as part of the coronavirus lockdown.According to the C of E, more than 2 million people have tuned in to national streamed services, and additional large audiences have watched more than 3,000 services streamed from local churches.The Church of Scotland is streaming a service led by its moderator, the Right Rev Colin Sinclair, on Easter Sunday morning and is inviting people to join a prayer at 7pm, in both English and Gaelic, broadcast on its website. Local churches will be holding acts of worship online.The Catholic church in England and Wales has also reported high numbers of people joining online services. Sunday mass at Plymouth Cathedral usually attracts up to 650 worshippers, but 2,200 people tuned in for last week’s Palm Sunday service. Those joining weekday online masses have doubled to 700 on some days. Weekly evening prayer, usually attended by about a dozen worshippers, is attracting between 200 and 400 people.Mark O’Toole, the Catholic bishop of Plymouth, said: “This period of isolation has given us the confidence to embrace new platforms to communicate God’s message of love and hope. This is sorely needed at this time.”Anglican cathedrals are finding creative ways to celebrate Holy Week. At Bristol, nearly 40 choristers have joined a special “quirentine” multi-track performance of This Joyful Eastertide, recorded in isolation from one another.Lincoln Cathedral has been illuminated in purple and white – and blue in support of the NHS on Thursday – before turning dark for Good Friday when the church enters a period of mourning. It will be lit in gold on Easter Sunday to celebrate the resurrection.Salisbury Cathedral has created a virtual Holy Week pilgrimage. Those wishing to pray or reflect can activate a different window of music, reading and prayer each day.Passion plays, depicting the crucifixion of Jesus, which were due to be performed in at least 10 locations across the UK, involving thousands of amateur performers, have been cancelled. Last year, more than 20,000 people watched The Passion of Jesus in Trafalgar Square in London.Prerecorded reflections from faith leaders, rehearsal clips and interviews will instead be streamed on Friday, along with a screening of the 2019 Trafalgar Square performance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5f62b64ffe5550738eeb72485c039400a35c26c/0_92_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=668e778840bb4ee1d25df1dd462ccf13","title":"uk curator criticises misleading reports about looted items","story":"British Museum’s St John Simpson denies Europe is flooded with recently stolen artefactsReporting of the illegal trade in antiquities from Iraq and Syria is leading to a false impression that the European market is flooded with looted items, according to a British Museum curator.“There’s a very strong tendency to say that all objects without provenance are the produce of recent looting,” he said. “But some objects have been circulating for decades, if not longer. It’s a case of assessing each item on its own merits.”Simpson said that in his role as an advisor for UK law enforcement on items that have been seized on exit or entry into the country, there has yet to be a proven case of a recently looted item from Syria being discovered in Britain.He said: “I think the really telling statistic is that over the last eight years of the Syrian civil war we have yet to prove any objects have come into Britain that demonstrably come from looting in Syria,” he said. “We are investigating cases at the moment but that is a remarkable figure.”In March, a UN-backed report stated Germany had become an international destination for trafficking illegal antiquities from the Eastern Mediterranean, including Iraq and Syria, with almost half of the 6,000 examined items coming from the two countries.Markus Hilgert, general secretary of the German Federal Cultural Foundation, said the report’s findings were shocking, especially in light of EU trade restrictions in place for both Iraq and Syria. “In view of the ongoing, extensive destruction and looting of archeological cultural assets in Iraq and Syria, this is an alarming finding,” Hilgert added.Simpson said in Syria there had been “ad-hoc and opportunistic looting” but the picture painted by the German Federal Cultural Foundation’s study was down to “rather simplistic” reporting. “Put it this way,” he said. “I would like see every one of those objects personally to be confident that they are from recent looting rather than older items or fakes.”The curator said the situation in the UK is completely different from the 1990s when large numbers of looted Iraqi items were sold. He called for “caution and curatorial intelligence” to be used when deciding when and where items originated. “Some of these objects floating around on the western market could actually come not from recent looting, they’re probably coming from 1990s or 2003 looting,” he added.The British Museum recently launched the Circulating Artefacts project, to “counteract looting and trafficking of cultural artefacts”. It created a database of objects designed to help curb the trade in illicit objects from Sudan and Egypt.But it has also been criticised for items in its collection that were acquired by looting, such as the Benin Bronzes, which were taken in a “punitive expedition” led by British troops in 1897.Senegalese academic Felwine Sarr co-authored a report that recommended a restitution programme to transfer hundreds of items from European institutions to Africa. He criticised the British Museum for acting like “an ostrich with its head in the sand” after not addressing calls for items acquired by colonial-era looting to be returned.In response, a spokesperson for the British Museum said it welcomed a “transparent focus on the provenance of objects”, adding that the museum agreed with the report’s call for the establishment of “new and more equitable relationships between Europe and Africa”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3d3cfbda2a7a0fcb476054adbb4d9c2af05872ec/0_5_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8e47c6f0eb4865ff1b3d69ff20dcaac","title":"how are you affected by coronavirus in the south west of the uk","story":"If you live in the south-west England or Wales, we’d like to find out about the impact of coronavirus on you and your community.

But the UK and the US have so far seemed to be about two weeks behind Italy in the progress of the disease, so their worst days may well be yet to come. Similarly, although the Chinese city of Wuhan is gradually reopening after two months of lockdown, it is by no means clear when or how other countries will begin to return to normal. In the meantime, scientists are working on several fronts to develop treatments and possibly vaccines some of those trials may start to show results in the next month or so, but a viable vaccine could still be 18 months away.Data caveatsThe case counts come from data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, one of the most reliable sources.

All around us were jagged, brilliant white peaks, piercing blue glaciers and water flecked with such a constellation of ice fragments that you could imagine a sky-sized mirror had shattered on to the surface of the ocean.The pilot cut the outboard engine to reduce noise while the scientist, Tim Lewis, dropped the hydrophone – essentially a waterproof microphone on a long cable – into the ocean. We sat quietly as the boat bobbed and drifted to within a few metres of an iceberg the size of a church. Dozens of gentoo penguins swished in and out of the water. Further off, we could hear the intermittent rumbles of avalanches as mountain snow warmed and collapsed in the pale southern summer sun. But it was the underwater soundscape that we had come to hear. After playing out 20 metres of cable, Lewis took off his woolly hat, put on the headphones, closed his eyes and let his ears take him down to the depths. We watched his face for clues as to what he was hearing. First a frown. (Is the equipment working properly?) Then a look of bemusement. Finally a wry smile. “I have never heard anything like it. Not what I expected at all,” he said. “It sounds like dripping, like the inside of a gorge.”The earphones were passed from person to person. Everyone listened with a similar expression of concentration and offered their own interpretation of these strange sounds. “Drips in a drain,” said one of the activists. “Forest waterfall,” said the coxswain. “Rainfall on city streets,” said the camera operator.My turn came, and I, too, was transported. Not, it seemed, below the ocean, but into a vast cavern, where it sounded as if water was cascading from a high ceiling, each drip echoing through the emptiness.  Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:uploads.guim20200408melting-glacier--trimmed.mp3 “That’s the sound of the iceberg melting,” Lewis informed us. When snow falls, he explained, pockets of air get trapped and then compressed inside glaciers over years, centuries, even millennia. “What you can hear are the pops as they are released,” he said. It was the opposite of what we imagined. Rather than water dripping down through air, we were listening to air escaping up through water. We were so close to the ice that this ancient fizz was surprisingly loud. Though we humans never hear it above the surface, this is the sound the Antarctic makes every summer. And as the planet heats, the sound is getting louder.It was mid-January, the peak of the Antarctic summer, and I had joined a broader 10-month, pole-to-pole expedition by scientists and campaigners on two Greenpeace ships, the Arctic Sunrise and the Esperanza. On this final leg around the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands, nine researchers from British, French and US universities were measuring how human activity is disturbing the region’s natural equilibrium.With the help of 59 crew members – a mix of sailors, engineers and activists – the scientists conducted acoustic monitoring, environmental DNA sampling, testing for plastic microfibres, phytoplankton analysis, as well as surveys of penguin and whale populations. Just as the first explorers once charted coastlines voyage by voyage, the aim was to map Antarctic ecosystems. Many of the waters and islands we were visiting had not been surveyed for decades, if ever. I caught up with the Sunrise at King George’s Island, about 600 miles south of Cape Horn, the southern tip of South America. Home to an airfield, two churches, the research bases of 10 countries and about 500 semi-permanent residents, this international community has often been cast as the last hope of humanity in dystopian novels and films because of its remoteness, collaborative spirit and focus on science. (Today, coincidentally, Antarctica is the only continent that does not have a single case of coronavirus).But it is all too vulnerable to the other great global crisis – climate change. Veterans of Antarctic exploration had warned me that this location would give me my first taste of how rapidly the region is warming. On the slopes around the bay, there was more bare rock than snow, while the stony beach was so free of ice that it could almost have been Brighton, were it not for the penguins. This was to be expected. Temperatures on the peninsula – the finger of land that points up from Antarctica towards South America – have risen by about 3C in the past 70 years, one of the fastest increases in the world. What was more surprising was the number of other vessels bobbing in the bay.“People think Antarctica is isolated. That is a myth,” Marcelo Leppe, the director of Chile’s National Antarctic Institute, had told me when I visited him the previous day in Punta Arenas, the capital of Chile’s southernmost region. “The changes are so great it is hard to put them in words,” he said. Since Leppe started studying the region in 2002, he had seen more and more visitors, and less and less snow. “I have seen glaciers retreat by 100 metres, and parts of the land become so green that it almost looks like a golf course,” he said. In December, monitoring equipment at the Chilean research base on King George Island detected something that worried Leppe even more: black carbon in the air, which came from the Australian bushfires more than 6,200 miles away. Even in tiny quantities, this soot darkens the white landscape, reducing its capacity to reflect sunlight and making it melt faster. “At least future geologists will find this black layer helpful to identify the year 2020 in their ice cores,” he joked darkly.There will be other clues for the geologists of the future. On 24 December 2019, the Antarctic probably suffered its worst one-day ice melt since records began, according to analysis by the University of Liège. In February, a mainland record of 18.3C was registered at the Argentinian base on the tip of the peninsula. Days later, a continental high of 20.75C was measured at a monitoring station on Seymour Island. On that day, on that island, the Antarctic was hotter than Cape Town.For the first two days, we sailed south in serene conditions, gazing in wonder at the seascape and wildlife. You can glimpse more species in the average London garden than on this immense continent, which covers an area the size of the US and Mexico combined. But what its residents lack in variety, they make up for in numbers.That was clear from our first short excursion at Trinity Island, which lies 150 miles southwest of King George Island. There we came across a vast number of chattering penguins, grunting seals and squawking cormorants – along with a startling number of tourists. There, and at our next stop in Paradise Harbour, we saw six giant cruise liners in the space of four days, disgorging groups of whale watchers on dinghies, adventure holidaymakers on kayaks, and red-jacketed trekkers wandering through guano-stained slopes. This southern hemisphere summer – which was the 200th anniversary of the first sighting of the Antarctic – a record 80,000 tourists were expected in the continent, an almost threefold increase from 2015. Before the coronavirus pandemic, shipbuilders had been seeing strong demand for polar- and ice-class cruise liners. Luxury cruise operators have tried to outdo one another with heated deck “igloos”, underwater lounges and extendable viewing platforms. Tourists pay as much as $10,000 (£8,500) or even $20,000 to experience what brochures describe as “the Earth’s last great wilderness frontier”. For our hyper-dominant species, part of the attraction of Antarctica is the chance to feel small in the presence of the sublime, to return to a time when nature seemed like an awe-inspiring and nurturing mother rather than the frail and overburdened grandparent it increasingly resembles today. To ensure that tourists feel like they are journeying through a nearly deserted wilderness, tour operators coordinate schedules and instruct captains to use radar to avoid visual sightings of other vessels. (As our polar guide, Tom Foreman, noted, the impression of solitude would be “somewhat ruined if you see 500 people floating past on another big lump of steel”.) If there is something absurd about tour companies expending so much energy on crafting the illusion of solitude, it does at least help avoid overcrowding. Biosecurity is no small matter in the Antarctic. Boots need to be sterilised before setting foot on land to avoid spreading seeds, fungi or viruses. Everyone must keep their distance from wildlife – five metres from a penguin, 10 metres from a seal, 50 metres from a whale, unless they come to you. And no littering. Over the past five years, Astrid Zafiro has watched the traffic to Antarctica grow. As chief of Argentina’s Admiral Brown base in Paradise Harbour, about 250 miles south-west of King George Island, she considers the rise in tourism as visible as the changes wrought by a warming climate. After guiding us through a penguin colony and up a slope behind the small research facility, Zafiro pointed across the bay at a newly emerged nunatak – a bare mountain peak sticking out above the ice. Near the nunatak, a massive cruise liner was unloading Chinese tourists in rubber boats. In the distance, we heard a crash as another slab of fractured glacier crashed into the water. “It is all happening right in front of us – the bay full of tourists, the ice breaking,” Zafiro said wistfully. Zafiro described a feedback loop that does not appear in climate models: the more the Antarctic is threatened by the climate crisis, the more tourists want to visit before it melts away. That means more cruise (and air) miles to the end of the Earth, more carbon dioxide and more global heating. Last-chance-to-see tourism becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. On board the Sunrise, a young German member of the ship’s crew, Carola Rackete, told me about “solastalgia”, the term coined by the philosopher Glenn Albrecht to describe the pre-emptive sense of loss that people feel when witnessing natural beauty in this era of environmental destruction. “You enjoy it knowing that next time it will be changed beyond recognition. There is always the anticipation of loss, which makes me feels sad,” Rackete said. Solastalgia is hard to escape in the Antarctic.We passed three days in Paradise Harbour, going out daily in the boats to gather samples and look and listen for whales, seals and penguins. On our final night, I was reluctant to sleep, knowing this was the last chance to take it all in. As the sun’s pale afterglow faded behind the mountains, the dusky bay was as smooth as polished chrome. Time itself seemed to have frozen and I began to understand why so many of the early Antarctic explorers felt close to God here. After a few moments, my transcendental musings were interrupted by the sound of KC and the Sunshine Band echoing out from a huge cruise liner anchored 100 or so metres away. “That’s the way, uh-huh uh-huh, I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh” continued to ring in my ears as I made my way to the cabin.There are still some Antarctic islands that have rarely, if ever, been visited by humans. They are deemed too small, too plain, too remote or too storm-battered. Our destination the following day, Low, seemed to tick all of these boxes. This south-westernmost island in the South Shetlands, nine miles long by five miles wide, takes the full brunt of the winds and waves that spin around the Shrieking Sixties, the stretch of latitude between 60 and 70 degrees south, which is notorious for howling gales.  Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https:uploads.guim20200408Chinstrap-penguin-sound.mp3 Avian census-taking starts with satellites. Penguin guano is the only excrement that can be seen from space. Over generations, the projectile poo from tens of thousands of krill-eating birds dyes rock a delicate pink. This makes colony spotting easy, but for more precise calculations, the team of four scientists use drones and artificial intelligence to count nests. Then, armed with handheld clickers, they head out to sample areas to double-check their findings. Each cluster is counted three times in a row to ensure wandering penguins do not evade the census. One member of the team, Noah Strycker, described the process to me as “a Zen-like activity”.Chinstraps have a reputation for being one of the noisiest and most aggressive of the penguin species. During courtship, the birds chat up potential mates with loud displays. After separating to gather food, they reunite with ecstatic greetings. If nests are threatened by predators, parents shriek protectively. Scientists have discovered that birds can filter out the background cacophony and focus in on the call of their own family members (the so-called “cocktail party effect”). But this skill becomes less essential as the chinstrap population diminishes, and the boisterous hubbub of the colony grows quieter. As we wandered from nest from nest to nest, totting up chicks, the loudest noise was from pubescent chicks nagging their parents for more regurgitated krill, the tiny shrimplike creature that constitutes the chinstrap’s only meal. Scientists believe this dependence on a single food source is one reason why chinstraps populations are plummeting. Krill graze on organisms that grow under the sea ice, so when the ice melts, the krill disappear in turn. By contrast, another species of penguin, the gentoo, is thriving, because it is far less fussy about its diet. The population final count is not yet complete, but it is already clear that the chinstraps on Low are just as vulnerable as elsewhere. And it is not only the penguins that are in danger. “Such a big decline over a short time suggests something is broken in the Southern Ocean ecosystem,” said Strycker.It was a sobering thought to sleep on Low amid that shifting climate. Our group may well have been the first in history to camp on the island. The polar guides had to tie the tents to boulders because there was no soil to bang pegs into. The tents withstood a cold night of wind and rain, but there was nothing anyone could do about the smell and the chatter. In the damp darkness, the penguins hunkered down, although they never fell completely silent. Thirty years ago, the noise would have been louder. The quietening of Low was far less soothing than it sounded.Over the next two days, the weather took a turn for the worse. With a storm brewing out at sea, we sheltered in Discovery Bay, an indent on the northern coast of Greenwich Island, waiting for a break in the clouds that refused to come. In the sea, the only signs of life were strings of salps – tiny tubes of transparent jelly with pink dots for bellies. As waters warm, these little zooplankton are thriving at the expense of krill, which is bad news for the ocean ecosystem and the climate because they are a lot less nutritious for predators, and they do not appear to play such a major role in helping the ocean absorb carbon dioxide. (Krill are better at this because they graze more on phytoplankton – tiny, plantlike organisms that absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen.) The change is another consequence of the ominous sound we had heard on the hydrophone several days earlier. As the Antarctic melt gets louder, there will be fewer chinstraps and krill, more gentoos and salps, less oxygen, more acid, and, of course, less land ice and more sea water.An increasing number of scientists believe the melting of West Antarctica is so far beyond natural fluctuations that it has become irreversible. In February, a first examination of the underside of the vast Thwaites glacier – which covers an area similar to that of the UK – showed extensive erosion by warm water. This and the nearby Pine Island glacier are now losing ice five times faster than in the 90s. A collapse of the west Antarctic ice sheet is now a serious concern. It might be tempting to think humanity can do nothing right, but the short history of human interaction with the Antarctic suggests we can at least learn from our mistakes and reverse some of the damage we have caused.The stratosphere high above our heads is proof of that. In the 1980s, the world was horrified to discover that certain chemicals had thinned the ozone layer and opened up a vast hole above the Antarctic that was raising cancer risks and disrupting weather systems and ocean currents. Since then, however, international efforts to reduce CFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals have eased that threat. This year, scientists were relieved to find that disruption of southern wind systems has paused and may even be returning towards its natural state. There is a risk that a closed ozone hole will trap more heat, but the initial damage is on its way to being repaired. This is also true of wildlife in the region. For 4.5bn years, not a single whisper was carried on the winds or the waves of this region. It was only 200 years ago, years after the invention of the steam engine and electric lighting, that humans first caught sight of Antarctica. The explorers who first mapped the continent were lauded as heroes, but carnage often followed in their wake. James Clark Ross – the British naval officer who discovered the sea now named after him – knew exactly what would happen to the seals and penguins he saw on his voyage. “Hitherto beyond the reach of their persecutors, they have enjoyed a life of tranquillity and security, but will now, no doubt, be made to contribute to the wealth of our country,” he wrote in his diary in 1841.Like seals and penguins before them, whales appeared to be doomed. But unfashionable regulations and often unpopular campaigning have made a difference. Steady increases since the moratorium on commercial whaling that came into effect in 1985 have taken southern hemisphere humpbacks close to their pre-exploitation population of about 80,000, according to the International Whaling Commission. The scientists on the Greenpeace ships are helping to track whale populations by collecting vast amounts of acoustic data, such as the communal chatter of a pod of orcas and the thunderous clicks of the sperm whale, the loudest natural sound made by any creature on Earth. Thrillingly, blue whales are also making a comeback. Last month, a British Antarctic Survey mission to South Georgia recorded 55 in just three weeks. For campaigners, the recovery of whales is a much-needed reminder that international cooperation can be effective, protections can work, and our species is capable of undoing the damage we inflicted on the natural world. But nobody is complacent. The actor Gustaf Skarsgård, who had joined the trip in order to promote conservation to his social media followers, summed it up with a personal comparison. “It’s like Antarctica is in recovery. I know a thing or two about that,” he said. “A low point has passed but the condition is still fragile. It needs more time or it could slip back again.” After the storm finally abated, the Sunrise sailed back to King George Island, from where I would have to take a plane home. The closer we came to the airport, the more cruise ships and scientific vessels we saw. In the 10 days since we had left, summer had taken a visible toll. Hillsides that had been covered in snow were now bare, black rock. The naked Antarctic will never be a tourist draw, but it is a powerful reminder that underneath the Earth’s fragile outer layer of water, ice, earth and vegetation, this is just another rock hurtling through space.Of all the moments during the trip, one stands out – an encounter in Paradise Harbour that stirred two rare feelings in the age of the Anthropocene: pure unmitigated joy and a nascent sense of hope.I heard the humpback before I saw it. A ripple, a sigh, then a soft splash behind my back. I turned in time to see the dorsal fin arc languorously out and back into the water just like a fairytale sketch of a sea serpent. The whale was about 30 metres away, and coming towards us. We couldn’t move – the coxswain had cut the boat’s engine a few minutes earlier in preparation for a hydrophone recording. All we could do was look on, speechless, as the whale drew nearer, 15 metres now, snorting water once again from its blowhole, then slipping just far enough below the surface to be out of sight. It was thrilling. Did the whale realise there was an obstacle in its path? Our small boat would surely be upturned in a collision with a creature that size. The whale had something else in mind. After passing just below the surface a few metres from the front of our craft, it turned parallel and so close we could almost reach out and touch it. Then the whale tilted its giant head out of the water and yawned cavernously, revealing a bed-sized tongue and the bristled carpet of its baleen plates. Seconds later, with a flick of its knobbled pectoral fin, it was under the water again. Mouths agape, beaming rapturously, the five of us looked at each other to confirm we had not imagined what we had seen. I cannot remember sharing such joy. The experience felt almost holy. But it wasn’t over. We turned around, and there was the whale again, completing a full circle of the boat, before silently swimming back the way it had come.We returned to the ship on a high. We were too excited to capture the encounter with any great skill. Nobody had pushed the record switch on the hydrophone. The clip I filmed on my phone was partly obscured by other bodies. Never mind. The moment would linger long in the memory. By listening, we had seen so much.Jonathan Watts’s time on board the Arctic Sunrise was funded by Greenpeace"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4226088.1586534850!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"leaving cert postponed until late summer junior cycle replaced with class tests","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe closure of schools, colleges and childcare facilities was ordered from Thursday, March 12th. Photograph: Eric LukeThe Leaving Cert exams scheduled in June are to be postponed and will now run from late July until August, the Government has announced.The Junior Cycle, meanwhile, is set to be replaced by school-based exams which will run in the new academic year.The changes mean tens of thousands of students who are due to progress to third level and further education are likely to commence their courses much later than they originally anticipated.Deadlines for students to complete practicals and project work in a number of subjects such as history, geography and home economics will also be extended until late July.Students had been given a deadline of Friday May 15th to complete this work.While the move will bring much-needed clarity to students over contingency plans the Leaving Cert, it is likely to be a major disappointment for many students who now face an extended summer preparing for the exams.Last week a survey of almost 30,000 Leaving Cert students by the Irish Second Level Students’ Union found that almost half (49 per cent) wanted to cancel the exams and use already-completed coursework to decide their grades.The least popular option was rescheduling exams to July or August (19 per cent).Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Minister for Education Joe McHugh made the announcement at at press conference on Friday afternoon.The decision followed doubts that Covid-19 restrictions would be lifted in time for the usual June start date for the exams.Last month, the Government cancelled oral and practical performance tests that were due to tale place between March and April. All students who were due to take these tests will be awarded full marks for this portion of the exam. Minister McHugh said at the time: “This is a difficult time for all. Students are facing a challenging period out of school and our decision on this element of the exams is being taken with their best interests at heart. “It is the fairest response we could take in the circumstances. It guarantees that no student will score less than they would have if schools had been operating as normal.” In a joint statement on the announcement, the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, (ACCS) Education and Training Boards Ireland (ETBI), Joint Managerial Body (JMB) and National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals (NAPD) said they appreciated the clarity. “This brings certainty for students at this difficult time as they continue to prepare for their Leaving Certificate and Junior Cycle Exams,” the organisations said. “We would like to acknowledge the ongoing work of the students, teachers and management in our school communities in dealing with the unique and challenging circumstances we are presented with at this time in such a positive and productive manner.”In light of the revised schedule, the organisations said, students should “take a complete break from their studies in this Easter period so that they can return refreshed and renewed to the learning process”.Separately, second level teachers’ unions ASTI and TUI said their executive committees would meet remotely on Friday evening to consider how best to proceed.“We remain committed to serving the best interests of students, as evidenced by the wholehearted engagement of teachers with remote teaching and learning over recent weeks,” the unions said in a joint statement. “We are conscious of the enormity of the challenges facing our society now, and we are appreciative of the work done by all concerned to meet these challenges.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Leon FarrellPhotocallPAThe restrictions imposed by the Government which were due to expire on Sunday are to be extended until May 5th, another three weeks, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has announced.The recommendation to extend the controls was made by the National Public Health Emergency Team today and accepted by the Government.Mr Varadkar said because the vast majority of people have complied with the restrictions the spread of coronavirus has been interrupted. However, while the spread had been slowed significantly it has not been stopped.Too many people have died and more will have died “before it’s all over”, the Taoiseach told a briefing in Government Buildings, Dublin, on Friday.He said people could not afford to become complacent or lose focus and “we need to persevere” and to maintain our discipline and resolve.The Government was planning for a return to normality, he said, but for now we have to “take one day at a time”.Mr Varadkar said he hoped that after the three-week period the curtailment of social and commercial activity could be unwound but added that he could not guarantee this. Whether this happens will depend on how people respond to the restrictions and the behaviours required.“They won’t be eased in one go. It will have to be done bit by bit,” said Mr Varadkar. The controls might also have to be reimposed if the virus “rises again”.Mr Varadkar acknowledged many people were feeling frustrated and captive under the regulations and and that the fine weather makes things more difficult.Ireland would be watching how other countries such as Denmark, Austria and the Czech Republic got on in easing their restrictions in the coming weeks, he said.“This is not an experiment we’re willing to take” at this point, he said.However, every personal sacrifice was helping to save life and to ensure the health service is not overwhelmed, he added.These sacrifices have made a difference, he said, thanking the public for its “forbearance”.What might be an inconvenience for some could be a “lifesaver” for others.Minister for Health Simon Harris confirmed the extra powers given to gardaí to enforce the restrictions will be extended for three weeks before Sunday, when they were due to expire.Mr Harris said the actions of public had made a “real and meaningful” difference. The number of contacts of confirmed cases had been cut from 20 to two, the daily growth rate of infection has been cut from 33 per cent to under 10 per cent and the number of people infected by each case was down from over four to about one.“You are flattening the curve. You are protecting front-line health workers. You are saving so many lives.”“Hard days for a bit longer are so worth it for better days ahead,” he concluded.Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said the aim would be to have a testing regime in place by the end of the three-week period that would provide same-day or next-day results so the virus could be properly tracked.Minister for Education Joe McHugh said that schools would remain closed “until further notice”. The Junior Certificate examinations are cancelled but the Leaving Certificate exams will be rescheduled until late July or August, depending on public health advice and talks with the teaching unions.Rescue package Also on Friday Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said the Government may need limited access to the new European Union Covid-19 rescue package to help fund the wage-subsidy scheme and support companies in difficulty.Mr Donohoe said he is confident the country can create “a new economy” and services to recover but he cautioned, “we have a journey ahead of us.”The new welfare supports will be monitored and may need to be strengthened to aid the recovery as 200,000 workers access the wage subsidy scheme. “If they need to be changed we will do so.”Mr Donohoe said the deal reached with EU finance ministers on Thursday night has three different elements.The first is to make loans available to countries in major difficulty to help their healthcare ability to respond to Covid-19 second, there is a company plan – to use European Investment Bank to make money available to companies at low interest rates to respond to Covid-19 and a third plan for workers to help companies pay for wage subsidy schemes.What about the courts?Also on Friday Liz Canavan from the Department of the Taoiseach said the Court Services is piloting technology that will allow full court hearings to be held remotely once the new legal term begins after Easter. At the daily briefing from the Government press centre, it was disclosed that until now remote hearings using video links have been used for the most urgent cases. Some 570 employers have not disclosed their bank details to Revenue, the briefing also heard resulting in employees missing out on €2.19 million in top-up payments. Ms Canavan said this has been an issue with a minority of employers since the beginning who have not yet registered with the Revenue On-Line Service. Ms Canavan reiterated the Government message to ask people to stay at home this Easter and not to take “unnecessary journeys” to holiday homes.

Photograph: Crispin RodwellThe .Traffic on all the main routes out of Dublin has dropped over the last 24 hours suggesting that a major Garda operation to deter people from going to holiday homes is having some effect. A significant Garda operation involving 2,500 officers at hundreds of check points around the country is in place in a bid to deter people from travelling to holiday locations for the Easter weekend. On Wednesday the Garda was given sweeping new powers to enforce Government restrictions due to concerns that there was some slippage in the public adherence to the restrictions. These include a fine of up to €2,500 and up to six months in jail for those who ignore a Garda instruction to return to their place of residence. Overall traffic leaving the east coast earlier this week was about 5 per cent above recent, post-coronavirus levels. This lasted until Wednesday when gardaí revealed the extent of the crackdown. By 10am on Friday the numbers of cars on all routes had fallen significantly.Speeding However, the Garda said despite the presence of some 2,500 gardaí at checkpoints on roads across the State, some of which are operating round-the-clock, some motorists were taking advantage of reduced traffic and near empty roads to travel at speeds of up to twice the legal limit. Some speed detections in the last week included a motorist going 185kph in a 100kph zone on the N22, in Cork and somebody going 225kph in a 120kph zone on the M1 in Dublin.The Garda Operation is in response to restrictions imposed by Government following the Covid- 19 outbreak. The restrictions stipulate that people should not to make any journeys except to travel for essential work, attend medical appointments, shop for essential food, medicines or household supplies and to provide vital care for family members.Apart from this, all journeys more than 2km from home should be avoided.Health Minister Simon Harris has raised concerns about a possible surge in patients later this month if people from the east of the country - where there are most confirmed cases of coronavirus - decide to travel to the holiday homes elsewhere on the island for the Easter weekend.The Garda operation - Operation Fanacht - runs until Monday and in addition to roads policing it has involved gardaí visiting parks, beauty spots, mountains and beaches. On Thursday afternoon members of the Garda Water Unit visited Terryglass in Co Tipperary to advise locals that not just boating but fishing and a range of waterside pursuits should be postponed. Deputy commissioner John Twomey said it was “vital” that compliance with the restrictions continues over the coming days and over the weekend. Traffic countersA direction was issued to every Garda superintendent on Wednesday, a day after gardaí were granted sweeping new powers to arrest and prosecute people failing to comply with travel restrictions designed to stem the spread of coronavirus. It instructed front line gardaí to utilise a four-step “graduated policing response”, engaging with transgressors, explaining the rules, encouraging them to obey and the final step being enforcement. Traffic counters on the main roads between 9 am and 10am on Friday morning showed numbers of vehicles approaching Gorey, Co Wexford were down from 879 a week previously to 744. Further north on the N11 south of Kilmacanogue the numbers had fallen by about 7 per cent in the hour to 10am. Traffic volumes coming from the M50 to the N7 in west Dublin were down from 2,144 at 10am a week ago to 1,916 this morning. At Liffey Valley the numbers were down from 4,963 to 4,709.At Blanchardstown the number of vehicles heading out of Dublin on the N3 were 1575 in the hour to 10 am a week ago to 1,381 this morning. On the M1 just north of Dublin Airport the numbers were down from 2,028 to 1,620. Google traffic reported heavy congestion on the N11 near Kilmacanogue, likely caused by the presence of a 24-hour Garda road checkpoint.

File photograph: Alan BetsonThe Immunology expert Professor Kingston Mills has called on the Government to question airlines about the necessity for passenger flights in and out of Ireland. “For the last number of weeks I’ve been looking on the Dublin airport website and seeing substantial numbers of passenger flights to-ing and fro-ing from Europe, ” he told RTÉ’s Today with Séan O’Rourke show on Friday. “The Government has to talk to the airlines perhaps and say do you need to have these flights? Or put in place the restrictions already in place in New Zealand - I think there is a need for stricter measures here.“That’s one element that caused a lot of problems early in the pandemic – we allowed flights still to come from Northern Italy and from other areas that brought in a lot of the early cases, now we have community spread of the virus and that’s a big issue.“There were two ways of dealing with this – one you either keep people indoors and stop them from coming in contact with each other – that can be effective. The other way which China and Korea did very effectively is contact tracing of everybody who was in contact with somebody infected, we’re not doing that here.”However, Prof Kingston warned that this would completely over power the testing facilities here. “We’re not doing contact tracing to the extent that it was done in China or Korea. The capacity is not there to do it,” he added. “If somebody is infected in the community everybody who was in contact with them is not being tested. That needs to be done, if you want an alternative to lockdown.”Scheduled to travelFewer than 1,000 people are scheduled to travel through Dublin airport on Friday, with the actual number of passengers expected to turn up likely to be less. There would typically be more than 100,000 passengers flying through the airport at Easter, according to DAA, which operates and manages Dublin and Cork airports. There are 86 flights due to arrive and depart from Dublin airport – 14 of which are cargo flights and four which stop in Dublin for refuelling. “Dublin airport is open as an essential service for cargo and repatriation flights in line with Irish government policy,” a DAA spokeswoman said. “Fewer than 1,000 passengers are scheduled to travel today, however the actual number of passengers that will turn up is expected to be less than that.”The HSE has staff at Dublin airport and all arriving passengers are being informed they need to limit their movements for 14 days. “Health and travel policies in relation to Covid-19 are set by the Irish Government and Dublin airport has been complying fully with those guidelines since the start of the public health crisis,” the DAA spokeswoman added. FerriesIrish Ferries said it is continuing to operate schedules linking Ireland to Britain and France, which play “a critical role in the supply chain, ensuring our supermarket shelves remain stocked and important pharmaceutical and medical supplies are shipped”. “While these services are also available for essential travel, such as repatriation, travel for essential workers, or to care for loved ones or vulnerable relatives, the governments in Ireland, Britain and France have introduced restricted movement measures, and Irish Ferries is advising its passengers of the terms of these measures,” a spokesman for Irish Ferries said. “Irish Ferries continues to adapt its procedures and services on board in accordance with published advice and guidance from relevant health authorities.” Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4226011.1586524165!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus satan and a virus won t close some us churches on sunday","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMajor US religious institutions, including Roman Catholic dioceses and major Protestant denominations, will hold religious services online as well as through local broadcast radio and television.

He expects a crowd of more than 2,000 to gather in worship at his megachurch on Sunday. “God will shield us from all harm and sickness,” Spell said in an interview.UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres has warned that the coronavirus pandemic is threatening international peace and security as world leaders warn against relaxing social distancing rules during Easter.Mr Guterres told the UN Security Council the pandemic could potentially lead “to an increase in social unrest and violence that would greatly undermine our ability to fight the disease”.The council is the UN’s most powerful body and it has been silent on Covid-19 since it started circling the globe in January. But after Thursday’s meeting the council issued its first brief press statement, saying it expressed “support for all efforts of the secretary-general concerning the potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic to conflict-affected countries”.It came after world leaders and health officials warned that hard-won gains in the fight against coronavirus must not be jeopardised by relaxing social distancing over the Easter holidays.A spike in deaths in the UK and New York and surges of reported new infections in Japan and in India’s congested cities make it clear that the battle is far from over.“We are flattening the curve because we are rigorous about social distancing,” New York governor Andrew Cuomo said. “But it’s not a time to be complacent. It’s not a time to do anything different than we’ve been doing.” Worldwide, the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases has climbed to nearly 1.5 million, with almost 90,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. The true numbers are almost certainly much higher.USThe US has by far the most confirmed cases, with more than 430,000 people infected - three times the number of the next three countries combined.Numbers released by the US government showed that 6.6 million American workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, on top of more than 10 million in the two weeks before that.That amounts to about one in 10 American workers, the biggest, fastest pileup of job losses since the world’s largest economy began keeping records in 1948.EuropeThe number of people dying of coronavirus in Spain each day fell again on Friday as the country registered 605 fatalities over the past 24 hours, the health ministry said.

Photograph: Oliver HosletReutersThe European Union released a draft of its hoped-for future relationship deal with Britain on Wednesday, setting out ambitions for a tight relationship on trade and security.The 440-page document crosses several of Britain’s red lines, spelling out the bloc’s ambitions for Britain to agree “uniform implementation” of state subsidy rules, with the European Court of Justice remaining the adjudicating authority.It also makes reference to the so-called “level playing field”, provisions to ensure fair competition by keeping rules aligned, which London has already rejected.“The Parties recognise that the establishment of conditions that ensure a level playing field between the Parties is necessary for trade and investment between the Union and the United Kingdom, ” the draft reads.The EU’s draft envisages reciprocal access to waters for fishing rights, with negotiations held each year by December 10th on fishing opportunities for the following year, another contentious point.The UK negotiating team said it had also sent a draft to the EU. This includes a free trade agreement with annexes, as well as agreements on aviation safety and air transport, and a civil nuclear agreement.“We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,” a government spokesman said.“Teams will now analyse each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.“We will keep under review which documents it is appropriate to publish during the course of negotiations and whether it is useful to make them availablle more widely.”Though Britain has left the EU it is is currently in a transition period, continuing to adhere to prior norms pending the agreement of a deal on the future relationship. If none can be agreed, it will automatically begin trading on World Trade Organisation terms from January 1st, 2021, with potentially severe effects on the Irish economy.The government of prime minister Boris Johnson has until July to request an extension to the transition period, but has insisted it will not do so even as the Coronavirus pandemic delayed talks this week.Both sides said they were examining options such as using video conferencing in place of face-to face talks.“The negotiations can still proceed given all of the logistical arrangements that have been put in place,” British foreign secretary Dominic Raab said on Tuesday.“We’re confident that we can get this done and, actually, I don’t think delaying Brexit negotiations would give anyone the certainty on either side of the Channel that they need.”Stay on top of the latest news with our Morning Briefing and Lunchtime Latest newsletters"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons april 2020","story":"Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraphmatt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2019 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to https:telegraph.newsprints or call 0191 603 0178Boris Johnson able to do \u0026#39short walks\u0026#39 as part of his recovery, as No 10 gives coronavirus update - watch liveThese are the NHS workers who have died from coronavirusNicola Sturgeon urged to match UK Government’s support for businesses during coronavirus crisisComment: Why policing the coronavirus lockdown is an impossible task - that will lead to wrongful convictionsFrom The Good Life to Broadchurch: the best TV shows to watch on BritboxVolunteers itching to give their time told the care service \u0026#39needs you more than ever\u0026#39 Comment: It might cost more to buy British, but right now our farmers need it Robert Jenrick\u0026#39s judgement lapse is Government\u0026#39s first real test in Boris Johnson\u0026#39s absenceDomestic carbon offsetting market could raise millions for UK nature projects, report saysComment: You shouldn\u0026#39t have to defend a visit to the park if you\u0026#39re cooped up in a tiny urban flatUS evangelical megachurches to open for Easter Sunday so \u0026#39Satan doesn\u0026#39t win\u0026#39Coronavirus positive: good news round-up - silver surfers set for improved connection speedsPhilippines bans healthcare workers leaving country to workBoris Johnson in hospital for coronavirus – latest news on his recoveryHow does a coronavirus antibody home test kit work, and how do I get one?When will the UK lockdown end?

This draft proposal could signal a game-changer moment for animal protection in China, said Wendy Higgins, of Humane Society International.The proposed restrictions come as wet markets begin to reopen in Wuhan, where the new strain of coronavirus which has engulfed the globe first surfaced. However, a ban on slaughtering and selling live animals remains in place.Scientists and Chinese officials believe the deadly virus  jumped to humans from wild animals, via creatures such as bats.Close contact with wild animals at the markets, which had been closed since January, has been widely blamed for the outbreak.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus entered new york europe not asia researchers find","story":"One study has found an early case of the virus in the city was in all likelihood indirectly transmitted by an inidual who brought it across from Britain.But while President Donald Trump barred foreign nations at the end of January from entering the US if they had been in China, it was not until mid-March that similar restrictions were placed on travellers from most European countries.Researchers suggest that by this point travellers had already been returning to New York with coronavirus from countries such as Italy.They found that the Long Island patient’s viral genome correlated with that of a strain circulating in Britain. That suggested the patient had contact with someone who had brought the virus over from the UK.Scientists at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital have written a study also indicating that coronavirus began to circulate in the New York area by mid-February, weeks before the first confirmed case, and that the travelers who brought in the virus did not arrive from Asia.Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at Icahn who co-wrote the study, which is awaiting peer review, told The New York Times: “The majority is clearly European.” Both teams examined genomes from coronaviruses taken from New Yorkers from mid-March.Their research appears to suggest that the previously hidden spread of the virus might have been detected earlier if more testing had been in place.China announced at the end of December that doctors in Wuhan were treating dozens of cases of a new respiratory illness.A few countries, such as Singapore, launched an aggressive testing program to identify the arrival of the virus and trace its spread through the population.But the US initially limited testing only to people who had come from China in the two weeks before January 31 and displayed symptoms of Covid-19.Dr Heguy said: “It was a disaster that we didn’t do testing. People were just oblivious.”One passenger, Pam Mundus, who returned home on a direct flight from Rome to JFK on March 1, said at the time that no one questioned her about her visit to Italy, or whether she might have been exposed to the virus. Early findings suggest that the virus was in New York well before a woman in her 30s from Manhattan became the city’s first official patient on March 1.Dr Viviana Simon, of the team, said in a statement that the results indicate that the coronavirus “came to New York City and environs predominantly via untracked transmission between the United States and Europe, with only limited introduction from China, where the virus originated.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus next 100 days future uk economy health","story":"On new year\u0027s eve last year the first case of Covid-19 was reported to the WHO. As of today, Thursday 9 April 2020, we are one hundred days in to living with the virus.We asked our expert journalists to look ahead and forecast what the next 100 days will hold. What is the outlook for their sector? Which key questions must be answered? And what will their world look like 100 days from now, on Saturday 18 July? The areas covered are as follows: The UK, the world, science, politics, the NHS, lockdown and social distancing, the economy, small and medium businesses, personal finance, property, sport, the arts, environment, education, mental health, physical health, travel and Brexit.These are their responses.If the first 100 days of this pandemic have been characterised by collective shock, denial and now frustration, we should expect the next three months to be marked by our adaptability. It’s what pychologists call the Kübler-Ross model, or the “five stages of grief”, and is a useful way of thinking about what the coronavirus holds for us over the weeks and months ahead. The model is usually shown as a bowl-shaped curve with the “shock” on the high left, a steep descent into depression and then a slow but steady rise to a new normal.The upward slope of the curve may have been what The Queen had in mind when she told the nation on Sunday: While we have faced challenges before, this one is different. We join with all nations across the globe in a common endeavour, using the great advances of science and our instinctive compassion to heal. We will succeed – and that success will belong to every one of us”.The shock of the past 100 days has been brutal, but the green shoots of recovery are becoming evident. The way we came together to demand a lockdown in order to protect the most vulnerable among us is testament not just to our humanity but our good sense. Darwinian forces may have shaped us but we see ourselves as a society not a herd. You see it too in the millions of small chores and errands people all over the country are running for those less able than themselves.Scientists from all disciplines have also grown in stature and confidence. They are displacing ideology with evidence and knee jerk reaction with reasoned decision making. They are also embracing cross-border cooperation and transparency like never before. One of the first papers providing hard evidence that infection with the coronavirus creates protective antibodies in our blood was published yesterday by a team of Chinese scientists and shared instantly around the world. In the same vein, the once secretive scientific committees advising ministers in Britain have taken to publishing, not just the abbreviated minutes of their meetings, but the substance too in order that others can constantly test and critique their decision making.Even the public are becoming involved. Perhaps the best view we have of the spread of the coronavirus in Britain is provided by data from the Covid Symptom Tracker app, used by over two million ordinary Brits. The latest figures estimate that 1.4 million people in the UK aged 20-69 have symptomatic Covid-19, a fall from 1.9 million on the 1 April.While scientists are working round the clock on treatments and vaccines, thousands of other experts are collaborating on the economics and logistics of getting our factories, schools and high streets up and running again.Don’t expect lockdown to end within the next 100 days but we will almost certainly know the shape of it by then.Life is unlikely to fully return to normal until a vaccine or treatment is found but with good planning and direction from the top, it should be possible for large parts of society to be at least partially freed-up without the virus spiking dangerously again and overwhelming the NHS..If there is a risk in front of us, and there surely is, it comes less from the virus itself but the profound economic and political shock which the world will experience in its wake. We know from history that such shocks like this can spark conflict and already China and the US are squaring up to each other, stoking palpable fear and tensions.Covid-19 has exposed the world’s frailties and its strengths: we humans have a long established habit of messing up before dusting ourselves down and starting over again. Be in no doubt, we will get back on our feet. The only real variable is how many people will die unnecessarily in the process.There are really only three kinds of country in the world today: those slowly waking from the coronavirus nightmare those in the middle of it and those who are about to be hit.All face the same brutal dilemma: how to balance human lives and public health with economic sustainability.Over the next few weeks each will see their latent weaknesses, and perhaps strengths, exposed in unforgiving light. And the outcomes will vary dramatically according to national wealth.China, South Korea, and Japan, the advanced economies which suffered the first wave of the coronavirus crisis, will try to ease their city lockdowns without allowing a resurgence of the virus.But early signs are that it will be a tricky and long-drawn out process. Tellingly China has still not rescheduled the annual meeting of the National People\u0027s Congress, which was postponed in March, suggesting Beijing is not quite confident that progress is irreversible.Meanwhile, developed countries in Europe and North America where the epidemic has yet to peak will remain focussed on saving lives. Lockdowns may be extended into the early summer, and tensions over the economic, social, and political consequences will rise.The mounting death rate in the United States in particular poses an immense challenge to president Donald Trump in the run-up to November\u0027s presidential election, and could challenge orthodoxies around healthcare.Everywhere, the global economic slowdown will have knock-on effects with as yet impossible to predict consequences.The Kremlin\u0027s spokesman warned Russians last weekend to be braced for a perfect storm economic crisis lasting up to two years.  But alarmingly, a third wave hitting the developing world is only now taking off.With neither the healthcare capacity to handle multiple cases nor the economic reserves to survive the shutdowns that saved lives in Europe and East Asia, the outbreaks are likely to last longer and claim many more lives.Aid agencies are especially worried about conflict zones like Libya, where an outbreak of the virus has failed to slow the fighting, and refugee camps, where cramped conditions and rudimentary sanitation mean thousands of people will likely die if the virus takes hold.  In the world\u0027s largest refugee camps in Cox\u0027s Bazaar, Bangladesh, there is not a single venilator for more than 800,000 Rohingya refugees who fled a genocide in Myanmar in 2017. Médicines sans Frontier have described the camps, which are overcrowded and unsanitary as a ticking time bomb.The first 100 days of the coronavirus have brought the economy to a ‘hard stop’ the likes of which has never been seen before.Preventative action to stop the spread of the pandemic has forced the shutdown of swathes of British and global productive capacity.The next 100 days begins with a reckoning in the jobs market. Economists expect GDP to fall by as much as 20 per cent by the end of April.JP Morgan estimates such a fall would be expected to push up unemployment from below 4 per cent at the start of the year to as much as 13 per cent - far worse than the financial crisis or the recessions of the 1980s and 1990s.Almost 1m have signed up for benefits already. Typically that would cause serious scarring as some of the unemployed lose touch with the world of work for years, finding it hard to get a job and seeing their skills lose value as they are not kept up to date with modern employment.If the furlough schemes and business support efforts work the unemployment rate could be limited to around 7 per cent, staving off the worst social and economic effects of the crunch.The next key factor is the length of the shutdown. If restrictions begin to be eased in May, a rapid bounceback seems possible. Retail and hospitality can begin to reopen, bit by bit.Domestic travel can recommence. Workers on furlough or working from home can get back to normal work. Government efforts to ‘bridge’ this period with grants, loans and wage payments will have largely succeeded in keeping the economy from collapse.“We expect the economy to rebound quite swiftly, should quarantine measures be lifted sometime before the third quarter,” says economist Sanjay Raja at Deutsche Bank.This would not restore the economy to its previous peak instantly. International travel and large-scale events will take longer to return to normal. Lost education, training and investment could also take time to be recovered.Behaviours could change, too. Businesses and households may build up more savings to keep themselves safe from any ‘second wave’ or other future lockdown. That is the good scenario.But if the shutdown carries on into June or even to the end of the next 100 days, the economy could look very different.More businesses and jobs will have been lost for good. Those who are still standing risk lower incomes or higher debts. Businesses will be less willing to fund new investment in a weaker economy, and workers risk losing their skills after a prolonged period of forced rest.In that case, a long depression could lie ahead.In early January the World Health Organization issued an alert warning that a “pneumonia of unknown cause” had been identified in Wuhan, China. Just a few days later the mystery illness was confirmed to be a novel coronavirus and within a week Chinese scientists had published its full genetic sequence. Since then, experts across the globe have been scrambling to uncover the virus’ secrets. While miracles will not happen overnight, never before have scientists been so united in a common pursuit – and already a remarkable amount of progress has been made. “There is this spirit of collaboration,” Nick Cammack, therapeutics accelerator lead at the Wellcome Trust, told The . “Science is the exit strategy.” Looking forward, there are three key areas that experts are honing in on. The first is to answer the outstanding unknowns: How many of us have already had the virus? How common are asymptomatic carriers? And how much immunity, if any, do we acquire after surviving an infection?Widespread antibody testing will unlock many of these answers, as accurate assays will be able to detect prior infections and identify whether we are approaching widespread immunity. Scientists at the UK’s high tech, high security facility at Porton Down near Salisbury are among those who have already started this work – expect answers in the near future. Identifying effective treatments is another essential area of focus. While experts have started to track down completely new compounds that could be used to attack the coronavirus in the future, the most promising option right now is to repurpose existing drugs.Antimalarial treatments first tested during the Second World War (chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine), a combination drug used to treat HIV patients (ritonavir and lopinavir) and an antiviral first developed to treat Ebola (remdesivir) have all been pitted as potential cures, alongside convalescent plasma therapy and anti-inflammatories.While hundreds of clinical trials have started during the pandemic, it is the “megatrials” launched by the WHO, University of Oxford and French firm Inserm that will offer the most conclusive results as they have the largest sample sizes. Initial results for some of the potential therapies could start to emerge within a month. The final, and perhaps most critical, tool is a vaccine. About 35 companies and academic institutes are racing to create an inoculation and four candidates have already been tested in animals – but experts have warned it will be at least a year, if not 18 months, until a safe vaccine is ready for widespread use. Efforts are under way to speed this process up. Bill Gates announced this week that he would build factories to manufacture the seven most promising vaccines – even though this would “waste” billions of dollars, as the Gates Foundation would only ever mass produce two candidates. It’s a sign, if you needed one, of just how seriously the international community is taking the coronavirus threat. “Science is the exit strategy” might be a savvy soundbite, but it’s also true. The NHS has worked at full throttle to plan for the peak of the coronavirus outbreak, creating 10,000 extra intensive care beds at NHS Nightingale Hospitals and asking tens of thousands of retired medics and students to join the fight. Consultant surgeons have retrained as ICU nurses, as operating theatres and labour wards have been converted into Covid-19 wards.  When the peak comes in the next 10 to 20 days, with London and the West Midlands expected to come first, we will see if the preparations were sufficient.Staffing will be a major pinch point. A workforce deficit of 100,000 before the crisis will be compounded by medics going off sick - up to 25 per cent of staff are already self-isolating, according to the highest estimates. Increased testing will help, but medics will need to adapt.Nurses in ICU, who normally look after one patient at a time, could be asked to monitor half a dozen at once, while doctors will improvise with anaesthetic machines when ventilators are all in use and move patients around the hospital to maintain oxygen pressure. After insufficient amounts of PPE equipment were delivered in the early days of the crisis, fixes to the supply chain should hold up.As hospitals reach capacity, ambulances will be re-routed to NHS Nightingale Hospitals. NHS Providers has early confidence that hospitals won’t become overwhelmed, as they were in Italy, but is concerned about the effect on community services, such as GPs and social care. Frontline charities, such as St John\u0027s Ambulance, will need to draw on new funding from the Government in order to support the NHS.Coronavirus deaths will be commonplace, and medics will find themselves standing in for loved ones. They will facilitate video calls with family members, play comforting music, and hold patients\u0027 hands as they take their last breath. Medics will also die. There could also be a rise in non-corona deaths, as patients avoid going to A\u0026ampE and miss out on treatment.After the peak hospital admissions will plateau, but it will take weeks for the effect to be seen on wards as critical patients recover. Lockdown measures will help avoid a second peak, while contact tracing and immunity testing will become key.“People are putting on brave faces when in fact they are crying inside,” one ICU doctor tells me. NHS staff will rely upon a new NHS mental health helpline and ‘wobble rooms’ to ease the burden, but some will suffer from PTSD. Without a doubt, though, they will continue to work as hard as they can.As Dr Qian Xu, an A\u0026ampE doctor, says, “We are all scared, just like everyone else, but we have a professional duty to fight this war.The lockdown has obviously pushed us further apart. We can\u0027t see loved ones we can\u0027t go to work the public sphere, famously described by Jurgen Habermas as the place where ideas and experiences are freely exchanged, is gone. Even if we do go for a walk, we have to keep two metres apart, and our faces are hidden behind masks. This is deeply ironic given how much time Europe spent debating whether or not women should wear the Burqa.On the other hand, this is the closest we\u0027ve come to a collective experience in years. We are suddenly watching the same news and digesting the same information. We\u0027re probably talking to each other more than ever over phone and internet, and hundreds of thousands have volunteered to help the NHS. There is evident national pride at the construction of NHS Nightingale, the largest critical unit in the world, in just nine days.Criticism of politicians and suspicion that we might be getting this wrong, is balanced by the feeling that we\u0027re all in this together, even if all we can do is shout hello from a safe distance.But these are early days. Lockdown Britain is going to have to process two traumas. First, death. People die all the time, but rarely in one go and with the same condition, and never with this degree of media attention. Given the scale of mortality it\u0027s likely that almost every family will be touched by it but, due to the lockdown, we\u0027ll be denied many of the usual rites and companionship that we rely upon to cope with grief.Second, we are going to have to confront the trauma of prolonged boredom, unemployment and loneliness. There\u0027s been growing awareness in recent years of the link between mental and physical health, that if you are depressed or unstimulated, physical problems follow. Well, now we are engaged in a mass experiment in enforced isolation or, just as difficult, being stuck with the same person for a long period of time. One suspects that as frustrations increase, so will tensions between the generations.The phrase things will never be the same again is almost as over-familiar as stay at home - but it\u0027s not necessarily true.Some things will go straight back to normal when the lockdown ends because we miss them and we want them back: the pubs will be jam-packed and flights will sell out. But the Coronavirus could always return for another season, or some other disease, so we are likely to be left feeling very vulnerable for a long time.Sport’s shutdown narrowly allowed the real Cheltenham Gold Cup and has just given us the Virtual Grand National. In between, the industry’s business model has been exposed as over-reliant on TV deals and reckless with its salaries for players.Pent-up longing will bring fans swarming back into stadiums. Britain’s love for sport was always deep but now we will see new heights of appreciation. But football, in particular, has stretched the public’s loyalty, with billionaire-owned Premier League clubs using the government’s furlough system to transfer staff wage costs to taxpayers. The cries of poverty emanating from many clubs and sports organisations have invited scrutiny around how they are run and where all the money goes.With Euro 2020, the Olympics, Wimbledon and The Open lost or postponed, the English sporting summer, a mainstay of our culture, has been wiped out. Another hundred days from now, in mid-July, cricket’s new smash-ball form, The Hundred, teeters as August and September become the best hopes for a resumption. The Hundred was meant to be cricket’s new goldmine but may not be seen until 2021.Football’s quandary is the most pressing. It hopes to complete the 2019-20 season before the next one can commence in August - or later - in large part to avoid paying rebates to broadcasters for uncompleted fixtures. Last season in the Premier League, Liverpool amassed 97 points but still fell short of the title, which they have not won for 30 years. This time they are 25 points clear with nine games left but are at the mercy of a microbe.Industry watchers predict a “bloodbath” as budgets are slashed and jobs cut. Sport’s complacent belief that the show would always go on has unravelled in the face of a pandemic - and even superstars have lost their omnipotence. Many will be feeling physically and mentally frazzled and will need time to regain their form.A country in need of life-affirming spectacles is desperate to see them back from their lockdowns. Yet the financial damage will take many years to correct. A return to the old ways of funnelling vast revenues to the performers and their agents with no structural underpinnings would show that lessons had not been learned.Hopes remain for live sport in July, or perhaps more realistically, August, but mass gatherings will be the last of the prohibitions eased by the government, so we may see sport proceed at first with turnstiles locked.One hundred days ago, Boris Johnson and the Conservative Party were still basking in the glory of an unexpectedly large election triumph. That victory came from a transformation of the party. A new Tory coalition was forged from disillusioned Labour voters in the Midlands, the North and Wales through a politics that was more Left-wing when it came to splashing the cash, but more Right-wing on key social issues such as immigration.Nowhere was the transformation more clear than at the new Chancellor, Rishi Sunak’s Budget, where he opened the spending taps for tens of billions on roads, rail and broadband.Yet that Budget also marked a turning point. Mr Sunak announced £60 billion of spending to battle the economic fallout of the Coronavirus pandemic. Within days he was announcing billions of pounds more. And more again a few days after that. By then, all other priorities were on hold.As for the next 100 days, several major questions hang over the Government. The most obvious and immediate is how and when to lift the lockdown. Ministers and their scientific advisers are juggling a number of factors. They know that collapsed businesses and raging unemployment could lead to health problems just as damaging as the epidemic itself. But move too soon, overwhelm the NHS and see death rates from any and all illnesses and accidents spike, and the economy would be in dire straits anyway.When it ends, the epidemic will have complicated significantly the long-term goals of the Tory Party. The pandemic creates serious problems for “levelling-up”. The cost of supporting the economy through the lockdown will have piled tens of billions onto the national debt. How much room will be left for infrastructure? And will the global economy be stalling or roaring back? That matters for the public finances, but also for the regions that the Tories want to boost. Regenerating post-industrial towns is hard enough without a global recession.But is there a case for optimism? The economic recovery, which many still hope will be swift and dramatic, could provide a significant chance to reorder the economy. The Government has a major task ahead in reaching net-zero emissions by 2050, but it could target the post-virus stimulus not only at lifting up the regions but at transforming public transport, energy production and housing in the process. Here’s hoping.As this lockdown continues, one thing has become apparent to most families in Britain: we need teachers.  On March 20, schools across the UK shut indefinitely to all but the children of key workers in order to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. In an unprecedented move, GCSE and A-level exams will not take place instead, GCSEs, AS and A-levels will be awarded in July based on mock data, inidual assessment and prior attainment. Many have questioned the accuracy of these, particularly for black and minority ethnic, working-class and other marginalised students. Students may also be allowed to sit exams early in the next academic year or in summer 2021.The next three and a half months will bring us up to the end of summer term. The Government has said it will assess the situation after Easter, but most educators in Britain are preparing for the likelihood that schools will remain closed through May and, most likely, through the end of the summer term. While a study released this week by University College London concluded that closing schools may not have a big impact on preventing the spread of Covid-19, most around the world remain shut.What does this mean for learning? On one hand, the British education system is sensibly repetitive. “Homes aren’t schools, and nor should they be,” notes Dr Dan O’Hare, an educational psychologist at the University of Bristol. “They worry is that children need a lot of ‘learning’ - but the curriculum is pretty repetitive and they’ll have covered it before, and will cover it again.”The greater loss during this period is social, says Dr O’Hare. Whether four or 14, children rely on classroom interactions to build and maintain the social skills that will carry them through life. Adolescent development relies on peer identity. To keep that skillset going, Dr O’Hare says social media, with parental supervision, can be a very positive tool.The provision of education at home during this period is deeply uneven, and the degree to which parents are able to lead home-learning has exposed deep isions: while some parents may be organising four hours of focused, supported study each day, others in the same school may be struggling to feed their children.Some educators have taken the cancellation of exams this year as a chance to reconsider the British education system. The UK is alone in Europe in assessing twice (at 16 and 18), and in offering such a narrow range of subjects at the final school assessment level (A-level). Even the inventor of the GCSE has called for them to be scrapped perhaps this period of reflection will allow educators to step back and re-prioritise the outcomes of our education system?Twelve years ago – the last time the global economy was brought to its knees – it was the banks that needed bailing out. This time it’s everyone else: borrowers, savers, renters, homeowners – and yes, even landlords.Politicians and regulators have made it very clear that Britain’s banking system must now repay its debt and support the taxpayers who, as a result of the 2008 crisis, endured austerity and a lost decade of wage growth while property prices took ownership out of the reach of many younger workers.Banks have fallen into line, agreeing various “holidays”, from mortgage payments to extortionate overdraft fees. It seems certain these will now be extended into the next 100 days.I’m afraid the real economic hit will not be fully revealed for some time yet. Currently furloughed workers are having 80 per cent of their wages (up to £2,500 a month) guaranteed by the Government. A much-needed safety net, but one that doesn’t do much to help employers who must stump up the cash today, and claim it back later. At best, this is keeping thousands of firms on life support. When that is withdrawn, we will see unemployment figures soar, in line with the truly terrifying figures coming out of America. It will be far, far worse than the financial crisis.If that does come to pass, payment holidays of all stripes will need to be extended – there’s no chance of unemployed people being able to meet repayments. Applications for Universal Credit, the main out of work and low-income benefit payment, have already surged. Expect another wave in June. Universal Credit has already been increased, to just under £100 a week, and may need to be raised again.Most at risk is Britain’s five million-strong self-employed army. While Rishi Sunak did (eventually) extend his bailout to people who work for themselves, millions are still missing out on any help whatsoever. By mid-summer, what little cash reserves the prudent have set aside may have been burnt through, and struggling businesses will have cut contractors and other third parties to control costs. Mr Sunak has all but confirmed the self-employed will have to pay him back with higher National Insurance costs in the future. Though he may be forced to backtrack, as former chancellor Phillip Hammond was, given this could be seen as a “tax on entrepreneurs”.The self-employed and anyone who fills out a tax return have had a reprieve on this year’s “payments on account”. This second tax deadline will now be due in January 2021, not July this year. More help may be forthcoming when the scale of the challenge facing the sector becomes apparent.  Students and parents of children at nurseries and fee-paying schools face a nervous wait. Will they get any refunds? So far, institutions are resisting particularly where they are offering online services. If the lockdown is still in place in 100 days they may be forced to offer refunds, even if that means they enter dire financial straits.Anyone with a big chunk of their assets in the stock market will be hurting – a lot. The FTSE 100 index of the biggest British companies has lost about a third of its value since the start of the year. Billions of idends have been cut, and will likely not resurface for years. Yet there is a growing case for arguing this is one of the best times in history to be investing. In three months’ time, brand-new investors or people putting their cash into markets now, might already be sitting on healthy profits. Pick the right stocks and in 20 years’ time, well you might just be a surprise entry to the ranks of Isa millionaires.A screenwriter I know claims he has never been so busy  – the film industry has in the last fortnight gone into overdrive, he says, looking for material to fill the gaps that will occur when the lockdown lifts, with every studio determined to be ahead of the game.The same is true throughout the arts. Having rolled out programmes of streamed content to ensure some continuity, the movers and shakers have knuckled down to the conference-call business of forward planning for the autumn and beyond.Not much is likely to happen before September. Glyndebourne still fondly hopes to reopen on 14 July, and at the time of writing the BBC Proms (theoretically kicking off on 17 July) hasn’t yet been canned. But the Edinburgh festival jamboree in August is off, and West End shows aren’t likely to reopen in a hurry when there will be scant traffic, either touristic or domestic.So the focus is now on shifting dates and contracts to counter the loss of short-term income and minimise unnecessary risks: expect the announcement of some extra-long panto runs, and a lot of performances of tried and tested hits such as Carmen, Swan Lake and A Midsummer Night’s Dream. ENO is replacing its autumn Coliseum season with 10 weeks of the musical Hairspray.The good news is that the Chancellor has been quick to recognise the sector’s needs and decent concessions have been made, even if the sums involved are hardly on the German scale of 50 billion euros. Gift Aid can now be claimed on tickets not refunded, and Arts Council England has relaxed National Lottery rules so that money that would otherwise have channeled to capital projects can be used for emergency aid to the arts instead, without cost to the Treasury or the taxpayer. Some extra grant will be necessary for museums not under the ACE umbrella – could its source lie in the £120 million currently allotted to the Brexit Festival of 2022?The biggest challenge facing the arts over the next 100 days is to predict how taste and demand will change as a result of the trauma of the crisis – quite apart from the effect that straitened incomes will have on people’s ability to pay for entertainment. But be in no doubt: the arts are highly resourceful, imaginative and upbeat - and they have an absolutely central role to play in the national recovery.In another world, Glasgow would be gearing up to host the international climate summit COP26 in July, the biggest moment for climate diplomacy since the Paris Agreement was reached in 2015.Its postponement until next year pauses desperately needed international cooperation to keep global warming at 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels.That might not be such a bad thing. You will be hard-pressed to find many observers who held out high hopes for the outcome of the summit.The talks will now take place in a changed world.What may turn out to be the greatest impact of the crisis is the overturning of many of the assumptions that underpin our consumption-based emissions. Do we need to fly to that conference, rather than join online? Can we all adjust to working from home more and limiting our car journeys?Meanwhile, it has reminded us of the value of the natural world. Suddenly, we are desperate for the restorative powers of the great outdoors, and the local wildlife has come out of hiding. The zoonotic origins of the disease may prompt a rethink about our relationship to wildlife and bioersity. China is under pressure to permanently ban wildlife markets, believed to be the source of the virus.Already we can see the benefit to the environment of our changed behaviour. Carbon emissions and air pollution have dipped during the shutdown China’s annual CO2 emissions are estimated to have fallen 18 per cent. Air travel is down more than half.Clearly, these cuts are unsustainable in the current mode and are likely to bounce back, as we have already seen in China, unless they are translated into long-term changes.Questions over how we will rebuild have rightly largely been put aside for the time being as the world focuses on saving lives and getting back to work. But in 100 days we will start to see more conversations about where we want to focus our resources and whether the post-Covid stimulus packages should be invested toward a greener world.The prospects for that are mixed, so far. The response in the US is likely to be decided in the November presidential election. Already Donald Trump has relaxed environmental requirements for the fossil fuel industry, citing the crisis.China has also relaxed some environmental regulations and early indicators suggest it has ramped up production in those areas of the country where the lockdown has eased.The EU has said it remains committed to its Green Deal, but there have been calls from Poland and the Czech Republic for it to be put on hold.The other big question for the next few weeks is what role will international cooperation play? Should we start to see a united front in the fight against this virus, it may reinforce the power of collaboration to face a common challenge. Again there, so far, the outlook is not rosy.For many, the anxiety set in slowly. As people washed their hands to the tune of Happy Birthday with one eye on the news, talk of mass death and draconian lockdowns started to fill our social media feeds. It sounded hysterical at first, but it wasn’t long before all our lives had changed beyond recognition. 100 days in, and our so-called “new normal” has left us with a mental health crisis which is gathering speed.It’s no surprise given how much has changed. We are now unable to see and touch our loved ones, even when they are dying. We don gloves and masks for the occasional nervous visit to the supermarket, we are at risk of being shouted at by police on our daily government-sanctioned hour of exercise, and we hover over our finances and food supplies with trepidation. All those little routines we never used to think about - the quiet building blocks for our resilience - shattered in a matter of weeks. Meanwhile, we live in fear of an invisible virus and obsess over symptoms lists.Public Health England’s guidance on how to cope with this brave new world includes maintaining contact with friends and family via the telephone, video calls or social media, keeping to a regular sleeping pattern, and focusing on a hobby. It’s perfectly sensible advice, but it can’t come close to addressing the damage this crisis is doing to our mental health.A recent Ipsos-MORI poll revealed 62 per cent of Britons were finding it harder to stay positive about the future in the face of the pandemic. Meanwhile 80 per cent of young people with a history of mental ill health have found their conditions have worsened since the crisis began. Distressing reports coming from Covid wards suggest there may be many frontline workers, survivors of the virus, and bereaved families requiring mental health support in the coming months.One hundred days in, we still don’t know when this will end, nor how, and it’s impossible to predict exactly where we might be 100 days from now. But while we can’t control what happens in the coming weeks and months, we can try to get a handle on how we react to all this. Mind, which was given a £5 million grant by the Government last week to administer to mental health charities around the country, advises that we all take extra steps to help combat anxiety during this period.Take a break from the news cycle maintain social contact stay hydrated, well fed, mentally stimulated and physically active keep taking your medication if you are on any (if you have a repeat prescription you might be able to order it by phone, online or using an app, and your GP can still have an appointment with you over the phone) and above all don’t leave it too long to seek help. Start by talking about how you feel with someone you trust. Start today.I don’t have to look far to find a picture of how exercise has changed over the past 100 days. As I write these words from the shed at the bottom of my garden, I can see my neighbour doing inverted press-ups, using TRX bands that he’s strung from the back of his house. Inside my own house, my partner and kids are learning ‘spidey squats’ with Joe Wicks on YouTube. Later, I’m hoping to nip out for an hour on my bike, to take advantage of the empty roads. On a weekday.The last time I checked, before coronavirus made its way to the UK, we were in the doldrums of February - a time of hibernation and cancelled gym subscriptions. Now, a few weeks later, it’s as though we’re back in the heady days of early January, intent on working off the excesses of Christmas. Exercise is everywhere and we’re not deterred by barriers from getting it. Yoga studio closed down? No problem: we’ll do a class over Zoom. London Marathon cancelled? Who cares: we’ll run it virtually. Gym doors shut? What you want is Wicks on the TV, or some TRX bands in your garden.The question for the next 100 days is simple: will we keep going? New Year, New You health kicks tend to slide into guilty deferrals (‘next year, new me’). So how resolute is this current trend?I have hope. All around us, exercise is being reframed as an expression of our freedom. When it’s the one thing you can do outside every day, going for a run or a ride feels less like a chore, more like something that’s actually quite fun. The lockdown might not be in place in 100 days\u0027 time, but perhaps the reminder that exercise makes us feel good, and it\u0027s freely (or easily) available to everyone, will stay in our minds?The gym industry is going to have to work out where it fits in this new, more egalitarian world of exercise. The traditional gym certainly won’t die - you’ll always have people who want to work out away from their own homes, and the hardcore bunnies who love the wrought iron atmosphere - but expect big chains to start competing for the online class space. And don’t be surprised if you see personal trainers trying their luck here either: online workouts offer a way for them to teach clients without having to pay rent or commission to a gym landlord. Embrace Zoom, and you might just find your weekly PT session dropping in price.For the nation’s backbone of small and medium-sized businesses, surviving the next 100 days will be an achievement in itself.  They are adaptable and resilient, but few businesses could emerge unscathed from the plunge in demand triggered by the coronavirus lockdown.From cheesecake makers in Preston to door-makers in Buckingham and car-parts makers in Worcester, erse businesses are facing the same stark question: How can you carry on, when the customers have disappeared?Added to the practical problems of poorly staff and looking after their own families, life in recent weeks has been a difficult haze for the millions of striving bosses in this crucial sector which supports 22m employees.Much of their energy since the national lockdown on March 23 has been spent trying to navigate the financial support put in place by the government - on hold with banks, haggling with landlords over rent holidays, deferring VAT payments, or talking to equally stressed suppliers.Only once those conversations have taken place and options are exhausted will it become clearer which businesses will make it through. Insolvency practitioners are braced for a wave of business once bosses work out where they stand.It\u0027s clear the government support will not solve all of businesses’ problems, even with the welcome improvements to the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme that were introduced at the start of April, and pressure on banks to lend.Many companies are reluctant to borrow given the uncertainty over how quickly demand will recover. Putting staff on government-funded paid leave is helping bosses avoid lay-offs, but doesn’t help those who still need workers to help re-right the business, but cannot afford to pay them.Given the shock to demand, there is stress on all sides, and no easy way out. Legal challenges loom between suppliers and customers, tenants and landlords. Radical solutions being floated -  such as getting stronger companies to take over struggling rivals or the government taking equity stakes - are likely to gain more traction.Yet the simple biggest help to many companies would be some clearer guidance about when lockdown might be lifted - for financial planning as much as a psychological boost to bosses thinking about throwing in the towel. Hence ministerial attempts to dodge questions about the exit strategy are exasperating.In the meantime, companies will need to adapt, and many are already doing so. Many are selling vouchers for when they re-open making use of back-up supply chains organised during preparations for a no-deal Brexit opening up new online sales channels or even putting resources at the use of the NHS.There is hope then, that July 18 will be marked by successes along with the inevitable defeats.As the world has ground to a halt, virtually all travel companies are facing an existential threat. March would normally have been an important month for advance bookings - airlines and operators rake in cash as people book ahead for their spring and summer holidays. Instead, the vast majority of flights have been grounded and the industry - from hotels to airlines - has spent the last five or six weeks trying to cope with a deluge of cancellations and requests for refunds.Without more help from the government or a sudden change in fortune, significant numbers seem certain to collapse under the financial strain. We are likely to end up with fewer travel agencies, tour operators and - probably -  airlines too. We may well see some big names go under.But the one thing which would help save the bulk of the industry is the main summer holiday season. As chance would have it, the next 100 days of Covid-19 will take us to July 18. That’s just before most schools are expected to break up for the summer - assuming they return in the meantime. It is peak time for nearly all holiday companies - the six weeks or so when they make their key revenues for the year.The prospect of a successful summer is now on a knife edge and depends on two things. First that lockdown is a success, not just in the UK but also in the key Mediterranean holiday destinations, and it can be relaxed sufficiently to allow international travel. And second, that people feel confident - and solvent - enough to take a foreign holiday. Given the chance, the travel trade will no doubt attempt to drive bookings by offering exceptionally good deals. Even so, they are likely to have a battle on their hands to win back custom.France seems likely to be one testing ground. Once restrictions are lifted, we may see the first shoots of recovery among British travellers taking their own cars across the Channel. But the recovery of air travel will be crucial. Some airlines - Jet2 for example - say they will start flying again on May 1. Ryanair and British Airways look more realistic in planning for a significant increase in services from June onwardsBritain’s biggest tour operator, TUI is allowing customers to postpone existing bookings made before the end of June. Clearly it is hopeful to be able to operate during those key months of July and August.In short, the timing looks incredibly tight. If we are to avoid a lost summer of foreign holidays and the decimation of the travel industry, the battle against Covid-19 needs to go seamlessly.The prospects for holidays in this country look more rosy, however. Assuming travel restrictions in the UK are lifted relatively soon, hotels, holiday cottages, camping and caravan sites should be well back on track by mid July. Given the pent up demand from a public driven stir-crazy by lockdown, this summer may be boom-time for British holidays.So far, coronavirus has frozen the housing market, begun a mass withdrawal of mortgage options and halted most major housebuilding projects. Buyers and sellers have been thrown into a painful limbo. And many have started to worry seriously about house prices.So what’s next? First, transactions are going to tank. The government has effectively banned house sales unless buyers and sellers are legally bound to go ahead. In some weeks in April and May, Capital Economics forecasts falls in mortgage approvals and transactions of more than 90 per cent year-on-year. This would match what happened in China during lockdown. Overall, across the next three months, the research firm expects a 70 per cent drop in sales compared to the same period in 2019. Sales are unlikely to resurge fast after lockdown has been lifted. Savills has based its predictions on an assumption that transactions will stay at as much as 40 per cent below their five year average until September. Estate agents’ commission books are going to take a nasty hit.But that is not the same as a house price crash. It is in fact possible that so few transactions will take place that there won’t be enough data to produce some house price indexes.When the lockdown lifts, some purchases that were put on hold will go ahead as previously planned, but everyone in the market will be newly cautious - buyers of getting into negative equity and vendors of under-selling. We will almost certainly be in a recession. Stock levels will be low, but some people will have to take price cuts and sell. Savills forecasts a short-term price drop of between 5 and 10 per cent.Still, the number of forced sellers should be low. The Government has made swift measures to protect jobs, earnings and home ownership. Airbnb landlords, who will have lost their cash flow with the collapse of the travel industry, will find themselves on a pressure point. In 100 days, we will have seen a mass influx of these properties first to the long-term lettings market, and then perhaps to sales. But far more home owners should be stable than in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Then, as with the crash in the early Nineties, the house price plunge followed a period of exponential growth. This time around, our market was not volatile but tentatively recovering from a low base. Many buyers who currently have transactions on hold haven’t thought about renegotiating because they had already got themselves, say, a 10 per cent discount. There isn’t the same cliff edge to fall off. Overall for 2020, both Capital Economics and Knight Frank forecast price falls of only 3 per cent, with recovery starting in 2021.This was meant to be the year Boris Johnson would get Brexit done on January 31, and dusted on December 31 by seeing the United Kingdom out of its transition period on time.The first part of the Prime Minister’s plan went off without a hitch, thanks to his election win helping him steamroller parliamentary opposition. But his hefty Commons majority has not been able to stop Covid-19 from throwing a ner in the works of the post-Brexit talks.After negotiators faced off in their first round of talks at the start of March, the UK and EU had to ert increasing amounts of money, manpower and attention to the raging pandemic rather than preparing for life fully outside of the bloc. Coronavirus soon made it unsafe for negotiators to meet in person, with Michel Barnier and his British counterpart David Frost having to lie low after showing symptoms of the disease.With negotiators reduced to a back and forth of emails and attempts to make the most with remote communication technology, progress has been glacial. Talks have little advanced from opening demands. But in less than 100 days, both sides have to decide if they want to extend the transition period in order to allow more time to negotiate their future relationship.Before coronavirus reared its ugly head, Boris Johnson threatened in February to ramp up preparations to leave without a deal unless negotiators made enough progress by June, nailing down key areas like fisheries and financial services. With the sufficient progress now nigh-on impossible, barring a last-minute erasure of red lines in a desperate grab for a deal, the Prime Minister will have to decide how ready he is to make good on that threat.Meanwhile, European politicians are piling pressure on him to seek a delay, knowing well how vehemently he ruled out such an idea.The UK Government insists for now that it will not budge in its refusal to string out negotiations, but even stalwart Brexiteers are bracing themselves privately for such a delay to be agreed. Expect it only to happen at the very last minute ahead of the July deadline, when it is beyond doubt how badly Covid-19 has disrupted everything.Coronavirus has already struck down the Prime Minister, UK and EU negotiators and any chance of both sides steaming towards a good deal by July. Mr Johnson will be fighting until the last minute not to have its cherished transition deadline enter its own “delay phase”.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"many people may already have immunity coronavirus german study","story":"Many more people may have been infected with coronavirus and acquired immunity than previously thought, according to a groundbreaking study in Germany.Scientists studying the town at the epicentre of the country\u0027s first major outbreak said they had found antibodies to the virus in people who had shown no symptoms and were not previously thought to have been infected.Initial results released on Thursday suggest that as many as 15 per cent of people in Gangelt, in Heinsberg district,  may already have immunity – three times as many as previous estimates.The findings suggest the mortality rate for the virus in Germany is just 0.37 per cent — five times lower than current estimates.This means a gradual relaxation of the lockdown is now possible, Prof Hendrik Streeck, the virologist leading the study, told a press conference. Because the people in Germany have been so careful and disciplined, we are now able to move on to the second phase.But Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, dashed hopes of an early end to the lockdown, saying: We must not be reckless now. We could very quickly destroy what we have achieved.The study in Gangelt is the first in Europe to research the effects of the virus on an entire community. Scientists from the University of Bonn are testing around 1,000 people from 400 households for antibodies as well as signs of current infection.Initial results, based on around half the tests, found two per cent of inhabitants are currently infected and 14 per cent had antibodies to the virus. Allowing for overlap, that suggests 15 per cent of people in the town now have immunity, compared to the previous estimate of five per cent.The 15 percent is not that far from the 60 per cent we need for herd immunity, Prof Gunther Hartmann, another of the study\u0027s leaders, said.With 60 to 70 per cent herd immunity, the virus will completely disappear from the population. Then the elderly are no longer at risk.The figures cannot be extrapolated to the rest of Germany because Gangelt had a higher rate of infection, but the study\u0027s authors said they were grounds for cautious optimism.  An immunity rate of 15 per cent is already enough to slow the spread of the virus significantly, they said in a joint statement.The findings suggest the mortality rate of the virus may be lower than previously thought. The study found a mortality rate of 0.37 per cent, compared to Johns Hopkins University\u0027s current estimate for Germany of 1.98 per cent.The study\u0027s authors said their findings could be closer to the real figure for the virus because they had detected so many previously unknown infections.The much lower mortality rate in Gangelt is explained by the fact this study is detecting all infected people, including those with no symptoms or very mild illness, they said.Antibody testing for the virus is still in its early stages. Chinese scientists released a study confirming they had detected antibodies for the first time  this week, but warned they were unable to detect any in some patients known to have been infected.It is unclear how long any immunity to the virus conferred by a previous infection will last, although experience with similar viruses suggests it will be in the range of a year to 18 months.I think the most important thing all governments can do to address the virus is to get reliable data, Prof Streeck, the study leader, told The . We don’t yet know enough about this virus.The authors said the findings were grounds to begin lifting the current general lockdown and move on to a phase of isolating the vulnerable groups most at risk.Jens Spahn, the German health minister, had earlier suggested an easing of the lockdown could be possible after Easter, saying:  We are seeing a positive trend, but it must continue. If it does, we will be able to talk… about a gradual return to normality after the Easter holidays.But Mrs Merkel appeared to play down hopes for an early easing of restrictions amid concerns people may be less disciplined about social distancing over the Easter holidays. I would like to be the first to tell you everything is as it was and we can go back to normal, but that’s not how it is, she said.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"air pollution drops drastically across uk annual global carbon","story":"Air pollution has fallen by up to 60 per cent in some cities in the UK since the start of the lockdown. Meanwhile global carbon dioxide emissions were predicted to fall 4 per cent this year, a historical drop, because of the slowing of air and road traffic and heavy industry.Levels of nitrogen dioxide, caused by road traffic, dropped significantly across the country after the government introduced a nationwide stay-at-home policy on March 24 and road traffic dropped by more than 70 per cent. Monitoring points in London, York, Bristol, Glasgow and Nottingham were among those which saw their levels of air pollution halved. The A472, in Hafodyrynys, Caerphilly, which regularly tops the list of most polluted spots in the country, saw its levels of NO2 drop 48 per cent according to the data from Defra, which was released by the BBC.Nitrogen dioxide impairs lung function, and particularly affects those with asthma. A similar story has been seen across the world, with clear skies reported in notoriously smoggy New Delhi and Beijing as cars and heavy industry grind to a halt. International air traffic has fallen by an estimated 40 per cent, and by 89 per cent over the UK.But experts have warned that the change is unlikely to be permanent, with areas of south-east China already seeing a return to regular levels of air pollution.A report from UK-based website Carbon Brief yesterday suggested global carbon emissions could fall by 1,600million tonnes, representing 4 per cent of the global total.The analysis looked at data from the global oil sector, the EU\u0027s carbon trading scheme, India’s electricity sector and the economies of the US and China, which it says accounts for 76 per cent of global CO2 emissions. But the report said even a cut of emissions on this scale would not be enough to limit global warming to internationally agreed levels, which would need to be at 6 per cent every year for the next ten years. “To put it another way, atmospheric carbon levels are expected to increase again this year, even if CO2 emissions cuts are greater still,” analyst Simon Evans wrote. “Rising CO2 concentrations – and related global warming – will only stabilise once annual emissions reach net-zero.”More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"did new york become coronavirus capital world","story":"New York has now become the coronavirus capital of the world, recording more cases than any country across the globe.As of Thursday, the state, which is home to some 19.5 million people, had recorded 159,937 Covid-19 cases - the highest subnational total.It has now surpassed the number of infected people in every country worldwide other than America itself, overtaking second-worst hit Spain, which has 152,446 cases, and Italy with 139,422. The US, as a whole, has 462,000. China, where the virus is widely thought to have originated, has so far tallied 81,865.Not only does it have the dubious honour of having the highest number of cases of any single place on Earth, the coronavirus is also claiming more lives here than almost anywhere else.New York has recorded more than 7,000 deaths in the 39 days since its first case was recorded in early March, accounting for nearly half the US total of 16,000. The number of coronavirus deaths in New York has eclipsed those in China, Iran and Germany.Total fatalities are now at 3,335 in China, 4,110 in Iran and 2,349 in Germany, the latest data shows.The country with the most fatalities so far from coronavirus is Italy with 17,669 deaths, followed by Spain with 15,238, according to the data.The city also looks to be on a steeper curve than Lombardy, Italy, which was considered the epicentre of the outbreak in March.New York is now regularly recording more daily deaths than Lombardy recorded at its height, but it has taken three fewer weeks to get there and is still rising.On Monday, it recorded 731 deaths in 24 hours, representing the highest single-day increase in the death toll since the crisis started. But the record was broken again on Tuesday, with 779 cases and yet again on Wednesday, which saw 799.Lombardy’s highest single-day death toll reached 919 in late March, but even at its height it did not regularly see numbers above 700.New York has also got here much quicker than Lombardy, which recorded its first cases long before its outbreak plateaued.In his briefing to the press on Thursday, Andrew Cuomo, New York’s Governor, however, pointed to the latest hospitalisation stats to suggest the worst might be behind them.Some 200 net new hospitalisations were tallied over 24 hours, the lowest number since the crisis broke out. That daily admission number had been as high as 1,400 just last week. Likewise, the rate of new intensive-care admissions and intubations -- when patients are put on a ventilator -- also plummeted.About 18,000 people in the state have been hospitalised with the virus. After early models predicted a wave as big as 135,000 coronavirus patients, New York nearly doubled its hospital capacity to about 90,000 beds.The new figures on the rate of hospitalisations suggest that the state will need far less hospital capacity than it now has.Mr Cuomo was cautious about showing too much optimism. “I don’t want to get into a retrospective when we’re in the middle of the game,” he told reporters. But added: “The expert models were all off.”Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that the apparent flattening of the infection curve might mean that the city could reach a second phase as early as June that would relax restrictions on movement outside the home.But this would require much more testing and a continued practice of social distancing.Some suggest the answer lies in the amount of testing New York has carried out.Sure, the state has been testing at a higher rate than almost anywhere else in the US, but it is still much lower per capita than in China, Germany, Italy and South Korea.Trump’s travel ban targeted the wrong countries, new study suggestsPart of the answer could lie in new research reported on Thursday.A series of studies suggested that one of the first strains of coronavirus to hit New York came from the UK and Europe, not China as suspected.It found that an early case of the virus in the city was in all likelihood indirectly transmitted by an inidual who brought it across from Britain.But while President Donald Trump barred foreign nations at the end of January from entering the US if they had been in China, it was not until mid-March that similar restrictions were placed on travellers from most European countries.In one example researchers at the Grossman School of Medicine traced the case of a Long Island resident with no travel history who tested positive for Covid-19 in early March.Dr Adriana Heguy, of the school’s Department of Pathology, found that the Long Island patient’s viral genome correlated with that of a strain circulating in Britain, suggesting the patient had contact with someone who had carried the virus from the UK.Scientists at Mount Sinai Hospital have also written a study indicating that coronavirus began to circulate in the New York area by mid-February, weeks before the first confirmed case, and that the travelers who brought in the virus did not arrive from Asia.The US initially limited testing only to people who had come from China in the two weeks before January 31 and displayed symptoms of Covid-19.Lockdown restrictions not strict enoughGov Cuomo took measures to close New York down, but the lockdown has not been anywhere near as austere as in cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, or indeed the hardest-hit parts of Europe.They were also taken much later than the aforementioned. New York ordered all schools closed by March 18, by which time it had already recorded thousands of cases. The city is one of the most densely populated areas of the country and for some it has been hard to isolate and practise social distancing.That spatial closeness makes us vulnerable, as Mr Cuomo put it.Pictures from subway stations in the poorest parts of the city, Queens and the Bronx, have shown crowded platforms. The rate of the spread of the infection in these boroughs - where people in lower-income jobs continue to leave the house for work - has left hospitals struggling to cope.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jealous shall young let loose rest us","story":"To all the other dizzying transformations caused by Covid-19, add this: the young may soon be the only people allowed out, while their parents are grounded indefinitely.A new research paper by economists and behavioural scientists at the University of Warwick argues that part of the population must be allowed to return to “normality” fairly soon if we are to avoid a catastrophic recession. The ideal cohort, they suggest, is people aged 20 to 30, so long as they are not living with their (more Covid-susceptible) parents.Young people, even if they catch the virus, are less likely to get seriously ill and require hospital treatment. They should therefore be released back into the wild to work and socialise and restart the economy.Well, someone has to go first, I suppose. But what a strange new world it will be with only youngsters in it. What will Generation Z do with all this freedom, all this unaccustomed power? When they get back to the office will they spin around in the boss’s chair, put their feet up on his desk, rummage through the pills and paper clips in his desk drawer? Will they listen obediently to their elders, trapped in our Zoom windows, squawking about strategy? Or will they – Heaven forbid – find they can get on perfectly well without us?My God, how jealous we will be. Every time a pair of smart shoes clacks along the pavement at a commuting hour every time a pub door opens again and a convivial roar escapes. It’s one thing to be part of a collective lockdown quite another to watch the young inherit the earth while we press our faces to the windowpane.Still, mustn’t grumble. The longer this lockdown goes on, the luckier I realise I am. Not just lucky – spoilt. I live in a nice house with a garden, three healthy children and a husband who (among his other excellent qualities) doesn’t beat me. If this were lockdown poker, I’d be holding the royal flush.On social media, I notice, many of my middle-class friends have fallen abruptly silent. They, like me, now realise they have nothing to complain about – and no appetite for boasting either. There are no snaps of restaurant food or holiday sunsets. No one wants to see your eclectic interior decor, let alone the rural idyll in which you may be self-isolating, and even wry self-deprecation falls on stony ground. So what if your feral children are covered in mud? You’re lucky to even have access to mud.It’s not just guilt that silences me: it’s also the surprising force of genuine gratitude. GK Chesterton once wrote that, as well as thanking God before every meal, “I say grace before the concert and the opera, and grace before the play and pantomime, and grace before I open a book, and grace before sketching, painting, swimming, fencing, boxing, walking, playing, dancing, and grace before I dip the pen in the ink.”I don’t believe in God, and I don’t know who to thank except luck and the class system. But the blessings of my life, big and small, have seldom seemed more vivid. When I’m playing swingball with the kids in our little patch of garden, with our washing flapping and dazzling in the spring sunshine, a sudden happiness seizes me which, I think, can only be called grace.The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

It will be published every day for five days on ‘Breathe it in’ reads the roadside signs welcoming visitors to Eastbourne. Retirees have long been enticed by the chalk-blue waters and bracing breeze of this south coast seaside town — England’s oldest, with a median age of 70.9-years-old. But in the age of Covid-19, that slogan has taken on an altogether more sinister air.Bill Watham and his wife, Ann, sit squarely in Eastbourne’s demographic bracket. Aged 70 and 69 respectively, both also have underlying health conditions which propel them to the top of the register of those deemed most at risk from the coronavirus.When the national lockdown was announced, the couple followed Government advice and holed up inside their red-brick semi on a quiet street in Eastbourne’s old town. Normally the pair, who don’t have a car, rely on online supermarket deliveries, but as panic buying ensued they weren’t able to secure a slot.Unable to leave home and with no family on hand to help, instead they resorted to eating whatever supplies they had left. When those had been used up, for five long days they survived only on porridge oats with water, and black tea.“We wouldn’t dream of asking anybody for help,” says Bill, a retired builder, standing a safe distance away at the threshold of his front door. Patting his stomach and trying to laugh away those frugal and frightening days, he estimates he lost 8lb in weight before help arrived. “Things happen in this world and you just get on with it,” he says. “That’s what we British do.”With Britain now on lockdown for the forseeable, today the  launches a new five-part series reporting on how we, as a nation, are coping. With coronavirus cases spreading out of the big cities and rising in the regions at a rapid rate, we are visiting towns and villages across the country as life changes beyond all recognition. As well as highlighting its tragic toll, we will be celebrating the stoicism of communities coming together in the face of the pandemic.Today marks 101 days since China first revealed to the World Health Organisation that a cluster of patients suffering from a mysterious pneumonia had been discovered in the city of Wuhan. Over the subsequent months, Covid-19 has spread at an astonishing rate, infecting more than 1.4m people across nearly every country on earth.The coronavirus washed up early on the south coast of Britain, in early February, with Brighton the first national cluster of infection. Eastbourne, roughly 20 miles along the coast, is deemed particularly vulnerable due to its elderly population and reliance on tourism.At the last count, there have been 95 known cases of coronavirus in East Sussex, and 14 deaths at East Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust hospitals, encompassing Eastbourne, Bexhill, Rye and St Leonards — though that figure does not include care homes, of which there are dozens in the town.The ramifications of the virus here will be profound. At the same time as its care industry and health facilities prepare to be pushed to the brink, Eastbourne’s tourist industry has collapsed.Sally and Andrew Kitchen are among those to lose their livelihoods overnight. The couple only took over the New Wilmington Hotel last July. A few weeks ago, the restaurant was declared best carvery in Eastbourne and Mother’s Day bookings flooded in. Then the lockdown was announced and, within 24 hours, three months of reservations evaporated.Sally, 48, says they have been forced to let 20 staff go and are waiting to hear back on an emergency loan requested under the terms of the government bail-out. “The potential revenue we’ve lost is huge,” she says.But in a matter of weeks, she and Andrew have managed to transform the business, using their suppliers and raiding the hotel chest freezers to provide emergency deliveries for the vulnerable, elderly and key workers across Eastbourne.Since setting up a fortnight ago, they have delivered to in excess of 100 customers — among them the Wathams. Bill grins as he recalls their first drop off after days of deprivation. “We had milk, jam and bananas,” he says. “All these things we took for granted have suddenly become such luxuries.”As I join Andrew Kitchen on his daily rounds, other grateful residents emerge from their homes to collect their boxes. Maggie and Rob Atkinson, both in their 70s, step tentatively outside their front door wearing marigolds and clutching antibacterial wipes to prevent any contamination.Before signing up to the deliveries, Maggie says, they had run so low on supplies that they had been forced to ration themselves to one piece of fruit and two slices of bread each a day.Another beneficiary is 90-year-old Barbara Granger, who has lived alone in her flat for the past 10 years. “Shopping has been a big problem for me because I don’t want to go to the supermarkets,” she says. “I very much appreciate the support.”Barbara is passing the lonely days of self-isolation reading and talking to family online. She will only turn the television on for the 1pm news, and again at 6pm. Last Sunday she, along with millions, watched the Queen’s speech. As someone whose formative teenage years were also spent during the Second World War, it resonated.“Then it was obviously a crisis, but also different because we knew who we were fighting,” she says. “I feel in a way this virus is more frightening than the war.”On the seafront, gentle waves lap the shingle beach and gulls wheel through the blue sky. The vista may remain unchanged, but any other semblance of normality has gone. The roads are largely deserted, though we spot several ambulances racing by.The council has – along with other local authorities - introduced restrictions on mourners attending funerals. One Eastbourne funeral director (who did not wish to be named) says he has already been required to handle the bodies of Covid victims while wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE).Care homes have closed their doors to visitors in an attempt to restrict the spread. Ian Turnbull, the manager of Sunrise Senior Living, says his care home’s 86 residents are on lockdown to all but essential visits. Even those on their deathbed are only allowed one family member by their side.Turnbull says the home has had several suspected cases, although they eventually transpired to be negative after testing by Public Health England. But he warns the testing system remains slow and inadequate. He has already heard of further suspected cases in other care homes in the town. “This is going to be a huge test for the care home sector,” he says.Earlier this week, Peter Kyle, the Labour MP for nearby Hove — which has about 30 care homes — said facilities were effectively being “converted into hospices” because of a lack of protective equipment and testing facilities. However Turnbull insists his staff have all the PPE they need.Georgina Kemp, 34, has spent 12 years working in the care sector in Eastbourne and is currently employed by the NHS, assisting with the physical rehabilitation of elderly patients in the community.In recent days, her role has been merged into an urgent crisis response unit. While Covid-19 has not yet engulfed the local hospitals and care homes to the extent of London, she says, they expect it to soon.“A lot of people are very scared,” she admits. For now, Eastbourne holds its breath.More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/family/2020/04/08/TELEMMGLPICT000228334483_2_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqg5ozdfdQpDHsa6AO6OAwnlabMGzIC_NZv763wN-vL4o.jpeg?imwidth","title":"resurrection christ shows can find light even present darkness","story":"A church parishioner watches a laptop inside Liverpool Parish Church (Our Lady and St Nicholas) in LiverpoolJesus’s victory over death tells us that we can have hope even in the face of unimaginable sorrowOne night, in 1499, the young Michelangelo, aged only 23, broke into the Chapel of Santa Petronilla and chiselled into his first masterpiece the words, “Michelangelo Buonarroti, Florentine, made this”.The masterpiece is, of course, the Pietà. He made this addition after hearing it said that a rival sculptor, Cristoforo Salari, was widely believed to be its creator, since Michelangelo himself was considered too young to have produced such a remarkable work of art. He later regretted his outburst of pride and never again added a personal signature to any piece of his work.The Pietà belongs to Good Friday. It depicts, with utter tenderness, the moment when the dead body of Jesus, taken down from the cross of his execution, is laid in the arms of Mary, his mother.The Pietà is a powerful image for all of us today, as we follow, with mounting dread, the daily roll-call of the number of people who have succumbed to death, attributed to the vicious work of the coronavirus. I cannot remember a time when such gruesome statistics were the headline of every news bulletin.The Pietà is an image of profound tragedy and sorrow. It speaks to the heartbreak of mothers in every time and place. Yet it does not match the sharpest of sorrow among us today.Today, mothers, daughters, sons and even the closest of friends are not able to embrace or even touch their loved ones in that final journey into death. They cannot care for their bodies. They must stand back from their lost one, and distance themselves even from each other, as the body is brought to its final resting place. What sorrow can compare with this? What scars this will leave, burdens to be carried for years to come.The eyes of faith struggle to pierce this darkness. If we are to cling to hope in this saddest of times, we need to follow closely in the footsteps of Jesus. He alone breaks through this darkness. He does so only because he is the Son of God, the Creator. If this is not so, then he, too, is helpless before the brutality of death.As God he conquers. Yet he is also one of us, fully one of our flesh. Without this human nature of Jesus, his victory would remain out of our reach. But, as wholly one of us, his victory is shared with his brothers and sisters, offered to the whole of our human family.The footsteps of Jesus that we follow today bring us to his death. Yet there are more, unseen footsteps that lead us further on. Only by following them do we come to realise the fullness of the victory he brings.From its beginnings, the Christian creed has proclaimed that after his death and before his appearances to his disciples, the victorious Jesus “descended into hell”. He entered the realms of every extreme darkness, bearing the cross, the weapon by which he had won victory. By means of his cross he broke open the tomb of death. Now he carries this cross, not to Golgotha, but into the presence of every forgotten soul and broken spirit. By the power of the cross, wielded by him as God, he belittles the death that defeats each of us.To us, his brothers and sisters, in every time and place, Jesus proclaims, “Arise O sleeper and rise from the dead and Christ will give you light!”The images of today are powerful: death coming in slow suffocation an inconsolable mother embracing her dead son the shattering of a dream and of a company of friends. The onset of total darkness. Such a day hardly deserves the title of Good Friday.Yet when we follow the invisible footsteps taken by Jesus after that cruel death, then a crack of light begins to open before us.This death is not the end this mother will receive her consolation this cross becomes the weapon of victory, breaking open the tomb and leading all who have died, reaching out for mercy in a triumphal procession. In this ine light, today becomes Good Friday.May this light uphold us in our dismay and guide us in our every word and deed.Cardinal Nichols is Archbishop of Westminster and author of The Glory of the Cross, published by SPCK and available on AmazonThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

Downing Street offered the Government\u0027s full backing to police forces seeking to enforce the restrictions over the holiday period.But there was a rebuke for Northamptonshire Chief Constable Nick Adderley after he suggested his force could mount road blocks and search shopping trolleys to check if people were going out to buy non-essential items.Home Secretary Priti Patel told talkRADIO: That is not appropriate, let me be clear on that. That is not the guidance.The Health Secretary, who has himself recently recovered from coronavirus, warned: “If you don\u0027t want us to have to take the step to ban exercise of all forms outside of your own home then you\u0027ve got to follow the rules”. But how likely is it that the government will take this extreme step?Despite the warnings, Housing and Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has confirmed there are no imminent plans to ramp up social distancing restrictions.Mr Jenrick has advised parks should remain open unless it was impossible to maintain social distancing. He also confirmed he had spoken to some local councils.This is their decision, but I have asked them to be very judicious in taking that step and only to do that where they feel it is impossible to maintain social distancing rules within their parks or open spaces, he told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme.The minister also expressed his sympathies to those who relied on public parks as their only source of greenery. “It would be very unfortunate if we had to do so and make it harder for people, particularly people who live in flats in towns and cities, to get the exercise they deserve”. Mr Jenrick’s sentiments were shared by Councillor Gerald Vernon-Jackson chairman of the Local Government Association\u0027s culture, tourism and sport board. Police patrol Clissold Park in Stoke Newington to enforce the coronavirus lockdown.Councils know that parks are a lifeline for residents needing to get some exercise or fresh air and are great for physical and mental wellbeing.This is why councils want to keep parks open, but people need to follow the social distancing advice, otherwise councils will be reluctantly forced to close them as a last resort to help prevent the coronavirus spreading.While this weekend has seen the police ramp up their presence, senior police officers have called into question the practicality of enforcing a ban on outdoor exercise. Jayne Meir, Assistant Chief Constable of West Midlands Police, told the BBC’s Radio 4 Today programme: I can understand people are looking at further restrictions. It would be really difficult to police iniduals on a daily basis. Everybody has to take personal responsibility for this. It’s a collective responsibility to stay at home.As for now, the guidance remains unchanged  - exercise once a day, with members of your household and within areas local to you. Read more: How long do lockdowns last? Countries which acted fastest could be freed firstBelow are questions on the lockdown from our readers that the \u0027s Front Bench Editor, Daniel Capurro, has answered. Our next Q\u0026ampA will be on shopping and consumer rights and will take place at 1 p.m. on Monday. Send in your queries to yourstory@telegraph.Apologies to those of you who did not get an answer today. Our next Q\u0026ampA will be at 1 p.m. on Monday and our Consumer Champion Katie Morley will be on hand to answer all of your question on shopping and consumer rights during the coronavirus crisis. Get your questions in for Katie by sending them to yourstory@telegraph. Here\u0027s our final question for today: I have been isolating for three weeks and so has my elderly mother (74). We are both fit and well and neither of us has developed or experienced symptoms of Covid-19 during the three weeks. I am worried about my mother\u0027s long term mental health and so wondered if I can go and live with her (with appropriate social distancing) for the next few months without putting her at risk? Could either of us be asymptomatic carriers?You should not be moving around during the lockdown and there is no way of knowing if you are an asymptomatic carrier without being tested. Also bear in mind that, were you to live with your mother, you would still have to keep your distance from her and limit the amount of time you spent in the same room. The Government guidelines on what to do if you live with a vulnerable person can be found here.Right, we\u0027ve got time for two more. Here\u0027s our penultimate question: A reader emails to ask: Can I drive to pick my son up from uni, about 120 miles away? Would it be safer than him travelling by train?Dan: No. If your son can take public transport then driving is not an essential journey. In fact, if your son has somewhere to live at university then he should not be travelling home anyway.Another anonymous one now. A reader says: I own a property which I ordinarily  rent out long term. It is about 4 miles from my home. My tenants vacated 6 months ago and I have not been able to relet so am trying to sell. My insurance conditions state I must check the property once a week. Is that a necessary journey?Dan: You should speak to your insurer to find out if an exception can or has already been made for the lockdown. The situation you describe is not specifically included in the Government guidelines as a reason to travel.A very tricky scenario here for one  reader. Jonathan Crookes says: Three weeks ago my father in-law passed away in Scotland. Needing to attend the funeral, my wife and youngest daughter (two-years-old) travelled by train to the Highlands. Along with our eldest daughter (six-years-old) who still needed to attend school, I remained in Yorkshire to go to work.My wife had intended on staying a few days to attend to family matters before returning by train. But then the lockdown happened. For the last two weeks our family remains separated: My wife and youngest daughter staying with family in Scotland while I am with my eldest daughter at our family home. We’ve been diligently following the Government’s instructions but I think this is a valid case for travel, to bring my wife and daughter home and reunite the family. Are we allowed to travel to Scotland to collect my wife and daughter, and return straight to home?Here\u0027s what Dan has to say:That is a very difficult situation with no easy answer. If your family does travel back, they or your whole household consider self-isolating for two weeks once they arrive, to reduce the risk that they have brought the virus back with them. The Government is aware that they cannot issue guidelines for every single situation and they have said that, for example, children of separated parents can move between households. My main suggestion, however, is that you reconsider your aversion to public transport. By travelling there yourself, you are doubling the number of journeys being made and exposing yourself more. A concerned neighbour emails us to ask: Can my neighbour\u0027s have building work done still with two builders working on the job or are they not following the government\u0027s rules still ?From Dan: Yes. The Government does not want the construction industry to grind to a halt and the Business Secretary, Alok Sharma, has written to construction companies to make clear that their workers can continue to travel to work.It\u0027s our second fishing question of the day but there\u0027s a different answer for this one given the context.Brian Paterson says: Fly fishing is a solitary pastime. Am I allowed to partake of this as part of my exercise regime? I have to drive half an hour to get to the river but once there, I will not see any other people.Dan: No. It is not exercise and you have to drive to get there. The Government has been clear that it does not want people to drive anywhere to spend time outdoors. Issy List asks: Does going out solo on my kayak count as the one form of exercise a day? My house backs on to a broad and I am able to launch my kayak from here. Bearing in mind the broad is likely to be quiet (most boat hire centres are closed and tourists are restricted) and I can easily distance myself from other water users, is it acceptable for me to go out on my kayak? Here\u0027s what Dan has to say: British Canoeing has said that it “strongly recommends that all paddlesport activity should cease on rivers, waterways and coastal areas until further notice.” By the sounds of it, you are able to paddle without breaching any guidelines, but bear in mind the risk that you may have an accident and need medical treatment.Duncan Goodwin emails to say: A lot of allotment holders are over 70 but otherwise reasonably fit. Across the UK we grow huge amount of food for our families and friends and this is the time of year that we have to prepare the soil and set seeds for the year ahead.1. Is work on an allotment classified as exercise provided we maintain the recommended social distancing? 2. An hour a day probably is not enough this time of the year. Can we allotment holders be classified as food producers and ,so, for the next month or so, be able to do the odd half day? It\u0027s a good effort, Duncan, but I just don\u0027t think that\u0027s going to fly. Dan says: You can visit your allotment for your exercise, but you are not classified as food producers and there is no shortage of fresh fruit or vegetables in UK shops. The Government has not specified a time limit, although one hour has been suggested as a sensible amount of time. reader Jan Richards says: I have a large allotment on a very rural plot without close neighbours. In \u0027normal\u0027 circumstances, there are rarely more than a dozen of us present at the same time, spread broadly with at least 10 metres between each other.Providing we take precautions, such as wearing disposable gloves when opening and closing the single gate, for example... can I continue to go up there as my form of daily exercise?Dan says: Michael Gove has said that people can visit their allotment for their daily exercise. However, you should not be travelling for your exercise and must respect social distancing rules.There\u0027s no Wimbledon this year but are you allowed to play your own bit of tennis?Keen tennis player Michael Wiltshire says: My wife and I are both keen tennis players, so our question is whether members of the same household would be permitted to play tennis?  All the guidance relates to contact with people outside one’s own household so that any infection is not spread, but me playing singles with my wife, using our own balls and not entering the (closed) clubhouse, does not violate any of the guidelines, and does constitute an excellent form of exercise. I\u0027m sorry, Michael. It\u0027s not good news.Dan says: No. The Lawn Tennis Association has ordered the closure of all tennis courts, saying in a statement that “ all tennis facilities and courts should be closed, and tennis coaching and activity should be put on hold with immediate effect.” Tennis has also been judged a social gathering under the Government’s guidelines.Via email, Andrew Knight asks: With the current lockdown due to coronavirus it is said we are still able to go out walking, exercising alone or with someone you live with is this correct? Where would we stand with going fishing to a river.There will be no socialising involved, just me and my son fresh air and a couple hours fishing?And here\u0027s Dan\u0027s verdict on the great fishing debate: You are permitted to be outside with members of your household, that is correct. However, you should not be travelling for exercise. If the river is a short walk away, then you may be ok to visit it, but not if you need to drive. That being said, fishing is not considered exercise and were you to be found by police, they would likely move you on.This is a popular one that we get asked almost every day.  reader Lesley Cahill says: With current government guidance allowing one form of exercise outside the home each day, is it permitted to leave home again on the same day for grocery shopping?I\u0027m currently taking our dogs for a walk each day, observing social distancing, but then a couple of times a week I\u0027m also driving (on my own I should add) to our local supermarket for shopping. Is this permissible? Dan: Yes, that is fine. The once a day limit applies to dog walks and exercise, while shopping trips should be kept as infrequent as possible.From Andrew Marshall: For many years there has been talk of a growing obesity crisis, the need to have fresh fruit and vegetables combined with daily exercise. Whilst the virus is impacting on normal life many garden centres are now closed with substantial numbers of plants and stock having to be destroyed: all at the time that many with gardens or allotments are starting to plant for the future harvest. This will also give the kids sat on their computers something to do over the next few weeks.The social distancing that is operating with supermarkets and food stores should be extended to garden centres. Not only will this save many businesses but also cover the items mentioned above.Could garden centres and allotments be reopened soon?Dan says: Garden centres are able to operate online and you can read our guide on how best to shop for gardening here. However, people should not be travelling to allotments. Time outdoors can be adequately sought in local parks or in private gardens, while fresh fruit and vegetables are readily available at supermarket.Another interesting one here looking at the idea of tighter restrictions.Daniel Valerio says: Are unnecessary jobs that you can’t do at home such as manufacturing or electronic goods warehouses going to close? Most of these places are still open and don’t intend to close with hundreds of people working everyday with very little safety measures, most of them are just not possible to follow the safety measures because of the amount of people that they have working.Dan: Unless the epidemic worsens or fails to decline under current measures, that is unlikely. The Government wants to keep as much of the economy running as possible, because unemployment and loss of wages are associated with long term health damage and a poorer country means a worse NHS. Alok Sharma, the Business Secretary, has made it clear that businesses can continue to remain open, even if they cannot meet full social distancing criteria, if they are not on the list of closed businesses and work cannot be done from home.It\u0027s the million dollar question!  reader Susannah Price says: I am extremely grateful that I am able to enjoy running outside, and I would hate to lose this freedom. I realise it is imperative that runners social distance themselves from others when running.But do you think running, alone or with members of your household, will be banned?Dan is cautious by he does have some good news for you, Susannah:The Government is very reluctant to limit people’s access to the outdoors. This is because they understand the importance of being able to exercise outside and worry that if measures are too extreme they could lead to a rebellion. That being said, if people fail to comply with the existing measures andor the virus continues to spread, it may become necessary.  The early signs, though, are that the current lockdown is having an effect.Another interesting one here via email. George Morris says: I am 79 and could be subject to various forms of restraint for 18 months. I am quite happy with this (I don\u0027t want to die) but would like to be allowed a short drive to somewhere remote so as to vary my daily cycle ride. Even better would be to be allowed to sail my boat. But the quite fatuous argument that I might have an accident and put additional strain on the emergency services has taken hold. Cycling (which is allowed) is far more likely to  finish up in A\u0026ampE than a short drive into the country in a car or an hour\u0027s row round the bay in a boat. And far more dangerous than either is prolonged confinement to one\u0027s own home, the most dangerous place of all. Could short drives to remote locations be allowed?Dan says: The Government has been quite clear that, if possible, you must get your exercise near home. Wanting variety in your cycling is not a reason to drive somewhere. Our first question comes from Jane Hewitt via email. Jane says: Some people are taking walks or cycle rides covering quite a few miles, if this is the case, could someone like me take one shorter walk and one longer walk, but use the longer walk to buy essentials each day for six days? Here\u0027s what Dan Capurro, the editor of the \u0027s Front Bench Newsletter, has to say: What other people choose to do should not impact whether you follow the rules or not. You should only leave the house once a day to exercise and, as infrequently as possible, to buy essentials. There is no specified distance or time, that is left up to iniduals, but the objective of the rules is to minimise your time outside your own home and your interactions with other people.Afternoon all! We\u0027re back and ready to do it all over again. Today\u0027s Q\u0026ampA is on all things lockdown and will be kicking off shortly.

Scientists believe the disease jumped into humans from one of the creatures at Wuhan Market.The second type ‘B’ - which is most common in mainland China - is derived from ‘A’, and separated by two mutations, while ‘C’ is in turn a ‘daughter’ of ‘B’.But interestingly it is type ‘C’ that initially infected Britain and Europe and that variant is not found in mainland China at all. In fact, it is most common in Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea suggesting that it spread to Europe from those regions. One English case also came directly from Australia.Geneticist Dr Peter Forster, the lead author from the University of Cambridge, said: “You have the ‘C’ type, which is not directly from China associated with Singapore and offshore East Asia and that’s where English cases come from. We know of an engineer visiting a Singapore conference and then returning via a chalet in The Alps, so that comes up in the network.“We usually use this analysis in tracing prehistoric human migrations, to allow you to see when they left Africa and populated the rest of the world, but nobody had thought to use it with a virus.“The viral network we have detailed is a snapshot of the early stages of an epidemic, before the evolutionary paths of Covid-19 become obscured by vast numbers of mutations. It’s like catching an incipient supernova in the act.”The technique has confirmed the importance of known infection routes, such as businessman Steve Walsh - the 53-year-old Brighton super-spreader who travelled to Britain from Singapore via The Alps in early February.Surprisingly, it appears that the countries who now seem to be doing the best at controlling the spread of the virus inside their own borders, are the ones from which the disease spread initially.Both Singapore and Hong Kong are yet to have a localised pandemic and are hopeful one might not happen. They have achieved containment through rigorous testing, contact tracing and localised quarantines. Likewise, despite recording more than 110,000 cases, Germany has seen just 2,349 deaths. But the new study shows that Singapore and Germany may have sparked the devastating outbreak in Italy, which has since spread to Britain.The analysis suggests that one of the earliest introductions of the virus into Italy came via the first documented German infection on January 27, and that another early Italian infection route was related to a “Singapore cluster”.Cases in Mexico, also appear to have spread from Italy, and in turn from the first German cluster in Munich - known as the Webasto case - which until now was believed to have been contained by German quarantine measures.After the first wave of infections from east Asia in Britain, a large number of new cases were imported by people who had been to ski resorts in Northern Italy during the half-term break. Northern Italy appears to have also been initially seeded by the German cluster.In contrast to Europe, the initial US outbreaks were of the ancestral ‘A’ variant.  Mutated versions of ‘A’ were seen in Americans reported to have lived in Wuhan, and a large number of A-type viruses were found in patients from the US and Australia.The A strain is largely absent across the Atlantic.The team used data from 160 virus genomes sampled from across the world between 24 December 2019 and 4 March 2020. Further work that has not yet been peer-reviewed using the analysis, suggests that the first infection occurred in humans somewhere between mid-September and early December. The research also shows that mutations in the virus appear to have sped up as it swept across the globe. The major Wuhan ‘B’ strain has not mutated much, which could mean it is immunologically or environmentally adapted to a large section of the East Asian population. In contrast, the other types appear to have speeded up the mutation rate, perhaps to adapt to changing populations.“If the virus wishes to infect someone from the US or Europe, these people have a different immunological response so you have predominantly type A and the English C type, so these are potentially to evade the immune response,” he said.“If you are in a very localised part of China then will meet with a homogeneous population who have come through a similar disease progression, but once you get outside then Europeans have gone through a different disease history and also possibly there is a more erse genetically erse population, so you get more mutations.”The team is keen to find out if certain strains are more aggressive than others, which could explain why some countries have much lower death rates. However researchers are struggling because countries like Spain and Germany have only sequenced a few dozen virus genomes and Italy fewer than 10.Dr Forster added: At the moment there are no clinical outcomes associated with the genomic sequences so we don’t know if the mutations are making some variants more lethal.“Phylogenetic network analysis has the potential to help identify undocumented COVID-19 infection sources, which can then be quarantined to contain further spread of the disease worldwide,” added Dr Forster.The study was published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). More from NewsMore from The We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/04/10/15/apollo13.jpg","title":"apollo 13 nasa anniversary moon what happened explained","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Mission is remembered as perhaps Nasa\u0027s finest, and most desparate, hourExactly 50 years ago, Apollo 13 set off from Earth and for the Moon. Just a couple of days later came a blast and the words that would shock and fascinate the world:\u0026nbspOK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here.Nasa is marking the anniversary of the mission it refers to as a successful failure, which represents one of its most high-profile disasters and its most famous miracles. It is a part of space history that is celebrated even today, with the story of the mission continuing to captivate the world.It was 11 April\u0026nbspthat marked the day the astronauts blasted off on their way to the Moon, and 13 April that an oxygen tank explosion started the mission to save the astronauts from being stuck in space.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn 17 April, nearly exactly six days after the mission began, the astronauts fell back through the Earth\u0027s atmsosphere and arrived safely back on Earth. It was an unlikely end to an unlucky mission.While it is now remembered as one of the most important moments in Nasa\u0027s history, the mission began in relative obscurity for a trip to the Moon. Apollo 11 had already managed to get to the lunar surface, and so what just a couple of years before was regarded as a near-impossibility was by that time relatively unexciting.Astronauts on screen from The Right Stuff to Apollo 13 and GravityBut hours later, television stations around the world were giving rolling updates on the mission\u0027s status, following closely as the astronauts and Nasa engineers back on Earth tried to save them from disaster.As well as being a relatively unwatched mission, the first couple of days of the journey were almost tediously straightforward. After two days of flight, one of the Nasa staff in mission control joked the astronauts that the spacecraft was in such good shape that they were bored to tears.Problems began on Apollo 13 when the astronauts were nearing the Moon and heard a bang and felt a shudder through their spacecraft. During what should have been a routine stir, one of the oxygen tanks on the spacecraft had burst and exploded.(After the mission was over, the explosion was traced back to overheating while the spacecraft was being tested on the ground, but there was no way to know that at the time.)The explosion also knocked out the fuel cells that should have been powering the spacecraft, and sent voltage in its circuits plunging. Engineers watching the mission from Mission Control saw the pressure in the damaged oxygen tank drop instantly.OK, Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem here, said\u0026nbspJack\u0026nbspSwigert, the command module pilot who had actually joined the mission as a last-minute substitute for a colleague who had become sick just before the mission took off.Houston, we\u0027ve had a problem, said Jim Lovell, the commander of Apollo 13.Almost immediately, it became clear that the astronauts would not be landing on the Moon, as planned. But that was a relatively unimportant challenge compared with the more pressing job of staying alive.In many ways, the explosion happened at the best possible time, and the astronauts would later say they considered themselves lucky. If it had happened earlier, they would have run out of power later, and the blast could have happened in lunar orbit or on the surface of the Moon.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

It would require them to slingshot around the Moon – coming frustratingly close to the surface they were supposed to land on – and then whip back around and float back home to Earth.In the meantime, mission control got to work putting together a rescue plan while the astronauts on board attempted to put out of their mind just how likely it was they would now die in space, something they say they never discussed.Flight controllers told the astronauts to shut down their command module and climb into Aquarius. That module was supposed to be the box that took the astronauts down to the lunar surface – but was refashioned into a lifeboat in an attempt to conserve power.Because it was never meant for so many people for so long, the lander was low on space. It was also filled with carbon dioxide, as the astronauts breathed inside their new, tiny spacecraft.One of the most famous breakthroughs came as engineers tried to find a way to fix that problem, by using the air purifiers from the now abandoned capsule in the lander. The two were the wrong shape to fit together – they were literally trying to fit a square canister into a round hole – but engineers back on Earth came up with a way of using various pieces of spacecraft to push the two together.Even once that was fixed, conditions inside the lander were miserable, without the energy for heating or other improvements to their conditions. They were stuck inside of a frigid box that was never meant to hold them, stuck\u0026nbspfor days with little to do but wait and see if the various last-minute solutions to their desperate situation would actually work.(The astronauts have said they didn\u0027t argue during this time, despite the miserable conditions, and didn\u0027t talk about the possibility of getting stuck floating in space and waiting to die either Lovell wrote in his autobiography that they were too busy struggling for survival. He also denied that they had poison pills hidden away in case of becoming lost.)Eventually they arrived back near home for what is traditionally one of the most perilous parts of the journey: dropping back through Earth\u0027s atmosphere to come home. They had enough power to switch on the command module and wait as they went through the gruelling, hot ordeal of slamming back down to Earth.As they did, the communications blackout that comes from the extreme conditions of the Earth\u0027s atmosphere lingered for much longer than usual, leaving flight controllers in the dark as to whether the three astronauts and their hacked-together spacecraft had survived.But eventually they appeared in the air, the spacecraft being cradled by three parachutes as it fell through the sky and down to Earth. They were picked up and all three completed a journey whose legacy – one of inventiveness and luck that became mission control\u0027s greatest achievement – is still celebrated by Nasa today.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

think about what you are putting online, and who could potentially see this information.Over time this adds up, and you may find that you have placed much more information about yourself online than you first thought.It comes amid a spate of scams linked to the pandemic, as criminals seek to capitalise on people\u0027s fears.Created with Sketch.Coronavirus culture from rooftops, windows and balconies Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeA rose is delivered by drone to a woman on Mother\u0027s Day in Jounieh, LebanonWomen dance on their balcony as a radio station plays music for a flash mob to raise spirits in RomeA skeleton stands on a balcony in Frankfurt, GermanyThe film Le ragazze di Piazza di Spagna is projected on a building in RomeA woman uses a basket tied to a rope to pull a delivery of groceries up to her balcony in Naples, ItalyDJ Francesco Cellini plays for his neighbours from the rooftop terrace of his flat block in RomeA woman gestures from her balcony in BarcelonaCellist Karina Nunez performs for her neighbours at the balcony of her flat in Panama CityDJ Nash Petrovic live streams a set from his roof in BrooklynPeople applaud medical workers from their balconies in Modiin, IsraelA Brooklyn resident relaxes in a hammock hung on their balconyResidents toast during a safe distance aperitif time between neighbours in Anderlecht, BelgiumMusician Adam Moser plays for neighbours from his balcony in Budapest, HungaryA man and his son on their balcony in BrooklynA man sits alone on a roof terrace in RomeFake food shopping vouchers and a bogus text telling iniduals they have been fined for going out during lockdown are among them.The Covid-19 pandemic has led to a surge in all kinds of scams, ranging from the doorstep to email, telephone and social media and everyone should be extra cautious of what they communicate online at this unprecedented time, added Leon Livermore, chief executive of the CTSI.Additional reporting by agenciesBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We need to persevere and we need to maintain our discipline and resolve.The restrictions we introduced two weeks ago were set to expire on Sunday.Today, the expert recommendation is to extend them for further three weeks until Tuesday May 5.The Government has accepted this recommendation.\u0026nbspCostume-makers swap Downton and Star Wars for hospital scrubsBritish costume-makers who normally dress actors in shows including Downton Abbey and\u0026nbspGame of Thrones\u0026nbsphave joined forces to make scrubs for medics fighting the coronavirus outbreak.Working from kitchens, sheds and attics across the country, the team of 150\u0026nbspis churning out uniforms for returning medics and clinicians who do not normally wear them.Dulcie Scott, who most recently made couture dresses for Ruth Wilson in the BBC\u0027s adaptation of Philip Pullman\u0027s His Dark Materials, is helping lead the effort alongside a material buyer who once worked on a medical drama.She told Reuters:\u0026nbspIt went way beyond anything I could have imagined.We have the most phenomenal, world-class network of costume-makers helping us.The\u0026nbspgroup, which is calling itself Helping Dress Medics, launched a fundraising appeal\u0026nbspfor £1,500 pounds to source materials and two weeks on\u0026nbsphas raised more than £44,000. They now have\u0026nbsp6,000 sets of scrubs in production.A curtain-maker has donated fabric, while the bosses of factories forced shut by the outbreak are working to cut the material.It feels brilliant and restores my faith in people and I think this is wonderful, Scott said. But also it\u0027s quite heartbreaking when you see what a need there is.Johnson will feel like he\u0027s been \u0027hit by several buses\u0027Boris Johnson is likely to feel as if he has been hit by\u0026nbspseveral\u0026nbspbuses and will need time to recover from Covid-19, a virologist has said.Becoming ill enough to warrant a stay in intensive care leaves a patient weak and exhausted for a significant period of time, said Dr Chris Smith of the University of Cambridge.However, as the PM is not elderly,\u0026nbspis in good health, and did not require a ventilator he is likely to be able to bounce back more quickly, Dr Smith said.He added: It\u0027ll still be a few weeks before he\u0027s feeling like his old self though.War-ravaged Yemen confirms first coronavirus caseYemen has reported its first case of the\u0026nbspcoronavirus, raising fears of a catastrophe in a country where war has shattered health systems and spread hunger and disease.A 60-year-old Yemeni man was diagnosed in the southern oil-producing region of Hadhramout, an area controlled by Yemen\u0027s internationally recognised government, the supreme national emergency committee said.Spokesman Ali al-Walidi told a news conference the patient, who works in the small port of Ash Shihr, was in stable condition at a quarantine centre.A widespread\u0026nbspoutbreak of Covid-19\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspwould be catastrophic in Yemen\u0026nbspas the health status of at least half the population is very degraded and the country does not have sufficient supplies or facilities, UN\u0026nbsphumanitarian coordinator Lise Grande told Reuters yesterday.\u0026nbspThe news of the laboratory-confirmed first case came after a nationwide ceasefire prompted by the virus pandemic began this week.A Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen\u0027s Houthi movement said it would halt military operations for two weeks, though the Houthis have yet to follow suit.Deaths in Scotland rise by 48A total of 495 patients have died in\u0026nbspScotland\u0026nbspafter testing positive for coronavirus, first minister\u0026nbspNicola Sturgeon has announced.The figure is an increase of 48 from 447 on Thursday. Some 5,275 people have now tested positive for the virus in\u0026nbspScotland, up by 318 from 4,957 the day before.There are 207 people in intensive care with coronavirus or coronavirus symptoms, a decrease of five on Thursday, while 1,832 people are in hospital with confirmed or suspected Covid-19.Northern Ireland death toll up 10The number of people with coronavirus who have died in a hospital setting in Northern Ireland has risen to 92, with 10 further deaths confirmed today.There were 112 new cases of the virus, bringing the total of confirmed positive tests in the region since the outbreak began to 1,589.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I translated it for him. Antonio doesn’t say anything, he mumbles, and he pulls a face as if to say, ‘I am a Spanish gentleman and I’ll do whatever a lady asks me to do.’”He called this “the most amusing moment of the night”, and said he was coming forward with the story as footage her team filmed of the evening ended up being used for\u0026nbspthe singer’s documentary, Madonna: Truth or Dare (also known as In Bed with Madonna), without Almodóvar’s permission.“I don’t mind if this seems like a settling of scores – if it had been the other way round,\u0026nbspI would have taken such a hit in the form of a lawsuit I’d still be recovering from it.

Here’s how to take the perfect picture of it:Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesUse a landmark to get perspectiveEveryone will be taking pictures of the supermoon by itself, but some of the best pictures show the moon next to a land mark or trees and houses, which is what helps to give the picture “a sense of place”, says Nasa’s senior photographer, Bill Ingalls. “Think of how to be creative – that means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.”Created with Sketch.9 best images of the 2016 supermoon Show all 9Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016The moon rises over the O2 Arena in south-east LondonA commerical jet flies in front of the moon on its approach to Heathrow airport in west London on November 13, 2016.A super moon rises over the Statue of Freedom on the Capitol dome in Washington, DC November 13, 2016.The supermoon, the closest the moon comes to Earth since 1948, rises over the Power and Light building in downtown Kansas City, Missouri, U.S., November 13, 2016A woman sits on the rooftop terrace of a house during the supermoon in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, November 13, 2016The moon rises behind the eagle sculpture high atop LeVeque Tower in Columbus, Ohio, Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises beyond the Arch in St. Louis as seen from the Compton Hill Water Tower on Sunday, Nov. 13, 2016The moon rises behind Reunion Tower in downtown Dallas, Sunday evening, Nov. 13, 2016.The moon rises over the harbor of the costal town of Lambert\u0027s Bay, South Africa, Monday, Nov. 14, 2016Pick the best spotLocation isn’t everything, but it can definitely help with getting a perfect picture of the supermoon if you have time to plan it. You can look up the best monuments or statues in your area to photograph the image of the moon against, like Mr Ingalls does in Washington D.C., where he lives. “It means doing a lot of homework. I use Google Maps and other apps – even a compass – to plan where to get just the right angle at the right time,” he told Nasa.Use an app to find the moonUnless you\u0027re an astronomer, the best way to know where the moon will rise or set is to use a app on your smartphone to locate it. There are several free or cheap options you can choose from, each using your phone\u0027s inbuilt accelerometer to know which way you\u0027re facing.The apps can also tell you what phase the moon is in, while some even give other celestial details, like the location of planets and star constellations. Decent options for iOS and Android devices include Star Chart, Sky Safari and Skyview.Get the right exposureIf you’re taking a picture on your camera, control the light balance by first tapping the screen where the moon appears to get the camera to focus on the object before dragging your finger up and down to play with the exposure. “You’ll usually want to drag it down for underexposure to be sure you have all the highlight detail,” National Geographic photographer Michael Christopher Brown said.Use a tripod for your camera or rest your phone on a solid surfaceDavid Reneke, an astronomer and writer for Australian science magazine told ABC.net that if you’re using an SLR or DSLR then it’s important to play with aperture settings on your camera to photograph the supermoon, but that using a tripod is essential.It’s worth using a tripod for taking pictures with a smartphone too, as any camera shake can compromise the quality of the pictures – but if you don’t have one to hand you can simply rest your phone on a window ledge.For older smartphones that use a digital zoom rather than an optical zoom, it’s generally best not to use the zoom as it could compromise the quality of the image. Instead, take the picture and then crop it.Newer phones like the Huawei P30 and P40 series feature incredible zoom capabilities that can take detailed pictures of far away objects. Other cameras come with special features to improve pictures of the night sky, such as the Google Pixel 4’s Astro mode.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet some arts charities have switched gears and stepped in to help, delivering emergency food packages to people in desperate need.The Auckland Project – an organisation delivering cultural and education programmes in the northeast town of Bishop Auckland – is now leading a huge emergency food operation to deliver supplies to vulnerable people in County Durham.The Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign has been supporting the work going on across the UK to ensure that everyone has enough to eat during the outbreak, backed by figures such as London mayor\u0026nbspSadiq Khan, Labour MP\u0026nbspJess Phillips\u0026nbspand TV cook\u0026nbspNigella Lawson.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Auckland Project is an impressive example of how small groups are adapting to the crisis. Based at Auckland Castle, the kitchen staff at the visitor cafe are now cooking 500 fresh meals a day. More\u0026nbspthan 10,000 of the frozen meals have been dropped off at homes in the area over the past few weeks.“We knew a big section of the community would be hit hard by this, so we felt getting food out to those in need was the best way to help,” said Liz Fisher, one of the directors at the project. “It means big changes, but the staff wanted to do all they could – they really stepped up.”How to support our campaignThe Auckland Project’s team of 17 staff and volunteers has been busy working in the kitchen, preparing dishes such as cottage pie, lasagne, mince and dumplings and carrot cake for distribution.There is a move to grow food locally, too. Two acres of the castle’s walled garden has now been set aside for planting potatoes, beans, leeks, cabbages and asparagus.“Hopefully we can start getting the food we grow here into our meals, and possibly even have a celebration dinner once we get past the crisis,” said Ms Fisher.The charity has teamed up with the South Durham Enterprise agency and another local charity called Health Express to work out which iniduals and families need support.Chris Bowron – owner of The Miners Arms on the outskirts of Bishop Auckland – is also part of the emergency food drive. His closed-up pub acts a distribution hub for the local “mutual aid” group, and Mr Bowron and a team of volunteer drivers deliver around 150 frozen meals from The Auckland Project each day.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

We have teamed up with The Felix Project – a start-up charity we helped launch in 2016 – to deliver produce to community hubs in London boroughs.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe Independent is also asking food charities across Britain to contact helpthehungry@ to tell us about your project and help build a directory of ways that our readers can help the hungry in their area – through money, volunteering and food donations. Food banks, which were already struggling to meet the need for emergency food parcels, have seen a huge surge in demand in recent weeks, while at the same time coping with dwindling donations, supermarket rationing systems, and a loss of many volunteers to self-isolation – yet none of the government’s rescue money goes to them.British households have stored more than £1bn worth of goods in their homes in response to the pandemic, creating shortages for food banks as shoppers ignore assurances that supply chains are robust.How to support our campaignJess Phillips, the Labour MP who recently ran for party leader, has backed our campaign, saying: “Nobody should be in the position of not being able to get enough food. In my constituency, London and in places all around the UK the coronavirus pandemic is placing extra stress on a system that was already straining.“We should all do what we can to help food and other essentials get to those that need it. That is why I’m backing the Help the Hungry campaign – please give if you are able.”Pastor Obi Onyeabor, the manager at Barking Foodbank, part of The Trussell Trust’s national network, said his pool of around 50 volunteers has been reduced by a dozen or so people currently self-isolating at home. Yet he and his team have kept their two church hall food banks open, and are now making home deliveries on Tuesdays and Thursdays to make sure the most vulnerable get supplies.“We have been scrambling for the past couple of weeks, doing all that we can – but we’re appealing for more people to come and help,” he said. “Out of fear people have been buying for themselves and their families, but I’ve seen some real generosity too.“I hope that if we can get past the panic buying stage, more people will want to give money, food or some of their time too.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailIn London, charities like The Felix Project donate 10 tons of food – or 22,000 meals – to the needy every day. But funding has dropped since the outbreak of Covid-19, limiting their capacity to carry out vital work at a time when it is more important than ever. As part of the London Food Alliance, along with FareShare and City Harvest, The Felix Project will coordinate deliveries in London boroughs in order to distribute surplus food to the elderly, poor and vulnerable. The charities will deliver food to the hubs, where local volunteers will package up parcels and arrange “last-mile” deliveries to the homes of the vulnerable.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, has backed our campaign to help in the capital in partnership with our sister title the Evening Standard. He said: “In a city as prosperous as London, everyone should have enough food to feed themselves and their families – but unfortunately the coronavirus outbreak means some Londoners are facing even greater difficulties. It’s commendable these organisations are joining forces to help ensure surplus food isn’t wasted and instead reaches those who need it most. I urge Londoners to support this crucial initiative.”Mark Curtin, CEO of The Felix Project, said: “Our role is to pick up large volumes of nutritious surplus food from the commercial sector and deliver it to community hubs to ensure there is enough food for vulnerable people for as long as this health crisis ensues. We will be working all hours doing our bit – and it would be wonderful if your readers can get behind us so we can do this job for London.”Emma Revie, chief executive of The Trussell Trust, which supports 1,200 food banks, appealed for help from the public to get vital food to people who cannot afford the basics, and to boost volunteer numbers in areas where they are needed.“Our main priority as coronavirus unfolds is ensuring the safety of everyone who comes to a food bank – whether it’s someone needing help, someone volunteering their time, or someone making a donation,” said Ms Revie. “Until we are confident that adequate government protection against poverty is in place, food banks provide an essential community service to people unable to afford food. But this should not fall to food banks.“Our benefits system could be the life raft people need now. That’s why it’s more important than ever that we end the five-week wait for universal credit. While incredible food bank volunteers continue to help people unable to afford the basics, we would ask our government to take this essential step and end the five-week wait now. It’s five weeks too long.”Sabine Goodwin, coordinator of the Independent Food Aid Network UK, which oversees 834 independent food banks, said the charitable services were “struggling to stay above water” in the current climate and accused the government of so far “failing to act” to prevent an ever-increasing number of people falling into poverty.“Food bank use was rising before the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of job losses can only make matters far worse. But this catastrophe in the making is avoidable,” she said. “We’re calling for an income-based solution to this crisis which would mean that the Herculean efforts by volunteers across the country wouldn’t be needed.“FareShare, the UK’s biggest food redistribution charity, is also calling for more volunteers to help with packing and making van deliveries. The organisation takes food from the food manufacturers that can’t be sold in shops, either because of packaging errors or overproduction, and gets it out to food banks, hospices, homeless hostels and other charities.Commercial director Alyson Walsh estimates around 1,200 people have got in touch over the past week. “We have quite a lot of older volunteers who have had to stay at home, but we are now seeing a wave of interest in new people willing to fill in.”Ms Walsh added: “We know we have the capacity to do more – we have the warehouse\u0026nbspspace and the chillers. But the government needs to help the food industry do more in terms of all the bagging and boxing and delivery of food that needs to be done.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Thank you.How to support our campaign“But I have to report that I have been out delivering food with Felix today and they are seeing unprecedented demand from people who cannot afford or access food.“I went to two homeless charities, The Marylebone Project and Rhythms of Life, where our deliveries are preventing deep distress. I accompanied one of 22 Felix vans that set off across the capital, filled to the brim, to ferry over 20 tons of nutritious food to three of the giant community hubs established in Barnet, Islington and Haringey, and to more than 75 charities and schools.“That’s more than double the 10 tons a day Felix were supplying in normal times.”Mr Lebedev added: “Within days, this picture is set to change dramatically yet again. Felix say\u0026nbspthey expect another 11 community hubs in another 11 boroughs to open their doors to hungry Londoners – and with it, Felix’s output will need to double again.“That is why we at The Independent\u0026nbspare committing our resources to raise another million pounds to prevent food insecurity to people already anxious about their health and that of loved ones. That is why we say: £1m raised, £1m to go. Let’s finish the job and keep vulnerable Londoners healthy and fed.”The deliveries are part of our food appeal’s support for the charities in the London Homeless Collective, the umbrella organisation of London homeless charities that The Independent\u0026nbspis working with through our Homeless Fund. Felix is delivering to other homeless organisations, as well as The Marylebone Project, including Centrepoint.Des Scott, CEO of the Church Army, which runs The Marylebone Project and provides 112 beds to homeless women under the Edgware flyover, said: “Being able to get fresh vegetables is one of the key things we can do to keep these women healthy.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The only difference is that now I stand with my megaphone and shout, ‘Guys, please, two metres apart, you’re still going to get served, two metres apart, please.’”James Bardrick, head of Citi UK, said their donation to Help The Hungry\u0026nbspcomprised a combination of company money and an (as yet unknown) aggregation of employee donations which could conceivably exceed the £50,000 minimum pledged by the bank.When can we really expect coronavirus to end?Everything you need to know on supermarket delivery slotsThe dirty truth about washing your handsWhich countries around the world has coronavirus spread to?Listen to the latest episode of The Independent Coronavirus PodcastHe added: “Our employees want to support those struggling.

Only in China is a lockdown being phased out.\u0026nbspSo much is unknown.The message from the government’s chief scientific adviser and chief medical officer this week has been that the UK needs to get past the peak before lifting measures can even be considered.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut once the pandemic\u0026nbspis over, the government will have to start lifting measures. Here’s what we know about how restrictions could potentially be phased out.The government’s guidelines tell people to avoid going outside except for a small set of activities: limited exercise, buying food and medicine, going to an essential job, or giving care.If lockdown measures are to be relaxed, says Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, it would probably be done by gradually expanding the range of these exceptions.“I would do it one step at a time and expand the number of exceptions more widely in a gradual way,” he tells The Independent.“Then look at the more social things a bit later, and say people can meet with their families now, but don’t go to rock concerts and large pub quizzes, things like that. I think that’s the way it would happen.”Some things would probably\u0026nbspcome before others. But he sounds a note of caution: “We don’t know for certain and I think people are trying to work on this at the moment.“At present the\u0026nbspUK has not made it clear what our exit strategy will eventually be and there are very good reasons for this. We simply do not have enough information to make these decisions now. For example, we still do not have good data on the amount of asymptomatic illness in the community, knowledge that is vital to know what may happen after any relaxation of restrictions.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailOffices and other workplaces\u0026nbspThe government is expected to initially try to get as much economic activity for as little risk as possible: prioritising businesses that contribute to the economy without mixing too many people into one place.“I suspect that what would happen is that we would see relaxation first around areas that are more important to society and the economy,”\u0026nbspsays Prof Hunter. “For example, jobs:\u0026nbsppeople would be able to go back to work, possibly more freely than they are at the moment.”But one of the requirements for workplaces to reopen, says Dr Sridhar Venkatapuram of the Global Health Institute at King’s College London, is a higher level of confidence about who is immune, and who has the disease.“Imagine that your boss calls you and tells you to go back to work: you might say, well, is it safe?” he tells The Independent.“There’s going to have to be a point at which iniduals are convinced that there is safety in being able to go out of their house and engage in work or any of the activities that they’re used to.“So if this phasing out is going to happen there will have to be a dramatic improvement in the knowledge of our infections, where they are, who has them.“You could implement a phasing out policy tomorrow but I guarantee you that a significant population would stay home: because they would say they don’t trust it. A massive amount of testing will have to be done, greater clarity about levels of infections – that all has to be implemented to follow through on the phasing out.”Many jobs that could continue to be done from home might be still advised to do so. There is also the question of how to cater for people who have already lost their job.“They will also be trying to get as many people who are unemployed, I would think, into jobs that don’t have high social interactions,” says Dr Venkatapuram.Pubs, bars and restaurantsBut it would be unlikely that all workplaces would come back at the same time. Those where the risk of the disease being passed around is highest would probably\u0026nbspbe put on the back-burner.“I could still imagine an easing of pressure on people going to work, but not on things like clubs and pubs and bars and cinemas – things that you don’t have to have,” says Prof\u0026nbspHunter.“I think we will initially see an expansion of the number of industries encouraged to return to normal work, then the reopening of schools and, somewhat later, bars and clubs and other entertainment venues. However, we will still need effective disease surveillance followed by isolation and rigorous contact tracing for some months.”Pints and date night films at the cinema might be some of the last things to come back.The closure of schools is one of the more scientifically controversial parts of the lockdown, but\u0026nbspthey might end up being one of the first things to reopen.“I suspect we might open schools again, partly because there is still debate about whether school closures are actually beneficial or not,” Prof\u0026nbspHunter tells The Independent.“We’ve not answered that, and there are very good reasons why school closures, in terms of the children, might actually not be that useful. And if they don’t get that ill, maybe they’re not that infectious – but it is a maybe.”But when schools do eventually open their doors again, it’s possible that they could do so with some restrictions in place on pupils.One study published in The Lancet medical journal, which looks at data from the 2003 Sars\u0026nbspoutbreak in China, suggests students could be prevented from mixing and have social-distancing measures imposed during class.“Interventions in schools, such as closing playgrounds, keeping students in constant class groupsclassrooms increasing spacing between students in classes, reducing the school week and staggering school start and break times across years or classes, should be considered if restrictive social-distancing policies are to be implemented for long periods of time,” says Professor Russell Viner, one of the authors of the study.The Times on Wednesday reported one anonymous “senior minister” saying educational establishments could open again after Easter – though in public the government has given no hint of what might come.Sporting and cultural eventsUnfortunately for sports fans, football matches and other mass gatherings look like they will be the last parts of society to return to normal – they simply involve too many people.“What it will be is a slow allowing people to go back to work where they will not be in crowded or group situations.”Thus, Glastonbury is likely to remain cancelled the Premier League postponed – along with other major events.What will come next?\u0026nbspMost experts are agreed that increased testing and “contact tracing” are crucial to allowing society to return to normal as quickly as possible. But even with these measures, some are warning that\u0026nbsplockdown measures could be switched on and off for months until a vaccine is found, or enough people build up immunity – both prospects are potentially one or two years away.“To see us through the next year or more, we must all prepare for several cycles of a ‘suppress and lift’ policy,” Dr Gabriel Leung, chair of public health medicine at the University of Hong Kong wrote in The New York Times.“Cycles during which restrictions are applied and relaxed, applied again and relaxed again, in ways that can keep the pandemic under control but at an acceptable economic and social cost.” The end of the lockdown may not be the first end of the lockdown.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The former New York mayor skipped the first caucus in Iowa and instead campaigned in California on 3 FebruaryHe added: “The worst crime he committed, in the eyes of the establishment, is not the policy he’s proposing it’s the fact that he was able to inspire popular movements, which had already been developing — Occupy, Black Lives Matter, many others — and turn them into an activist movement, which doesn’t just show up every couple years to push a leader and then go home, but applies constant pressure, constant activism and so on.”Many commentators have pointed out that because of Mr Sanders’s success and the way he especially inspired young voters – he won the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada – visually every Democratic candidate was obliged to have their own policies on topics such as climate change, greater accessibly to healthcare, and criminal justice reform.As it, Mr Sanders has said his name will remain on the ballot in the primaries remaining and he will continue to collect and accrue. He said this was a deliberate tactic to try and put pressure on the committee that agrees the party’s official policy platform this summer.Mr Chomsky said if Donald Trump\u0026nbspwere elected it would be an “indescribable disaster”.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I just mentioned the Lancet figures. It will get worse. What this means for the environment or the threat of nuclear war, which no one is talking about but is extremely serious, is indescribable.”He said he assumed a Biden presidency would be a continuation of former president Barack Obama’s administration “nothing very great, but at least not totally destructive, and opportunities for an organised public to change what is being done, to impose pressures”.Israel intervention in US election greater than Russia’s, says ChomskyNoam Chomsky says antifa is gift to far right and US state repressionChomsky says Trump brought Doomsday Clock alarmingly close to midnightNoam Chomsky argues Antifa is a ‘major gift to the right’He said if Mr Biden, 77, were elected Mr Sanders and his supporters could continue to seek to put that pressure on him.Aware that he will need the backing and votes on Mr Sanders’s supporters if he is to defeat Mr Trump in November, Mr Biden immediately paid tribute to the senator after he suspended his campaign. In a statement directed at those who had so vigorously supported the veteran democratic socialist, he also said: “I see you, I hear you.”On Thursday, in what was seen as another nod to the progressives he need to win over, he unveiled two new proposals he said would help ease the “economic burden on working people”.These were a proposed lowering of the age eligibility for Medicare from 65 to 60 and eliminating student debt for some lower-income families.“In our nation’s 244 years, we have never weathered a crisis that we did not emerge from stronger,” Mr Biden wrote. “This one will be no different.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I apologise to Tedros on behalf of the Taiwanese and beg for his forgiveness.”In a statement, Taiwan’s justice ministry said the posts actually appeared to be a coordinated campaign from the mainland, designed to drive a wedge further between the WHO and Taiwan.At a briefing, the ministry’s investigations team said the posts were suspicious because of the similarity of their wording, and the fact that they mainly feature the simplified Chinese characters more common to the mainland.“There is a concern it is a deliberate operation by overseas forces,” the ministry said. “Falsely claiming to be Taiwanese, and openly admitting to racist attacks on WHO director general Tedros and begging forgiveness, seriously damages our country’s international reputation.”Also on Friday, Taiwan’s president, Tsai Ing-wen, issued a “strong protest” against Tedros’s suggestion that the abuse he had been receiving came from Taiwan.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Donald Trump threatened this week to withdraw US funding from the agency, calling its approach “China-centric”.“They’ve been wrong about a lot of things,” he told a daily briefing, where he suggested the WHO was influenced by Beijing in downplaying the severity of the outbreak when it first began. “They missed the call. They could have called it months earlier. They would have known and they should have known and they probably did know,” Mr Trump said.Other countries, like India, have erged from WHO recommendations in a number of ways, formulating their own strategies for dealing with the virus. While Tedros said “test, test, test” was the best policy, India instead aggressively shut down first international travel and then movement within the country, while testing remained at minimal levels.In Taiwan, some internet users have used the WHO row to draw attention back to the positive ways it is seen as having responded to the coronavirus pandemic.Thanks to an early and effective prevention strategy – Taiwan was one of the places to start screening passengers from Wuhan in January – the island has reported just 382 cases of the virus to date, and on Friday confirmed its sixth death, an elderly patient with underlying health conditions.Under the English hashtag #ThisAttackComesFromTaiwan, Twitter users wrote about all the good things that come from the island, including its democratic system and being the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage.And using the hashtag alongside pictures of medical supplies being offloaded from an aircraft, foreign minister Joseph Wu tweeted: “Our assistance to allies in Central America has arrived safely. The people of Taiwan are proud to help friends in time of need.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Stella was at the front - the star of todays show.It was a joyful scene, but as I shouted Say cheese!, Stella suddenly threw herself onto the floor, pulled off her knickers, pointed her legs upwards and parted them to face the camera.Shocked, Lloyd instantly put down the camera and looked at me.I felt my face crumple, as I blinked back tears.Though we had never seen anything like this before - and there was nothing in Stellas placement file about sexual abuse - we knew what it must mean: shed been sexually exploited.It was a devastating realisation - and one we promptly reported to social workers.Yet it was only one of several signs hinting at our foster daughters horrendous past.Before coming to us, I learned, Stella had stripped off in her first PE lesson at school. She had stood completely naked in front of her classmates, with bruises visible on her upper arms.Then, months into her placement with us, I found Stella had been drawing men with spiky teeth in her sketchbook. One picture showed three smiling men with big, erect penises. Another was of a man with a huge, rounders bat-style arm, reaching down towards her genital area.It was a childs gallery of abuse.Another time, I offered Stella a Lion Bar - only for her to recoil in horror.Though she looked at some foods - like lasagne - as though they had arrived from outer space, she had experienced many new things with us and enjoyed snacks as much as any child.But one glimpse at the Lion Bar and she fled to the end of the garden.It was strange behaviour, yet at the time, we could never have guessed the meaning behind it.That would come from a police investigation - sparked by our reports - which found that Stella had been exploited by a highly-organised, systematic paedophile ring, likely involving her own parents.Barely of school age, she had been photographed naked and passed around paedophiles, while her mum Shannon allegedly used a Lion Bar to control her. It was so, so warped and wrong.Though we will never know the full horror of what Stella endured, we do know she was dumped as a baby by Shannon - then a struggling -year-old mum - and left in her grandmothers care.Her dad Terry, in his late s, was in prison at the time - and when he came out, he took Stella back to live with him in his dingy flat, while Shannon carved a new le for herself where.But unbeknown to Terrys relatives, he had allegedly become involved in child sex abuse images behind bars. Now, alone with Stella, he was perfectly placed to find a child for vile purposes.Later, neighbours would notice a stream of men going in and out of the property.Yet even when Stella was discovered abandoned in the freezing flat years on - surrounded by empty beer cars, her own faeces and her dads pit bull terrier, Sharky - the abuse didnt stop.Instead, she was taken back in by Shannon - whom police believe also became involved in the abuse herself. Eager to make cash, the mum allegedly took Stella on trips to her fathers to be exploited.This will be a living hell for some, she tells Sun Online.I feel for all the women in domestic situations who are being beaten. I feel for the children who are witnessing that. I feel for the children who are being abused right now.There will be a lot of abuse going on.She also says the ageing fostering community is at risk of COVID-, which has already killed more than , people in the UK.I know foster carers that have died of the virus, she tells us.You have to factor in were an ageing workforce. They cant recruit foster carers, sadly, and a lot of foster carers are in their s and s.Louise, a best-selling author and artist who grew up in the care system in Oxford, is currently caring for two foster children.Yet while she says her own experience of lockdown is going smoothly, she acknowledges other foster families will be struggling.Ive looked after children who are deeply violent, she says.I can think of children I have looked after where,they were in lockdown with me, it would be the equivalent of domestic abuse. Weve been held hostage in our own home by an eight-year-old!There will be foster families and regular families who are going to be in a place of hell right now. Exploitation means a betrayal of innocence. It is a sullying of that clean, fresh time of being a ‘child’. There is no way to take that away again - as I know all too well myself.I was also abused as a child: my adopted mother repeatedly starved and beat me. So I know Stella will probably spend much of her le trying to recall, forget, understand and find answers.Her anguish was clear to us the day she finally used her voice.After Lily accidentally dropped some of her belongings, Stella screamed, You f***ing, c***ing t**t, adding: You wait! I will f***ing stick my fist so far up your c*** it will knock your eyes out.It was like a scene from Fight Club, but with worse language.Abused children in the care system, like Stella, need to be approached inidually and sensitively.But unfortunately, they are often simply stuck in front of a therapist or another trained professional in the well-intentioned but mistaken belief it will somehow fix them.I have seen rushed psychologists try to assess kids in just a single hour.Its always budgets versus what is actually best - and budgets usually win.In Stellas case, neither of her parents were convicted over the paedophile ring - her mum vanished during the police investigation and there was deemed insufficient evidence anyway.Today, Stella has many physical scars. The abuse she suffered was so severe shes had to undergo operations - with more lying ahead of her - and will never go through pregnancy herself.But despite what shes been through, shes found happiness - both at my house, and with her adopted dad, Danny, whom shes been living with for years and lovingly calls Dad.They are so lucky to have found each other.Stella brought such joy into our house during her months with us.This week, countless other children like her will be suffering abuse under the radar.To their abusers, the coronavirus lockdown must seem like the perfect opportunity for manipulation and control. Who can help their victims at this time of crisis  Who can hear them When this is over, I think there will be a real need for many, many more foster placements.And like tens of thousands of others across the UK, Lloyd and myself, , will be there, ready to welcome a new precious child into our own blended family for days, weeks, months or even years.In , I have no doubt well receive yet more joy, laughter and happy memories.The NSPCC has more information and advice about child sexual abuse - which affects one in  children in the UK - on its website.If you are concerned about your own thoughts or behaviour towards children, you can phone Stop It Now! in confidence on    or email help@stopitnow.org.uk.If you are a child and someone is sexually abusing you, you can get help and advice from ChildLine – phone  , calls are free and confidential.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Get it on now.”So there it sits, Monday to Friday at pm. The Steph Show, hosted by the former BBC Breakfast presenter, from her Yorkshire home, with nothing for company but a mission statement: “It’s a power hour of positivity.”An easy thing to claim, an impossible thing to deliver without ideas, creativity, content or anything other than secondhand clips and the same old guestsyou’ve seen clogging up every other show recently.The Steph Show has one thing and one thing only in its favour, though. Honesty.She promised viewers it “might be a bit rough around the edges”, and has been utterly faithful to her word, starting last Monday, when Steph went hurtling round her house to show off the remote cameras and then spent the next ten minutes gasping for air.Over the following  minutes, Skype links maled, mobile phones went off and an attempt to kick off a feature about weird dreams, with Keith Lemon, was shut down as quickly as it started.“What did you ask Michael Hutchence in your dream ”“Things he did romantically with Kylie Minogue that . . . ” “OK, let’s move on.”Had you thought day two was going to improve things, you probably banished those thoughts when Steph began with her own epitaph: “If you tuned in yesterday, you’ll know this is the show that isn’t meant to be on yet.”Or any other day for that matter, although Tuesday’s episode was a technical cracker and climaxed when someone rang Steph’s doorbell, mid-episode. We never did find out who, but I’m willing to bet good money it wasn’t Bafta.And so this hypnotic mess continued throughout the week.Thursday, however, was the day the edice really crumbled, as Steph attempted to lead a mass, safe-distance dancing demonstration, from a car-park in Bristol.Until it transpired the choreographer was at such a safe distance from her CD player it’d be another minute or so before it could start.Honestly, you’ve never heard a silence so awkward or so deafening and it was hard not to have a measure of sympathy for Steph and her production team, who’ve clearly been thrown under a bus by Channel .I say a measure of sympathy, because professional northerner Steph is hardly the underdog she’d have you believe.Her close friend, Sinead Rocks, is MD for the regions at Channel ’s Leeds HQ and, while there’s no suggestion she had anything to do with her recruitment, there’s always an assumption Steph McGovern is “a good thing”.Having never concentrated on her work before I’m going to assume this is for box-ticking, rather than professional, reasons, because, based on her performance here, she’s not a good presenter.For a start, she chunters for Britain, has a knack for saying exactly the wrong thingand crunches the gears during an interview like Jack Grealish heading back to lockdown.: “Provided the last laugh in Germany, did you  What are your tips for attracting wildle ” Eh  There’s more than a hint of The Fast Show about her as well.Absolutely everything is “brilliant”, especially when it’s not. It’s her habit of thinking out loud that could be the death of The Steph Show, though.“Hey! Let’s have our own talent show. Maybe your nan can yodel, your dog can dance.”Or your sister can present daytime TV without mentioning her baby. Every. Five. Minutes. I sense a vacancy in the offing.BASKET-case football club Sunderland and its army of long-suffering fans are trapped in an abusive relationship with Netflix.Every couple of years the streaming service gets to broadcast the most heartbreaking and brilliant documentary series anywhere on television, Sunderland ’Til I Die.In , they get defeat, ridicule, embarrassment and another story of failure told largely through the bracketed series of doom-laden captions that accompany every fresh disappointment: “Indistinct chatter”, “Seagulls cawing”. “Man yells”. “Jack Ross screams”. “Men chant gregariously”, and always “Tense music playing”.You get the impression, of course, the supporters love the attention that comes with losing which, in turn, tends to attract  prophets and publicity-crazed “saviours” to the club. Series two begins with a new owner, Stewart Donald, arriving at The Stadium Of Light along with public schoolboy executive director Charlie Methven, very much the David Brent of the piece, who understands only two things, attendance figures and metaphors and should’ve been ridden out of town the moment he turned up wearing pink corduroy trousers.Improbably, Sunderland also seem to have found a brilliant striker, Josh Maja, who you absolutely know is on the first stage out of Dodge the moment he arrives to turn on Sunderland’s Christmas lights and promises: “I’ll be here next year.”From that point on, disaster’s guaranteed but has to be spelt out to Charlie and Stewart by Graham at the Roker Rapport podcast: “If Will Grigg was the manager’s signing, how come he can’t find a way to play him ”“Um . . . ”BEFORE Friday night, I was convinced a mixture of resolution and good humour would see us through this crisis.No bad thing, but they also need to ditch the host, two guestsand Paul Merton and Ian Hislop, who all appeared, via Skype and remote cameras, in front of their own chosen back-grounds, on Friday.An open invitation to reveal the inner tosspot, they weren’t ever going to refuse.Hislop had a vast library behind him, as befits the intellectual colossus he imagines himself to be, while feminist author Helen Lewis was carefully positioned in front of her new book, exploiting a global pandemic for commercial gain in a manner that seems to be perfectly acceptable to the BBC, so long as you’re left-wing.If your stomach wasn’t already turned enough, the following half hour probably did the job as the four lists and host Steph McGovern cackled demonically at the brilliance of their own route-one puns.“Hasn’t Boris got his Churchill moment now ”Hislop: “Yes. Churchill the dog! HAHAHA.”Nothing, you think, could ever look more sinister, witless and terminally self-satisfied, during this whole crisis, than Friday’s Have I Got News For You.Piers Morgan: “Joe , I’ve reached the point where I may need to join in with your workouts.” .And Piers Morgan: “Let’s move on from talking about ourselves.”Yeah, that’s enough about me, let’s talk about you.

For those of you who say this virus is nothing out of the ordinary, a big fuss about nothing – how often do we have a Prime Minister in intensive care We all wish Boris a swt recovery. The country needs a strong leader at a time like this and Boris has proved, in three short months, he is that leader.There have been calls for a national unity government. All the parties coming together to see us through this crisis. It’s happened before, of course — most famously during World War Two, when we had a coalition government led by Boris’s hero, Sir Winston Churchill. We had one during the Napoleonic Wars back in , too, when that short French tosser was causing havoc in Europe.But do we need one now I think not. The only reason people are raising the issue now is because the Labour Party at last has a leader who isn’t actually certiable.Nobody would seriously think that giving power to an oaf like Jeremy Corbyn would help us through this crisis.But there are plenty of other reasons to object. First of all, we kind of already have a unity government.The Conservatives have a whopping -seat majority. In the last opinion poll Boris had  per cent of the country behind him, thinking he was doing a good job. That’s about as close to unanimous as you will ever get in a democracy. The Government, then, has a free hand.Perhapsthis virus had struck back in October last year, there might have been a point. Then we had a paralysed government with no working majority.Battling this virus would have been nigh on impossible in such a position. But the December General Election changed all that.But then there’s this. Unity governments are usually convened when we are threatened by a foreign power — as happened in World Wars One and Two and indeed the Napoleonic Wars. There have been brief exceptions.But by and large we have a unity government to show the foreign power that the whole country is united. The virus isn’t a ­foreign power. It is an insentient microscopic parasite. It doesn’t give a monkey’s who is running the country.But the most important objection is this. We are a democracy. And democracy is no less important during times of crisis than at other times. And we need a competent opposition to hold the Government to account. Boris and co haven’t done a bad job, so far. But there are plenty of questions that could be asked. Did the Government react too slowly  Why do our frontline medical staff not have adequate protection against the virus  Why did we allow planes to land from China, back in March, when the danger was apparent.OK, you may think some of those questions unfair. And asked with the benefit of hindsight. But it is the job of the Opposition to ask dficult questions, to challenge policies and highlight incompetency.I would argue that is more vital now than at any time in the last  years.Labour’s new leader, Sir Keir Starmer appears to be a sensible bloke.He is generally behind the Government in its fight against this pandemic.But he must be allowed to question, in public, the Government’s policies.We are no less unied when dficult questions are asked of politicians.The more those dficult questions are asked, the quicker this virus will be beaten.The Sun has launched an appeal to raise £MILLION for NHS workers.The Who Cares Wins Appeal aims to get vital support to staff in their hour of need.We have teamed up with NHS Charities Together in their urgent Covid- Appeal to ensure the money gets to exactly who needs it.The Sun is donating £, and we would like YOU to help us raise a million pounds, to help THEM.No matter how little you can spare, please donate today herewww.thesun whocareswinsappealLIFE will never be the same again. No, I’m not talking about this wretched virus for once.The Labour Party has got rid of almost all of its nutters from positions of influence.Diane Abbott has gone. John McDonnell has gone.So has the former chairman, the godawful Geordie Ian Lavery.Corbyn himself will be gone very soon.What are we going to do for a laugh without these clowns spouting rubbish all day long Luckily — thank the Lord! — the genuinely berserk David Lammy has been installed as Shadow Justice Secretary.It’s up to you, now David, you dingbat. Keep us chuckl­ing during these dark days.DONALD Trump has turned his guns on the World Health Organisation.He’s threatened to cut off its funding. He reckons the WHO has handled the virus pandemic very badly.The WHO told Trump he was wrong to ban flights from China at the start of the outbreak because it “wasn’t necessary”.He said: “The WHO receives vast amounts of money from the United States and we pay for a majority, the biggest portion of their money, and they actually criticised and disagreed with my travel ban at the time I did it.“And they were wrong. They’ve been wrong about a lot of things.”He may look like a morbidly obese Belisha beacon in a badly fitting wig.He may sometimes talk out of his a***hole. He may have the diplomatic abilities of a semi-housetrained wolverine.But he may well be dead right on this.SOME experts reckon we could be in a state of lockdown until well into autumn.That sounds pretty grim. But there is a silver lining.It means that tour by Genesis might have to be called off.WHO’S nicked all the flour, then  Can’t find the stuff anywhere.It’s aspeople thought: “Uh oh. Armageddon’s coming. Better make a really nice cake. Maybe a coffee one with walnuts, or something. Or a Swiss roll.” I suppose stockpiling flour is more sensible than stockpiling bog rolls. People seem to have given up on that now. Crisps, though, are selling out really quickly.As I mentioned last week, that’s because most sensible people are sitting on their sofas watching Netflix.

That explains the tragedy of young doctors and nurses dying.And also London bus drivers – nine have died so far.All the people selflessly working in frontline jobs where they meet thousands of people deserve proper protection.These PPE kits cost less than  quid per person. Not much to ask, is it I SEE that my home town is in the news.Middlesbrough has been named the place in the UK where people are least likely to obey social distancing directives.This is almost certainly because they think thatthe virus comes anywhere near them, they’ll kick its f***ing head in.“Come near me, you radged microscopic t**t, and I’ll give you a split lip.”JUST seen a report that says our pets don’t know what the hell is going on.They don’t know why we’re home all the time. And they don’t get why we’re so stressy.I tried to explain to my daughter’s hamster, Alastair, what the problem was.“It’s the coronavirus,” I told it. “We’re all a bit worried.”It looked at me levelly for a moment and said: “Well stop Chinese people eating small mammals, then,” before crapping on my hand and going back to run around on its stupid wheel.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They are researching, collating, and passing on advice and guidance in a fast changing environment.The volume of work has, understandably, increased over the last few weeks and they are working through it with all the additional challenges of working remotely.If things are a bit slower than usual, please bear with us as we navigate these uncharted waters.

We all need to take responsibility here. This is not about overreach.“We had scurrilous stories a few weeks ago about officers snooping through baskets and removing Easter eggs and that became a trading standards issue.“That is not what the police are there to do. As I said the police are there for public order.“I will be very candid, not everyone will get this right. It will take a few weeks to have these measures bed in.“We want our public spaces to be respected and utilised in the right way.“This is not about heavy handed law enforcement. I pay credit to the police, and the majority of the British public – these are extraordinary times.“But the fact of the matter is,you’re having a party or having a mass gathering do not be surprisedthe police come up and ask you to stop.“The police are using a common sense approach. Enforcement will always be used as a last resort.”In her interview Priti went on to accuse Yvette Cooper of playing politics and insisted she had given the Labour MP a date to appear in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee.When askedshe was concernedYvette wanted to publicly quiz her over bullying allegations made before the start of the crisis, and whether she wanted to deny those on the record, Priti answered: “This is not what this is about at all.“I have offered the chair of the committee regular briefings throughout this pandemic, including access to classied material.“It is disappointing to see this at the time of the crisis when I have already offered a date. There is politicking going on.“When you look at the work of the Home Office during this pandemic, by making  calls free of charge, through the extension of NHS visas, to ious things we’ve been doing across fraud, cyber, national security, policing every single day and the help we are giving to the front line – a lot of that is self evident.“I quite frankly think it is politicking, when we have given access to the entire committee to the department, to myself in terms of another date.“I just think it’s politics basically.”Priti also went on to give up an update about Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who on Thursday night was moved to a ward after spending three nights in intensive care at St Thomas Hospital in London.She said: “He is doing well from what we’re hearing, but we should take great heart that he is in the care of the NHS. We are rooting for him. He is really great, we just want him to get well now.”“I spoke to him last week, around the last cabinet meeting and then it was clear he was unwell and that he needed rest and recoup.“He has been working flat out leading us through this, we need to give him the time and space to recover. We wish him well.”During the interview Priti went on to say the government were considering new measures to help domestic violence victims and confirmed she would be laying out the plans next week.She said of domestic abuse victims on lockdown with their partners: “This is an absolute priority for the police.“I have spent a lot of time speaking to charities and third parties and also the victims commissioner.“There is a lot of work taking place, I have already been resourcing this area. But of course the longer the pandemic continues there will be all sorts of issues around people staying at home and victims of abuse being with their perpetrators.

My body ached severely, I felt so heavy and was sweating with a fever.Doctors have warned that a loss of taste or smell could also be a sign of coronavirus.The British Association of Otorhinolaryngology, which represents experts in ear, nose and throat medicine, explained that an eye infection conjunctivitis may also be another sign.In a statement, the docs said: Evidence from other countries that the entry point for the coronavirus is often in the eyes, nose and throat areas.A study published in JAMA Ophthalmology found that . per cent of  patients with COVID- at a hospital in the Hubei province had eye-related symptoms - although further studies are needed on a larger scale.A number of people who go on to have coronavirus first report losing their sense of smell or tasteIts thought that losing the ability to smell or taste could be due to the virus destroying cells in the nose and throat.Experts say its something people can commonly experience after having other types of coronaviruses - such as the common cold.Prof Carl Philpott, of the Norwich Medical School at UEA, said: Coronaviruses have previously been associated with what we refer to as post-viral olfactory loss– this is smell loss that persists after a cold.There are many respiratory viruses that can potentially cause problems with the smell receptors.So far with Covid-, the smell loss appears to be transient but only as time elapses will we know how many people have a more permanent loss.Ryan Van Waterschoot ended up in hospital for  days with coronavirus, and losing his sense of smell and taste were the first few symptoms.Just a day after losing the two senses, he went from feeling tired to not being able to move in just one day, before his temperature soared and he was rushed to hospital, where he was given oxygen for five days.The -year-old said: I didn’t think I was going to make it out of the hospital. I thought it was the end of the road for me.Some people may experience brain fog, also known as mental fatigue, as another symptom of coronavirus.Its not been officially looked into as a symptom but its another indicator that those who have experienced the illness have reported experiencing.Thea Jourdan, , said she didnt experience a cough or fever - instead her introduction to Covid- began with a tickle in her throat and a dull headache,.The mum-of-three, from Hampshire, says she then started to experience brain fog.She told the Daily Mail: Initially I felt exhausted, asI was dragging myself through treacle and had no choice but to go to my bed. I had no meaningful cough and I wasn’t running a fever.But I had a peculiar sensation of something settling deep within my lungs, almost like breathing in talcum powder.I also had brain fog. I was unable even to fill out forms from the children’s schools. I just wanted to sleep.Another woman, who had recently recovered from Covid-, told the Huffington Post that she too had experienced the unusual mental block before her symptoms worsened.Christy, from Seattle, had a similar feeing of brain fog - she said her illness started with a multi-day fever that progressed into sinus congestion and a headache following it.She added: “It’s not just a cold. I’m pretty healthy and not old , and it kicked my a**.”Another symptom that coronavirus patients have reported is feeling extremely tired before symptoms develop.According to a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association, up to  per cent of those hospitalised with Covid- reported exhaustion and fatigue.Linda Carr, , from Hethersett, Norfolk, told the Mail: I felt very sick and terribly fatigued. But I didn’t have a temperature or a cough.Within two days I could barely stand. I didn’t have the energy to lt one foot in front of the other.But she knew it was more serious than a flu when she developed a tightness in her chest that left her short of breath.After visiting her GP, she was sent straight to hospital where she was kept for five days after testing positive.Linda says she is still feeling weak and remains in isolation at home.Those who develop minor symptoms such as a high temperature or continuous cough should self-isolate for seven days.If you live with others, you should also stay at home for  days from the day the first person started showing symptoms.Anyone with suspected coronavirus who becomes seriously ill should call  and in a medical emergency always call .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Heres what we know.Priti Patel came under criticism for refusing to appear in front of a select committee to discuss the coronavirus outbreak in April, .She had turned down four invitations to appear before the Home Affairs Committee since January but had been offering private briefings.Priti defended herself in an interview with The Sun’s Executive Editor Dan Wootton during this talkRADIO Drivetime show on April .In her first interview since the UK went into lockdown, she accused Labour MP Yvette Cooper of playing politics and insisted she had given Cooper a date to appear in front of the Home Affairs Select Committee.Since she was appointed Home Secretary in July  she has only appeared in front of the committee once.Patel has not appeared at any of the Governments daily coronavirus press briefings sparking suggestions from some she may have been sidelined because she was a woman.She broke her silence to blast Northamptonshire’s Chief Constable Nick Adderley over his threat to snoop on the British public’s shopping baskets during the coronavirus lockdown.In a press conference he warned officers would stop and search trolliesthe public ignored lockdown measures.The police threat was not appropriate and wasnt part of the governments guidance, she told Wootton.She urged Brits to adhere to the lockdown over the Easter weekend and praised the public for their reaction to measures put in place by the government so farShe said the government was considering new measures to help domestic violence victims who were stuck in lockdown with their abusive partners and confirmed she would be laying out the plans next week.And said there had been an increase in threats to the public from online fraudsters since the beginning of the pandemic.Prime Minister Boris Johns appointed Priti Patel to the role of Home Secretary on July , , replacing Sajid Javid, who was promoted to Chancellor.She is a Conservative MP who has served the Witham constituency in Essex since .The -year-old Brexiteer was forced to resign as International Development Secretary in November  after holding  secret meetings in Israel without following protocol.Priti is a long-standing supporter of Israel and a former vice-chairman of CFI.Born in London to a Ugandan Indian migrant family and educated at a comprehensive school in Watford, Patel went on to study economics at Keele University before completing her postgraduate studies at the University of Essex.In , Priti was appointed as Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury and following the  General Election was appointed as the new Minister for Employment at the Department for Work and Pensions.A longstanding Eurosceptic, Patel was a leading figure in the Vote Leave campaign during the  EU referendum.Following David Camerons resignation, Patel backed PM Theresa May who subsequently appointed her as International Development Secretary in the summer of .Priti Patel told the Tory party conference in October , the government would introduce an Australian-style points system that works in the best interests of Britain.Reiterating the hard-line immigration pledge in Manchester, Ms Patel said: I have a particular responsibility when it comes to taking back control.It is to end the free movement of people once and for all.Instead we will introduce an Australian style points-based immigration system.One that works in the best interests of Britain.Ms Patel also announced a £million fund to tackle county lines drugs gangs to stop them “terrorising” Britain’s kids.The meetings in Israel were held between August  and ,  while Patel was on holiday with her family.The Department for International Developmentrevealed that Patel held  meetings in  days including Benjamin Netanyahu, Gilad Erdan, the public security minister and Yair Lapid, leader of Israel’s centrist Yesh Atid party, without telling the foreign office in advance.But she insisted that her trip had “nothing to do with foreign policy” saying the trip was “a family holiday paid for myself”, but admitted that, on ing, she had “commissioned departmental work on humanitarian and development partnership between Israel and the UK, and on disability”.The meetings were arranged by Lord Polack, the honorary president of the lobbying group Conservative Friends of Israel - and UK government policy toward the Middle East ally was reportedly discussed.Patel did not tell the Foreign Office before meeting with Israeli prime minister and other politicians, businesses and charities.She appeared to have avoided the sack over the trip after admitting she had shown a “lack of precision” over the wording she used on Friday when she suggested that Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson knew about it in advance.She conceded that Boris was not told in advance and that she held  meetings rather than the two originally reported.The revelations emerged while the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in London this week to mark the centenary of the Balfour Declaration when Britain first gave its support for a national home for the Jewish people.A spokesman for Patel said: “The Foreign Office are clear that UK interests were not damaged or affected by the meetings on this visit.”In his memoir For The Record, David Cameron criticised Priti Patels role in the Brexit referendum campaign.He accused her of using every announcement, interview and speech to hammer the governments approach to immigration, even though she was in it.But he said that he was stuck with her in his administration becausehe fired her she would become a Brexit martyr.Patel has since brushed off his comments, saying: There is no point in going over the past.Obviously the referendum has happened, we have moved on and the fact of the matter is we are now working to deliver that referendum mandate.That is so important. There is no point in going over the past."},{"url":null,"title":"debenhams uk store closures latest","story":"Read on to find out which branches are set to close, and why.Debenhams revealed in April  that it was continuing with plans set before it went into administration to close  stores in .As a result of falling into administration again in April , it also decided to axe all  of its shops in Ireland.It had previously closed  stores in January , including Altrincham, Wolverhampton, Ashford and Wimbledon.Weve asked Debenhams how many stores its closed in total over the past few years and well update this story as soon as we get a response.Debenhams told us the exact locations of the  stores set to close next year are still to be determined.It currently has  shops remaining.Debenhams went into administration in April .Its the second time the department store chain has gone bust in a year and also follows a company voluntary arrangement- a type of insolvency process.Debenhams has appointed business advisory firm FRP Advisory to oversee the process.The -year-old retailer last entered administration in April .Back then, lenders took control of the struggling retailer which wiped out the investments of shareholders, including Sports Direct billionaire Mike Ashley.But stores remained open and the retailer says this time round it will work to re-open and trade as many stores as possible when coronavirus related lockdown restrictions are lted.Debenhams website is currently trading as normal and it even has a half price Easter sale on.Customers are still able to spend their gt cards online and in storesas normal.But shoppers might want to consider using any gt cards they have while the retailer is still accepting them.Debenhams points out that online, you can only use one gt card per transaction.Returns are still being accepted as usual.But again, you might want to consider ing or exchanging items sooner rather than later to be on the safe side - thatsyoure able to do so safely during lockdown.You should also consider putting new purchases on credit card as this will give you greater protectionsomething goes wrong with the purchase and youre unable to get your money back from Debenhams.Debit card purchases also offer some protection, but not to the same extent as those offered by credit cards."},{"url":null,"title":"pressure to end coronavirus lockdown","story":"Ministers are reluctant to lt the strict measures despite experts claiming that Brits “cannot hide away forever”.Dominic Raab – filling in for Boris Johnson - warned yesterday it was still too early for social distancing to be lted.And epidemiologist Professor Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said “definitive” proof of whether the nationwide-lockdown has worked will take “several more weeks”.He explained: “It is only when we see the case numbers come down and how quickly transmissions have been reduced we can really conclude anything about what happens next, when these measures can be relaxed”.It is believed that less than  per cent of the population has had the virus and Mr Raab said that discussing a route out of lockdown would be a “distraction”.Scientists are still struggling to identy how restrictions could be eased without causing more harm to the public, the Times reports.But Rupert Shute, the deputy scientic adviser at the Home Office, warned yesterday that  per cent of the population will eventually get Covid-.He added said that while staying at home was important “we also have to keep ing our lives”.Mr Shute told the BBC: “You are no more at risk at the workplace than you would be in your home or at the supermarket.

However, deaths could continue to rise for a considerable period of time because they lag behind newly-diagnosed infections, and take time to be officially recorded.  Experts say this overall pattern shows we are “flattening the curve” - which was stricken PM Boris Johnson ’s mantra before he himself was hospitalised with Covid-.Lockdown was initiated based on Government modelling showing the reproduction numberwas between  and ..

Prof James Naismith, biology expert at Oxford University, said: “There is now evidence that social distancing measures are having the expected effect. “Fewer people are getting infected which means fewer people will need intensive care which means fewer people will die.  “The lockdown has some weeks to run to bring down the number of infections and reduce pressure on the NHS.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid EmailUK health chiefs are considering the idea of freeing younger people from coronavirus lockdown earlier than the elderly, two of the governmentaposs most senior advisors said today. Experts at Warwick University floated the idea this week - which could include reopening schools - because young people face a comparatively lower risk from Covid . Warwickaposs briefing paper, The case for releasing the young from lockdown, suggested releasing those aged - who do not live with older citizens, as the best approach to eventually lting the lockdown. Data suggested it could allow . million young adults to resume their daily lives, and shield society against an economic collapse. Medics and government ministers have made clear the lockdown will not be lted in any way for at least a few weeks, despite a review next week, and have urged people to focus on sticking to the rules. However, ministers are also facing questions about what the exit strategy will eventually be once the number of coronavirus infections starts to drop. Prof Paul Cosford, Emeritus Medical Director of Public Health England, today said releasing younger people earlier than others is being looked at. Asked directly about the idea, he told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: All those are sort of things that will need to be considered and are being considered. Prof Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London, who is leading government modelling of the virus, added: Without doubt measures will be targeted, probably by age, by geography, and we will need to introduce - in my view - much larger levels of testing at a community level to really be able to isolate cases and more effectively identy where transmission has happened. Medics have stressed that, while the risk of complications is far higher in the elderly, anyone of any age can fall seriously ill and die from Covid-. Prof Cosford said closing schools was an “important measure” to stop the spread of the virus, but said that despite some tragic cases, children are “at very low risk of getting serious complications”.  He added: “The importance of children’s eduction and children being in school is paramount. “That’s not the only issue, but I could conceive of circumstances in which some of the restrictions are lted sooner and some are lted later.” Asked directlyschools could open in a first wave of easing restrictions, he said: “Maybe. Some countries are looking at that. Other countries are looking at dferent ways of doing this.”  However, Prof Cosford also warned we have an “awfully long way to go” before any restrictions are lted at all, and “several weeks isn’t unreasonable. Let’s hope it’s sooner than that.” Ministers have also refused to be drawn on when schools could reopen, with few expecting them to open their doors after the Easter break and Scotlandaposs Nicola Sturgeon predicting they wonapost. All my experience dealing with any sort of infectious disease suggests once you start getting things under control, that is the time you absolutely need to continue with all your measures so you can bring the disease right down, essentially to crack it across the country, Prof Cosford said.  Professor Stephen Powis, the National Medical Director of NHS England, also suggested the idea was under consideration. Askedrestrictions could be lted by age and geography, he told Sky News today: “Those discussions are still taking place. There are lots of options being looked at.” But just like Public Health England, Prof Powis emphasised we shouldnapost expect any measures to be lted any time soon - and must follow the rules. He added: “This is not something that any country will be able to manage in a matter of weeks. We are going to have to work out a strategy and approach to managing this virus over months.”  It comes as Brits are urged to heed warnings that they should stay at home over the warm Easter weekend. There were encouraging signs on Thursday that the public were largely following the strict guidelines, with traffic levels showing an absence of a mass weekend getaway. The government has launched a publicity drive urging people to stay in their homes - including Easter eggs foil-wrapped with the words STAY HOME, SAVE LIVES.

That boils down to:Shopping for basic necessities, for example food and medicine, which must be as infrequent as possible One form of exercise a day, for example a run, walk, or cycle - alone or with members of your household Any medical need, including to donate blood, avoid or escape risk of injury or harm, or to provide care or to help a vulnerable person Travelling for work purposes, but only where you cannot work from home. Gatherings of more than two people are banned in public - unless youaposre from the same household, or a few other exceptions . And pubs, cafes, restaurants, gyms, funfairs, playgrounds, sports courts, cinemas, theatres, nightclubs, bingo halls, concert halls, museums, galleries, car showrooms, casinos, betting shops, spas, hair and beauty salons, barbers, massage parlours, tattoo studios, skating rinks and more must shut.  What is the punishment for breaking the lockdown  Breaking the rules above without reasonable excuse, or obstructing an officer enforcing them, is a criminal offence and you can be prosecuted. However, you can in most cases avoid a criminal conviction by paying a aposfixed penalty noticeapos issued by the police within  days. The law allows police to issue £ fixed penalty notices - rising to £ for a second offence and then doubling each time up to a cap of £. Police, PCSOs, council officers and other government representatives can also order or force you toto your home, and disperse gatherings of more than two people.  When did the UK go into lockdown - and for how long  The lockdown was announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday  March. It took effect immediately. Police powers to enforce the lockdown took force a few days later - at pm on Thursday  March. The law says the lockdown must be reviewed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock every three weeks, with the first review by Thursday  April. But reviewing the lockdown doesnapost mean it stops. The law is in force for up to six months without the government needing to write a new one. Will the lockdown be extended for longer than three weeks  Yes. The UK government hasnapost made an official announcement because thataposll only come next week. But ministers, civil servants and  Downing Street have been absolutely clear that April  is much too soon to end the lockdown. Wales has already confirmed it will extend the lockdown. Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon added: I don’t think there is any possibility, any likelihood of these lockdown measures being lted immediately or even imminently. Even before a COBRA meeting to discuss the lockdown, Downing Street basically confirmed the UK government agrees with Ms Sturgeon.  Why isnapost the extension being announced properly today  Because the government wants to wait to see how well the restrictions are working at reducing cases. A formal announcement will be made on or before April , based on scientic evidence. Whoaposll make the decision  Technically itaposs made by Health Secretary Matt Hancock but itaposll be overseen by Boris Johnsonaposs stand-in, Dominic Raab. Not the PM, whoaposs in intensive care. Downing Street said: The Prime Minister is not working. I think weaposre very clear on that. And he has asked the First Secretary of State to deputise for him. It will be the First Secretary of State who leads the COBRA meeting [on Thursday] and the First Secretary of State who will lead any cabinet decision making process.  So can I go out for a picnic this Easter weekend then  No, absolutely not. Yes, the lockdown is being reviewed, but that absolutely does not mean it has stopped. You may only go outside your home with a reasonable excuse - just like any other day under lockdown. When will the lockdown end  We donapost know. But it will only be lted when the UK is well over the peak of new Covid- cases per day, and thataposs not any time soon. Ministers had hoped the peak would be Easter Sunday but estimates now put it at least a week or two later. Even then, cases have to drastically dwindle too. Otherwise thereaposll just be a second outbreak. The UK government has also repeatedly refused to say what its aposexitapos strategy is. Until we get a vaccine next year, itaposs quite possible they just donapost know yet. Officials havenapost ruled out a partial end to the lockdown, where some people can go outside earlier than others. Or restrictions being lted for a few weeks, then reimposed.  Are even stricter restrictions on the way  Not right now, no. The government hasnapost ruled out making the rules even stricter - such as banning exercise. But No emphasised the focus is on policing the current rules more strictly, not making new ones. Boris Johnsonaposs spokesman said: I think the focus for now is ensuring that people continue to stick by the measures weaposve put in place. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden warned the government may enhance or change the lockdown, but thataposs not happening right now. No said: Weaposve always said thatthe scientic advice suggested other steps are needed weaposd be prepared to take them. But for now our focus is on ensuring the steps we already have in place are properly enforced. What does the law actually say  The lockdown is enforced through a law called the Health Protection Regulations . Importantly, it isnapost exactly the same as the government guidance. You should of course follow both, but it makes a dference to whether police can stop you going about your business. Here we go through a few common situations. Whataposs the full list of aposreasonable excusesapos for leaving my house  Reasonable excuses include, but it appears are not limited to:To obtain basic necessities, including food and medical supplies for those in the same householdor for vulnerable persons To take exercise either alone or with other members of their household To seek medical assistance To provide care or assistance to a vulnerable person, or to provide emergency assistance To donate blood To travel for the purposes of work or to provide voluntary or charitable services, where it is not reasonably possible for that person to work from home To attend a funeral of a member of the person’s household, a close family member, orneither are attending, a friend To fulfil a legal obligation, including attending court or satisfying bail conditions To access critical public services, including childcare school, social services, DWP services, victims of crime services To allow children with shared custody to move between each parentaposs house For a minister of religion, to go to their place of worship To move house where reasonably necessary To avoid injury or illness or to escape a risk of harm.When can more than two people gather in public  Exceptions to the rule are:Where all the people in the gathering are members of the same household Where the gathering is essential for work purposes To attend a funeral To facilitate a house move* To provide emergency assistance* To fulfil a legal obligation* To provide care to a vulnerable person** Where reasonably necessary. Can police fine meI exercise twice in one day  No. Government guidance is clear - you should only exercise once a day. You should follow this advice. But the law itself doesnapost specy how many times you can go out. It just says you may take exerciseyou need to. Meanwhile, guidance has been updated to let people with a medical need go out multiple times a day, for instance people with learning disabilities or autism.  Can police stop me sitting in the park  Yes,you canapost provide a reasonable excuse. You wonapost be surprised to hear the list of possible reasonable excuses does not include sitting, having a picnic or sunbathing - evenyouaposre doing it with proper social distancing. Police have of course been asked to show discretion, and there are exceptions in the rules for people with a medical need. Can police go through my shopping  The law isnapost % clear - but the Home Secretary has said itaposs not appropriate. It comes after a police force threatened to go through peopleaposs bags to check for non-essential items. After an outcry, Northamptonshire Police later claried: We absolutely will NOT be searching peopleaposs shopping trolleys in Northamptonshire. Home Secretary Priti Patel later said this is not appropriate and branded it heavy-handed. So thataposs all good. But what does the law say  The law says you can go out to buy basic necessities, including food and medical supplies. So you might interpret that asyou start buying non-essential items, youaposre breaking the law. But the government also says open shops donapost have to pull all their non-essential items from stock. So Sainsburyaposs can carry on selling, say, kidsapos toys and paddling pools - and thereaposs nothing to stop you buying them. Shops that are still open are free to sell any items that they have in stock, Downing Street told us. Yet Downing Street also told us: When we ask the police to carry out enforcement of any rules we give them discretion on how to do that. Thataposs the nature of policing in the UK. They have set out in guidance to officers that they should engage, explain, encourage and then finally enforce.

Everyone understands the importance of supporting doctors, nurses and other staff on the frontline. That is why you came out in your millions again last night to applaud our  brilliant national health service. But the battle against the pandemic is not just being fought in our hospitals and surgeries. In the scramble to shore up the NHS, the Government appears to have neglected the half a million people in care homes. These residents are almost exclusively in the high-risk category. Yet care home operators say they have been ignored and are struggling to get the help they need. Many are short of staff because workers have had to go into self-isolation. Others desperately want personal protection equipment such as face masks and gloves. One home in Luton has reported that  of its residents have died and tragically there are more cases emerging across the country. Without urgent action more lives will be lost. We cannot allow these homes, offering comfort and support, to turn into death traps. Break traditionThe Easter break is traditionally a time for worship and for friends and familiesto come together.A time when children enjoy Easter Egg hunts and many head for the country or coast. With good weather in many parts, the temptation to break the lockdown restrictions will be strong. But we urge you to stay home.

According to a local woman, the campers arrived on Thursday at pm and set up a apossix-manapos tent, the Liverpool Echo reports.Gaynor Kingsley said: A young couple, arrived about pm I think, they parked opposite the houses and started to set up their tent - it was massive, probably a six-man tent so my husband says. Our neighbours were already out looking at them when I went out to see them. Gaynoraposs stunned husband called Merseyside Police to report the couple for ignoring the aposstay home, protect the NHS and save livesapos rule. Gaynor said: This was a totally unnecessary action, you can’t even sunbathe in a field for goodness sake, and the police said they would send a team to investigate when they were available. I saw two sets of dog walkers take out their phones to photograph them, and many of my neighbours photographed them as well. Gaynor said the couple decided to leave after realising they had received a frosty welcome from locals.  She said: They started to pack the tent away at about .pm, it may have been their intention to just try it out, to practise erecting it, but I think all the gasping from the neighbours was a factor that hurried them away.

OK, I’ve only had three weeks of it and, unlike Jesus, I’ve been able to eat and drink, although Satan is tempting me every afternoon to sup unholy spirits. The gospels don’t say exactly what He did to kill time in lockdown in the Judean desert, but I’m guessing he pledged to do a lot of things, and failed. That’s my story. I told myself I’d re-discover books, but whenever I got a few pages into one I’d hear an alert on my phone, look away, spend half an hour scrolling, and realise all literature is doomedit exceeds  characters. I tried to learn how to cook something new to add to the one dish a week I make, but my paella stuck to the pan and I lashed it into the bin when one of the kids laughed and askedit was called a paella crap. I grew a beard, which I thought made me look a bit like Al Pacino in Serpico, only for my we to tell me I looked like Jon Pertwee in Worzel Gummidge. I decided to put a coat of nish on the rotting garden furniture but the three paint brushes I had were glued together with old paint, and when I drove to BQ, they turned me away because I hadn’t worked out how to click and collect from them. I never will. So I turned to Netflix, hoping to get hooked on a new American drama or documentary series and got so bored I ended up scouring US news channels to find a Donald Trump press conference for some mental stimulation.  And then a week ago I did something that finally beat the lockdown blues. I dug out my old DVD box sets and started to re-watch comedy classics. I devoured The Office, delighting again at Ricky Gervais’s glorious anti-PC creation David Brent. I stuck on Fawlty Towers and remembered how funny John Cleese used to be before he became a real-le whining malcontent. Watching the greatest political satire ever, The Thick Of It, left me marvelling at the master of the four-lettered insult Malcolm Tucker."},{"url":null,"title":"brits ignore lockdown measures buy","story":"NewsBrits ignore lockdown measures to buy ice cream and sit on beach in Good Friday sunshinePolice were seen approaching people appearing to float the rules on Brighton Beach while runners, walkers and cyclists were seen filling crowded pathways in Windsor Park despite repeated warningsShareCommentsByAbigail OLeary:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video public-urged-stay-home-despite-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,codesplit:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,nocodesplit:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,mvtTests:[ UJ- ],webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,lotameLightningTagV:true,prebid.sendAllBids:true,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,ozoneAllowedKeys:oz_gmpd_crid,oz_gmpd,oz_gmpd_adid,oz_winner,oz_gmpd_adomain,oz_gmpd_pb_r,oz_gmpd_adv,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,webPushNotications.pushDisplayService:airship,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news brits-ignore-lockdown-measures-buy-\"\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters.

Queues were spotted on the seafront outside an ice cream kiosk in the popular seaside resort as UK temperatures hit C. And where in the country runners, walkers and cyclists were seen filling crowded pathways in Windsor Great Park, with little apparent regard for social distancing guidance.It comes just  hours after Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, standing in for the Prime Minister, urged the country to stringently stick to lockdown measures to help save lives and protect the NHS.He urged the public to think “long and hard” about the impact on heroic NHS staffthey ignored the rules.Follow all coronavirus updates here in our live blog“After all the efforts everybody has made, after all the sacrices so many people have made let’s not ruin it now,” Mr Raab said. “Let’s not undo the gains we’ve made, let’s not waste the sacrices so many people have made. We mustn’t give the coronavirus a second chance to kill more people and to hurt our country.” Apologising that people would not be able to spend time with their families over Easter he added: “The deaths are still rising. It’s too early to lt the measures that we put in place.” Ministers launched a Stay at Home This Easter publicity drive designed to make sunseekers think twice.Police in parts of the country have also been ramping up patrols of beaches and beauty spots, with using sea-water to dampen peopleaposs beach barbecues. The Devon  Cornwall force also said it would be patrolling the M motorway on the Somerset and Devon border to keep tourists away from the area.Military Defence Police, based in Portsmouth and Plymouth, will be operating along the coastlines in Dorset, Devon and Cornall to ensure people aposdo not gather unnecessarilyapos,  reported i news  on Thursday evening.Today, experts have said continuing the lockdown for several weeks is not unreasonable.  Professor Paul Cosford said: “I think several weeks isn’t unreasonable. Let’s hope its sooner than that,” he told BBC Radio ’s Today programme. “All my experience dealing with any sort of infectious disease suggests once you start getting things under control, that is the time you absolutely need to continue with all your measures so you can bring the disease right down, essentially to crack it across the country.” He said the restrictions could be lted in stages. “I could conceive of circumstances in which some of the restrictions are lted sooner and some are lted later,” he said.

Now is the time we can start to see mammals and their newborns pop their heads above ground. Today Chris Packham and zoologist Megan McCubbin talk about their favourite British mammals to keep your eyes peeled for in April and May. Badgers  Badgers are active throughout the course of the year and would’ve given birth in February or March, so in the next couple of weeks the young might be coming above ground for the first time. But they’ve very shy. They live in setts in the middle of the large territory that belongs to the whole family. The main sett is where the badgers live for most of the year and where they rear their babies but they also have smaller setts which they use in the Spring, Summer and Autumn so they can sleep near to where they find food.  A family of badgers can have a really big territory - each badger terrirtory might have up to six smaller setts. They’re sociable animals and like living with each other and love to play. And they’re really good at knowing which territory is theirs by their latrines - badgers have really distinct smelling faeces which they put at the edge of their territories so other families know they shouldn’t enter. It’s quite a sophisticated set up and is essential to their survival. Bats  We have  species of bat in the UK,  of which are known to be breeding here - that’s almost a quarter of our mammal species. They’re emerging this time of year and you can see them in all areas - urban or rural. But bats are always betteryou’ve got water near you. Soyou’re near a pond, reservoir, anything like that, you’ll see they’re beginning to emerge regularly. Bat populations have suffered severe declines during the past century. Deer  We had a muntjac deer near us the other day. You can tell the dference between male and female because the males have two very distinctive dark lines down the forehead and have very short antlers. The females are slightly paler. Muntjac have these amazing curved bottoms like rabbits. They are quite pig like with very sticky legs and are one of my favourites. They’re not native to the UK and were brought here in  to Woburn Safari Park. Some of them escaped, which is why they’re quite common across woodlands in the south of England. They’re very shy and secretive animals, soyou get a glimpse make the most of it. They’re fascinating, you can see them on roadsides nibbling at the verges. But they aren’t too popular with gardeners because they go for all the tasty parts of your plants - they love rosebuds. Also just be waryyou’re out walking your dog in an area where they might be and keep your animal on a lead. Foxes  April is the time we would expect start to see our fox cubs and they start to move around out of their den. If people are lucky enough to have a den in their garden shed, this is when they’ll first see the fox cubs. They’re very unfoxy when you first see them, they have quite blunt faces with short ears. They look quite cat-like, like kittens the nose hasn’t grown down yet and they’re chocolate brown in colour, they’re not red yet. Wobbling about with their skinny tails, they try to find their balance. We’ve already had reports of that cubs have been sighted as early as Christmas and January. This is really early, which is a sign of climate change. Fellow Springwatch presenter, Iolo Williams, told me he saw very young fox cubs and that was just before or after Christmas. That’s quite unusual. Otters  Pre s, where a lot of chemicals were put into our waterways, many of them were devoid of le and it damaged the eco systems. Everything at the top of the food chain disappeared. Otters only really occurred on the western side of the UK, in Wales, Cornwall and Devon. When I was a kid in the s, otters were a rather rare animal they were dficult to see and it didn’t occur in Hampshire where I grew up. Now they have recovered their range and have been found in every UK county, all the way across from the west and now including Kent. But they have not recovered their numbers, so there’s still scope for more otters to exist in our environment, particularly now our waterways have been cleaned up. We can’t be complacent about otter conservation just because they’re back everywhere - they’re not back in numbers they were, but it’s great to see them turning up. In urban areas they have even been turning up and you can see them in daytime from footpaths. Otters were almost an enigma and now are mostly accessible. The Sainsbury’s supermarket in Andover has a path that runs alongside the river and while you’re pushing your trolley you can look over the side and see them. How to make a hedgehog house and highway  Hedgehogs are a favourite this time of year - everyone loves hedgehogs. It’s mild and now’s the time they’re coming out into the garden soyou have a trap camera, now is the time to set it up. You can also make a little hedgehog house which is really simple. Get a bucket, put some hay or straw, grass, any long organic matter, inside the bucket, just something the hedgehog can hide in. Lie the bucket on its side and keep it steady with something so it doesn’t roll. Put it under a hedge or somewhere not exposed – they’re very secretive and shy things and are much more comfortable when they feel secure.

Barred from working, she has no means of earning extra cash to help support her young daughter. She said the toddler is constantly in tears, unable to grasp why she has to stay indoors. And when Fuligdi does go out, she finds it impossible to provide for her - having to pick between food and medicines during the worst health crisis in modern times. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror The government is facing calls to help asylum seekers through the crisis by increasing support by £ a week. Fuligdi said the lockdown has brought back harrowing memories of the abuse she suffered after being detained in an army camp in her native Sri Lanka. The mum, who now lives in a room in a house in Liverpool, said that the lockdown is taking a huge toll on herself and her daughter.  She revealed: The television is broken and she hasnapost many toys - they are too expensive for us. She is sad and crying – she wants to be outside with other children and so do I but of course we canapost go out and she is too young to understand why we must stay here. And describing the challenges of making do with such a small allowance, she said: As an asylum seeker waiting status I get around £ a day for myself and a little more for my daughter so money is very tight.  We just manage but now it is much more dficult. The local shops have increased their prices – what used to be £ now costs £ – and nappies are very hard to find. The ones in the smaller shops are too expensive for us. The crisis has left Fuligdi feeling upset and isolated, as she has been forced to stop attending therapy sessions and English classes. And she said being forced to remain inside is bringing back horric memories of the torture she suffered after her  arrest, after being accused of supporting anti-government rebels.  Fuligdi, from a Tamil family who was arrested following the war between the government and rebel LTTE, said: I have been badly affected by the torture and abuse I experienced. I canapost forget what what happened to me. Night time is the worst – all the memories come back. Lockdown makes it worse. Before we could go outside and socialise. Now we are stuck inside. I am depressed and afraid I will catch Coronavirus. How would I cope then  She fled Sri Lanka five years ago, and is still waiting for an asylum decision. The mum said: The long wait and the uncertainity affects my physical and mental health. I want to stay here and live in safety with my daughter but I canapost until my refugee status is granted. She has been supported by charity Freedom from Torture, which provides a vital leline for those who suffered shocking abuse.The organisation has launched a petition, which says: No one should have to choose between medicine, food, or protection at a time like this. After Universal Credit allowances were increased to help struggling families through the crisis, the heads of more than  organisations called on the government to do the same for those reliant on asylum allowances."},{"url":null,"title":"doctor says 5g isnt spreading","story":"NewsDoctor says G isnt spreading coronavirus and labels conspiracy theories impossibleNHS GP Dr Gero Baiarda has said the conspiracy theories linking coronavirus with G are scientically incorrect as he addresses and breaks down the most common claimsShareCommentsByLuke MatthewsAudience Writer:,  APR NewsDr Gero Baiarda has broken down the conspiracy theories \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWe will use your email address to send you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor more information on how we use your data and your data protection rights.Thank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email A conspiracy theory claiming G wireless communication technology is responsible for causing the coronavirus crisis has been widely shared online. Social media bosses have been urged to do more to crack down on the aposcrazedapos theory after two G masts were torched, while YouTube has moved to ban all videos ly claiming  aposG causes coronavirusapos. One doctor has now spoken out against the conspiracy theory to say it is aposimpossibleapos to link G to the outbreak of Covid-, as reported by Wales Online.NHS GP Dr Gero Baiarda has launched a aposmyth-bustingapos series, addressing issues about the pandemic, and says the G theory is aposscientically incorrectapos and should be treated as fake news.Dr Baiarda, who works at online GP-on-demand service GPDQ, responds to some of the most common theories related to G.Theory one: G suppresses the immune system so much that it allows you to catch the coronavirus easily.Dr Baiarda : No, it doesn’t. G radio waves are very inert low frequency waves that have no discernible effect on human beings.He says G radio waves do not carry enough energy to causes harm and research has demonstrated this aposbeyond reasonable doubtapos, adding: The waves emitted from your microwave oven are more powerful than G – both are perfectly safe. G occupies the same waves as those previously used by analogue TV. Therefore, claiming that G waves will weaken your immune system to the point that you are defenceless against Covid- is like saying that the old-fashioned TV signals caused pandemics. We lived with them for more than  years, and they clearly did not. He states immune systems can be compromised by other co-existing health conditions, such as diabetes or asthma, and it will also naturally decline as you get older. A large number of people affected by the virus have been elderly or those with existing health conditions, and the GP states their levels of exposure to G waves have not been a factor.  Theory two:  The virus can travel on G waves and invade the human body.Dr Baiarda:No, it can’t. There are only very specic sites in the human body where the virus can invade and start to make you ill.To enter the human body, the virus needs to be absorbed by receptors predominantly found in our eyes, noses and mouths. There are also receptors deep down in the lungs - for the G theory to be true, the virus would have to somehow hitch a ride on these very specic low frequency waves, which is impossible, before making their way like guided missiles into your eyes, nose or mouth. All viruses, including the SARS-Cov- virus , decay relatively rapidlythey do not find a host. It is not possible for them to be transferred by G over even short distances, let alone over cities, lakes and rivers, through walls and into you. Dr Baiarda says the virus is transferred effectively from person to person which is why we are advised to use social distancing, and has no way of moving on itaposs own. He added that research by ICNIRPpublished earlier his year found no evidence between waves used by mobile networks and cancer or any other illness.  Theory three: G masts are killing smaller animals including birds.Dr Baiarda: No, they are not. If birds appear to be impacted by G masts, it might be because AM radio signals and the very weak electromagnetic fields produced by the equipment interfere with the animalsapos aposinternal compassapos.He cited a study by Professor Henrik Mouritsen from the University of Oldenburg in Germany, which found birds use the earthaposs magnetic field to help them navigate. Experiments revealed that birds exposed to electromagnetic aposnoiseapos between kHz and MHz lost all sense of direction, but found their way again when it was blocked out.

Long lines snaked through car parks on Good Friday as customers were forced to stay at least two metres apart and stores limited the number of people allowed inside due to social distancing rules. With many stores closed on Sunday, queues at some shops formed an hour before they opened and had hundreds of customers, and some shoppers said they gave up or didnapost bother at all because the wait was so long. Britons are facing an unprecedented Easter bank holiday weekend thanks to the Covid- pandemic and a lockdown that is now in its third week and set to be extended. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. A Twitter user in West Sussex wrote: @Tesco Iaposve just been speaking to someone who has just finished a  hour sht on a Covid ward. She is in a -hour queue to get into your Crawley store. She is not allowed to jump the queue. How is that OK A Tesco worker replied: Although we ask our security to stick to the rules, we would also expect them to use common sense in times like these and let them through. I will contact the storeyou let me know which one it is. A man in Birmingham wrote: Queues at the supermarkets this weekend are giving me anxiety!  Looked like - hour+ queues at Asda and Sainsbury’s near me. Hope it’s just for Easter weekend and normal service resumes shortly. A woman in London wrote: Thank goodness I donapost need any more shopping now until next week.  Itaposs literally taken  hours to get a few essential bits in my local Sainsburyaposs and Waitrose. The last time I saw queues that long, I was outside Madame Tussauds during the school holidays. And another added: Waited in a queue at the butchers for way over an hour, all because I wanted lamb for Easter.A woman in Scotland tweeted: Well folk seem determined to aposovershotapos for Easter. The queue is all the way round our local Tesco’s very large car park #GoodsFriday. Photos posted on social media showed queues stretching well into car parks where barriers were set up to keep things orderly. In Cwmbran in South Wales, a man who posted a photo of shoppers waiting to enter an Aldi wrote: Queue for Aldi is insane mind.  Pictures showed shoppers queing in a car park outside an Asda in Brighton, East Sussex, long lines outside a Morrisons in Seaburn, South Tyneside, and similar scenes at a Sainsburyaposs store in Heaton, Newcastle. Shoppers told to expect long queues Families have been warned that queues to get into supermarkets might be even longer than usual on Saturday, as a result of Sunday trading laws. Shops in England and Wales - but not Scotland - have to shut their doors on Easter Sunday and Christmas daytheyaposre over  square metres in size.  And these rules apply coronavirus or not - meaning even more families than usual will need to stock up on essentials this Saturday. To make matters even worse, Friday and Monday count as Sundays thanks to their bank holiday status over Easter - meaning big shops are operating reduced hours on those days too. Throw coronavirus restrictions on the number of people allowed into shops at once and you have a recipe for the mother of all queues.  On a normal Sunday big shops can open for six hours, between am and pm. This weekend, those restrictions apply to Friday and Monday, while shops over a certain size must close entirely on Sunday. Then there are additional hours reductions as a result of coronavirus. Some shops are closing earlier so staff have more time to restock shelves. Police face criticism for patrolling supermarkets A police force is facing criticism after its officers patrolled a Tesco and found that the non-essential aisles were empty. Cambridgeshire Police officers visited the supermarket just a day after Northamptonshireaposs chief constable faced a backlash for suggesting officers could search shopping trolleyspeople kept flouting social distancing rules.

Hull Live reports that although the -year-old hasnapost been tested, she says she is certain she has had the disease because itaposs the most ill she has been in her le. Sian revealed the cough didnapost come until day eight of feeling unwell - and she didnapost get a fever at all. She says she has no idea where and how she caught it. She said: I only started keeping a diary of symptoms on my social media because I wanted to keep a record of it - these are strange times and itaposs easy to forget when you look back in future years. Have you got a coronavirus story  Email webnews@mirror I started a few days into the illness and had a lot of friends come forward and say they had similar symptoms. Like me, they didnapost feel serious enough to ask for medical help but were bad enough for it to put them in bed for at least a few days. A lot of people have told me they appreciated seeing my little symptom updates as they could identy with what I was going through, or knew what to look out for.Here, she explains her symptoms in her own words: Day One - Wednesday, March  The first symptoms were muscle aches and tiredness, I just felt under the weather and exhausted. Day Two - Thursday, March Felt much worse, the same symptoms as day one.    Day Three - Friday, March Those symptoms became much worse and I could barely get out of bed. It felt like a really bad flu, where it completely exhausts you. I started with a terrible headache today. I also had a very heavy feeling in my chest which made me short of breath. Even walking downstairs felt like a huge effort and I needed lots of rest. Iaposm a regular runner and pretty fit with no lung complaints, so that was a big shock for me.Day four - Saturday, March The headache was at its peak today and I lost my sense of taste and smell.The headache felt excruciating and nothing seemed to help, not even painkillers. It was in my sinuses, behind my eyes, my teeth and jaw and across my temples. It actually felt really scary as I donapost usually have headaches.I started Googling symptoms at that point because although I suspected Covid - due to flu symptoms and shortness of breath - I didnapost know loss of taste and smell, headaches and fatigue were also being recognised as symptoms in other countries who were ahead of ours in the timeline.Day Five - Sunday, March Similar to day four. I was really frustrated with the advice in the UK at that point. It was just about fever and cough, not really anything  - I thought I was going mad at one point.Day Six and Day Seven - March  and Those main symptoms of exhaustion, headache, loss of appetite and taste and smell, and shortness of breath continued all this week. I was struggling to be able to gather my thoughts enough to work. Like when you have flu, my brain felt foggy and I couldnapost concentrate. I didnapost leave the house even to go into the garden for pretty much a week, I didnapost have the energy. Itaposs definitely worse than compared to cold and flu in the past. I knew I could manage the symptoms with rest, paracetamol and fluids but itaposs the most ill Iaposve ever been. Day eight to day Much less fatigues, headache has gone Muscles getting back to normalStill have a sore throat Chest feeling phlegmy and started to cough Very little appetite and upset stomach Still have  per cent lack of taste and smell No feverDay  - Monday, April Almost back to normal, except chest is still too weak to exercise. Still no taste or sense of smell Tire easilyDay  - Tuesday, April Still tire easily. Nothing like being ill to make you grateful for what you haveDay  - Wednesday, April The headache started to lt - but shortness of breath remained, and two weeks on, I can still feel the dference.   Day  - Thursday, April I feel very lucky to be on the mend. Iaposm looking forward to the small things - like being able to go for a run or walk without being short of breath, being able to smell flowers or perfume and taste food again. Mrs Alexander said sheaposs grateful she is over the worst of the virus. She said: Iaposm still not up to going for a run - I get very short of breath by the end of the day and donapost want to push it. My kids have had sore throats and snfles but nowhere near as bad, thankfully.

Restaurants, pubs and theatres are now closed, along with schools, and people are being told to only leave their homes when they have to get essential supplies, like medicine and food, or for exercise daily. Group gatherings are now totally banned with people being told to stay six feet away from others at all times. The elderly, who are especially at risk to infection from coronavirus, are among the group of the most vulnerable who have been told they must self-isolate for  weeks in a bid to keep them safe. But this can be an incredibly lonely experience for OAPs, who are unable to spend time with their loved ones or socialise.And now  people living with dementia who are separated from their families in the Coronavirus lockdown have explained how music has become a leline in keeping them connected.Moyra Tourlamain, , lives at home with her husband John, , who was diagnosed with dementia in . They have had to stay away from family and friends but have found solace in online music sessions via the Music for Dementia  campaign. Moyra said: John and I have always been into music – in fact one of the reasons I married him was for his record collection! It’s played a big part in our le and still does. Before the Covid- pandemic they would attend music classes designed to help people with dementia in their local area near Cambridge. But although John has missed out on the face-to-face connection, his symptoms – which have been heightened recently due to the isolation – have been alleviated by attending online versions of the sessions. Former BBC bureaucrat Moyra said: As Hans Christian Andersen famously said, aposwhere words fail, music speaksapos. The online sessions have been a leline not just for John but for me. They are a landmark in what are very long weeks. I think it’s really important for our general wellbeing. It’s also a whole new experience and the engagement with the computer is important for John. It’s really good to see everybody, to connect and make the music together. There are hundreds of thousands of people who are in the same boat as us who might feel lonely and isolated and their conditions may have got worse as a result. We’d urge them to go onto the Music for Dementia  website and find out how to make the most of music during this time.  Music for Dementia  – a campaign backed by broadcaster Lauren Laverne to get more access to music for the , people living with dementia in the UK – has launched a new Musical Guide for those experiencing heightened anxiety during the lockdown. And more and more people are now using Music for Dementia ’s Musical Map, which gives information about online services for those with dementia, as well as taking advantage of Dementia Discos and live streamed events. It comes amid reports that UK care homes are in danger of being overwhelmed by the coronavirus with staff warning they are at “breaking point”. Lauren Laverne said: We’ve already seen how music has played a vital role in keeping people’s spirits up across the world during isolation. It echoes exactly what the Music for Dementia  campaign has been saying - although the feeling of isolation is an ongoing situation for people with this condition. For people living with dementia, music is a leline to connect in a way that nothing  can. Don Leitch, , of Royston, Hertfordshire, has been living with dementia for seven years and has been separated from his daughter, Caroline, due to the coronavirus. Caroline, , would see her dad at least once a week before the lockdown and pick him up from his home to accompany him to weekly music sessions run by a local group Together In Sound. She said: Music therapy is one of the very few positive things added to his le since being diagnosed with dementia. My dad has lost a lot but this one positive thing that has been added, and brought us closer together. In the car on the way there, I’ll play the music he likes listening to. He loves The Shadows. Caroline explained they are join each other and other people living with dementia for online sessions – which have been just as much of a relief to her as it has to her dad. Many music organisations have already made their services available digitally and these are being added to Music for Dementia ’s digital Musical Map, an advice hub of virtual events and activities that people living with dementia can participate in. Examples of online music events include The London Symphony Orchestra, now streaming online-concerts and The Sofa Singers, a new weekly online event which sees  people come together for a -minute rehearsal where they learn a classic song and sing it together. Music for Dementia  is urging music services that are moving online to get in touch, so they can be added to Musical Map.

The group, made up of seven men in their s and s and three women in their s had arranged travel from London to Cannes. They were to due to land a private jet at Marseille-Provence airport before trying to access the villa by helicopter. However, the unnamed rich holiday makers were stopped in their tracks and intercepted by police during their journey on Saturday. The private jet was an Embraer Legacy – a Brazil made luxury business jet. When confronted by police, a Ukraine businessman offered them cash, saying: I have money, let’s talk, said the police source. A source said the Ukrainian had paid for everything, including the villa and plane, was looking forward to the break, with his friends and young female escorts. Follow all coronavirus updates here on our live blog The source added: He said they all go to the villa, and lockdown there, and that there would be no problem. ‘But it was obviously a recreational trip, and under the containment measures these are strictly prohibited. A police source told the BFM news outlet: They had planned to come and have a good time on the Riviera despite the coronavirus epidemic. Everything had been planned by the organiser of the trip – a Croatian national who works in finance and real estate – starting with the London-Marseille trip in a private jet that he had rented on the other side of the Channel. He then booked a luxury villa in Cannes. To get there, the man had reserved three helicopters from a company in the Var which provides private connections for privileged customers. Commercial flights are greatly reduced at airports across Europe at the moment, and the authorities are trying to stop private jets breaking restrictions. The source reported that police guarding the borders of Marseille-Provence airport asked the private jet not to come and land on its tarmac. But the plane still landed anyway, and the passengers, aged between between  and  years for the women, and  and  for the men, were not allowed to get off the aircraft.  Controlled by the border police and the gendarmerie of air transport, none had valid reasons for traveling, said the source. Crossing borders is only allowed with a legitimate or compelling reason, he added. The travellers from London included German, French, Romanian, Croatian and Ukrainian nationals, said the source. They initially argued with police, and expressed anger when three helicopters waiting for them were ordered to leave empty, and their pilots fined for breaking lockdown restrictions.

Before burial, the dead are wrapped in body bags and placed inside pine caskets. The deceasedaposs name is scrawled in large letters on each casket, which helps should a body need to be disinterred later.  They are buried in long narrow trenches excavated by digging machines.  They added two new trenches in case we need them, Mr Kersten said. To help with the surge contract laborers have been hired, he said. For social distancing and safety reasons, city-sentenced people in custody are not assisting in burials for the duration of the pandemic, Mr Kersten said. A barge could be seen arriving at the island on Thursday morning with a refrigerated truck aboard containing about two dozen bodies.

Covid- is believed to have mutated into three distinct strains - Type A, B and C. The original one - Type A - that was identied in Wuhan, China, is now thought to be sweeping the US, with New York now having more casesthan any country. England and Europe is believed to be battling Type C. Researchers from Cambridge University reconstructed the early path of Covid- as infection spread from Wuhan, China, in December out to Europe and North America. It shows that type A - the original virus most closely related to the virus found in both bats and pangolins - was not Chinaaposs most common. Instead Type A is now prevalent in Australia and the US.Follow the latest coronavirus updates in our live blog.China was mainly hit by Type B, which was in circulation as far back as Christmas Eve. It is believed this type mutates slowly through China, but rapidly outside China. Type B is derived from A, separated by two mutations, then C is in turn a daughter of B, the study suggests. A total of  NHS trusts in England have announced at least  deaths to date, according to figures from NHS England.As of pm on April , the totals are:- University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust: - London North West University Healthcare NHS Trust: - Kingaposs College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust: - Barts Health NHS Trust: - Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust: - University Hospitals of Derby  Burton NHS Foundation Trust: - Croydon Health Services NHS Trust: - St Georgeaposs University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust: - Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust: - The Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust: - Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust: - Epsom  St Helier University Hospitals NHS Trust: - Lewisham  Greenwich NHS Trust: - Sandwell  West Birmingham Hospitals NHS Trust: - North Middlesex University Hospital NHS Trust: - The Dudley Group NHS Foundation Trust: - Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust: - South Tyneside  Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust:   Type C may have spread to Europe via Singapore. The findings are published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . Dr Peter Forster, geneticist and lead author from the University of Cambridge, said: There are too many rapid mutations to neatly trace a Covid- family tree. We used a mathematical network algorithm to visualise all the plausible trees simultaneously. These techniques are mostly known for mapping the movements of prehistoric human populations through DNA.We think this is one of the first times they have been used to trace the infection routes of a coronavirus like Covid-. Experts believe the virus, called SARS-CoV-, is mutating to overcome immune system resistance in dferent populations. Researchers found that the closest type of coronavirus to the one discovered in bats - type A, the original human virus genome - was present in Wuhan, but was not the cityaposs predominant virus type. Mutated versions of A were seen in Americans reported to have lived in Wuhan, and a large number of A-type viruses were found in patients from the US and Australia. The coronavirus lockdown is a worrying time for millions across the UK. But itaposs also bringing out the best in people who are selflessly giving their time each day to help those most in need.

Wuhanaposs major virus type was B and prevalent in patients from across east Asia, however it didnapost travel much beyond the region without further mutations. The researchers say the C iant is the major European type, found in early patients from France, Italy, Sweden and England. It is absent from the studyaposs Chinese mainland sample but seen in Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea. The analysis also suggests one of the earliest introductions of the virus into Italy came via the first documented German infection on January , and that another early Italian infection route was related to a Singapore cluster.

South Korean health officials said it remains unclear what is behind the trend, with epidemiological investigations still under way. The prospect of people being re-infected with the virus is of international concern, as many countries are hoping that infected populations will develop sufficient immunity to prevent a resurgence of the pandemic. The South Korean figure had risen from  such cases on Monday. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror Nearly , South Koreans have been reported as recovered from Covid-, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. The number will only increase,  is just the beginning now, said Kim Woo-joo, professor of infectious diseases at Korea University Guro Hospital. The KCDCaposs Jeong raised the possibility that rather than patients being re-infected, the virus may have been reactivated. Kim also said patients had likely relapsed rather than been re-infected. False test results could also be at fault, other experts said, or remnants of the virus could still be in patientsapos systems but not be infectious or of danger to the host or others.  There are dferent interpretations and many iables, said Jung Ki-suck, professor of pulmonary medicine at Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital. The government needs to come up with responses for each of these iables. South Korea on Friday reported  new cases, its lowest after daily cases peaked at more than  in late February, according to KCDC, adding the total stood at , cases. The death toll rose by seven to , it said. The city of Daegu, which endured the first large coronavirus outbreak outside of China, reported zero new cases for the first time since late February.

I was free to talk to clubs.“I spoke to Mark McGhee at Motherwell and Gus MacPherson at St Mirren.“The chance to go to England and play for that club [Coventry] came up and it was a no-brainer really.“My agent and I sat down…we didn’t need to think about it.“There were other reasons why it was more beneficial for me – you’re trying to make a living in your career.“I had three top-flight teams up here who I had the chance to go to.“Lee Wilkie was at Dundee United at the time.

My dad wasn’t too sure, he didn’t want me to do it.“Other people advised me to do it and I had some great trips. I got one cap but I was in the squad seven or eight times.“Getting to train with people like Jonny Evans, Steven Davis…I loved the training and I loved the trips.“I would’ve liked to get more game time but it was causing a problem to my back and ultimately that’s why I stopped.”He made his Northern Ireland debut in a - hammering at the hands of the Netherlands on June , , just weeks after his Hibs side were beaten - by Hearts in the Scottish Cup Final.McPake – who came up against Dutch stars Arjen Robben, Wesley Sneijder and Robin van Persie – said: “It wasn’t like a normal friendly, it was mayhem.“The Amsterdam Arena was packed.

It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.“In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis.“This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.”Hello to all of the Dundee fans from all over the globe!  We hope this update finds everyone safe and well during these unprecedented and unimaginable times.  This, I have to say, is the strangest and scariest period, certainly of my letime and it has brought to the forefront, that, despite all of our dferences , we are truly all in this together and as such, we will get through this together.We at Dundee Football Club have been constantly monitoring the situation we find ourselves in due to the COVID- virus and have been taking advice, giving guidance, and implementing protocols to keep our staff, patrons and partners safe and sound as we ensure the sustainability of the club.First of all, the club do indeed have Business Interruption Insurance with specic additions of Notiable Diseases and Prevention of Access to our Commercial Combined Insurance Policy which should allow us to have options to reimburse those losses incurred due to the cancellation of matches. It would be our intention,the season is brought to an early conclusion, where practical, to reimburse those season ticket holders for the remainder of the season that was not played.  This will be further assessed for timelines, etc., as we make our way through the claims process. We have often said that the club is a family and that remains true throughout this situation.In addition to our insurance coverage, we have also sought to access ious sources of support offered by the League, the Association, Government agencies and our associates.  All that have been involved have been extremely helpful in our solidication of the club as a business.  I would like to personally thank John Bennett for his very generous and selfless gesture of suspending rent on the stadium. His call, on day one of this crisis helped to set the tone for all that followed throughout this shutdown and is the epitome of showing how we are all in this together.The UK Government and its agencies have also been extremely helpful in the offering of grants loans and providing relief through the Job Retention Scheme.  That includes HMRC. It is our experience, thus far, that this country’s handling of the crisis exceeds others in the mitigation of losses for businesses as well as iniduals.  In the coming days we will be implementing elements of the job retention scheme in respect of our staff and it is our intention that all are looked after fully throughout this crisis. This includes our football players, football staff and administrative staff receiving full pay while they are on furlough for the foreseeable future.We also think it is right to give credit to the dedicated workers at the SPFL and SFA. They have been working in an ever-changing landscape throughout this unprecedented event. They have continued to keep us informed and provide us advice on how to best navigate this predicament. They have freely shared the advice and guidance they are receiving from the government and UEFA as we all feel our way through these weeks. We continue to take advice and express our opinions on what football should look like when football resumes. Although none of us know yet what will transpire with this season, it is clear that football will be back.We’ve been inundated with requests on how people can help the club.  It’s truly been heart-warming. The one way to helpyou can – and onlyyou can # is to purchase season tickets and merchandise online.  We still have limited availability of this year’s Third Strip, which may become a collector’s item as it may never be worn.This supports the club as well as SSAFA and The Black Watch Association charities.  We will soon be launching our - kit in the upcoming days and we know it’s not enough to completely fill your appetite for football, but keep an eye on the social media sites for Dundee FC and DFC in the Community, which will provide some entertainment while we all do our part to save lives by staying home.We wish we had something more definitive to say, but we hope this brief update will provide some reassurance that we are still here and will remain here when this crisis is over.

Riverside was a shock for them on a December morning and certainly not what a guy like Caniggia was used to!“Caniggia, Ravanelli, Ketsbaia, all the top names that came into the club were brand new. They were great lads, they really were.“It was a bit surreal training against these boys. I was a bit stand-offish because I had a reputation of being a little rash and I wasn’t going to smash Caniggia in training!“He was just left to do his thing and you gave him the respect he deserves.“He basically got to do whatever he wanted around the club. Nobody was going to tell Caniggia he couldn’t do something!“We’d be at training and his five-year-old son would be up with us. We’d be doing a shooting exercise and running out of balls because Caniggia’s son had six at the side kicking them about!”Wilkie also revealed Caniggia’s free reign didn’t stop there and the Argentine was known to enjoy a pre-match cigarette in the Dens Park dressing room.He said: “We had the one cubicle in the changing-room and I used to like my pre-match toilet to just chill out and read the programme to get my mind ready for the game.“I’d always have to wait on Caniggia coming out the toilet because he’d be in there smoking a rolly-up.“He used to just come out with a wee smile on his face, shrug his shoulders and walk past you but that was just the kind of guy he was.“The Italians and the Argentines were horried the British boys would drink beer but they would smoke asit was the healthiest thing going.“They were really fit, though. Caniggia was probably the fittest guy I played with and fans could see that when he scored his first goal against Aberdeen and took his top off.“He was so strong for his age and looked after himself really well.“He was one of the biggest players in the world and it was amazing he was at Dundee.”It was a crucial time in Wilkie’s career but bust-ups with the Bonettis led to him going on loan to Plymouth Argyle, Notts County and Falkirk.But he found his way back to Dens, impressing then-Scotland manager Berti Vogts enough to get a call-up to the national team.“It was dficult for me because I was young and fiery and they were exactly the same,” Wilkie said of clashing with the Bonettis.“I had a couple of fall-outs with them that really came from nothing. It’s disappointing how it ended up because I really quite liked them.“Dario really knew his stuff as a coach and, as an ex-defender, he used to take us away to do bits and pieces in training.“I really enjoyed that. The two times I fell out with them were from silly little things in training that shouldn’t have happened.“My loan moves then came from the fall-outs but I got called back from Falkirk because they’d fallen out with Marco De Marchi and Fan Zhiyi.“When I was on loan at Notts County I’d pretty much given up. I was close to deciding I was done with football because I was fed up.“I was in a bad place. I got injured down there in my first or second game, sat stuck in a hotel and I thought that was me done.“I was only  so I was just a bit naive and immature I guess. Getting back to enjoying the game was about  per cent luck.“I was playing for Falkirk, doing OK and enjoying it in a young team in the First Division with boys like Mark Kerr and Lee Miller.“My head was still pretty much gone from the previous couple of months.

As we stood about on deck while the dishes were being washed a boy from one of the motor boats passed in his dinghy. He was wearing blue shorts and red stockings which brought from the Pilot the remark: #In Brodickyou don’t wear red stockings you might just as well be in Lamlash.#All but the Skipper and Mate went ashore on Centre Island for a stroll. The Major was still completely paralysed in his hind quarters but he was full of spirit and when the Bosun held up his hind legshe galloped along. It was a quiet peaceful evening with a very light northerly breeze but it was distinctly chilly and there was a magnicentsomewhat lurid sunset. The shore party back aboard the Bosun took the Tar off in the dinghy and they landed on Eilean na Beithe and while the former explored the island the latter played on a shingly shore – it was long after dark when they ed.At half past ten we began to turn in and, as always on the first evening, this was a longer business then usual as pillows and blankets had to be allocated and pillowslips put on but by a quarter past eleven we were all in bed and shortly after that a light shower pattered on the deck. The problem of what to do with the Doctor’s mattress was solved by the Pilot double banking his bunk. We were all very glad to have had such a good day for the start.It was noticed that voices were still coming from the ladies’ cabin when the last of us in the main cabin fell asleep.The Tanky brought an innovation to the Fulmar # #Quickies# # a patent washing gadget that saved precious water.We had a dead quiet night with, as far as any of us knew, no rain but the forecast was not good, promising north to north-east winds, force  to  with frequent heavy showers. The glass had continued its steady drop. When we turned out, a light but cold north wind was blowing from a well broken up sky.We had a breakfast of bacon and eggs then the Bosun took the Major ashore for his walk. The latter was possibly a little better and was able to take a few steps on the deck, but ashore on the rough ground could do nothing. While they were ashore the big motor boat with the red-stockinged boy left after very nearly going ashore on Seil Island while getting his anchor aboard.At twenty past ten we were away under engine, but as soon as we were outside the sails went up to the north-easterly breeze and we set off for the Sound of Mull. There was no sign of the swell that is usually met south of Kerrera and we got along quite well, but we could not point any higher than a mile or so south of Loch Don. The Pilot went below and brewed a welcome cup of tea which warmed us up, then we took a tack right up to the south coast of Kerrera and had a close up view of Gylen Castle and the Skipper waxed historical.Putting about again we passed close south of the Potlid Island, but when we were about halfway across to Loch Don the wind died and the strong ebb began to force us south and about the same time the rain came on.The engine was started and we headed up for Duart, but our progress was pitully slow, and indeed at one period we but barely held our ground. The Lady Rock and Lismore Lighthouse seemed never to get any nearer closing. When the engine had run an hour we waited for the first sign of the old familiar falter but none came and we began to hope a cure for its stopping had been effected by replacing the HT coil.This change was a despairing effort made because it was the only thing we had not tried, though all the pundits declare it could not possibly be the cause. The engine would either go or not go, they said, and it would never startthe coil was defective. We got one scare when it staggered for a moment, but the Bosun, who was at the tiller at the time, said we had just passed though a big mass of floating seaweed and may have got some round our propeller.As we were to prove later the cure had been found and the engine ran impeccably all the cruise and the Skipper had a lot of unkind thoughts about all the many professional motor experts who had caused him a great deal of trouble, not a little acute anxiety and more than considerable expense through their failure to diagnose a not very obscure disease.As we came up to the Black Memorial Tower Leonora crossed our bows making for Oban and another yachtpassed close by south bound under engine though by this time quite a reasonable and, for then, favourable breeze was blowing from the north-east and our sails were drawing.We learnt later that the owner’s we would not allow a sail to be set under any conditions as long as she was aboard – a pity, we thought, as she certainly was a lovely job and we felt it would have been betterthe we had decided to stay ashore.At Duart we stopped the engine and were able to make good progress, but the rain got heavier and heavier and our sandwich lunch was taken below in relays. Then at about three with the turn of the tide the wind died completely and the engine was started again. Near the Grey Rocks we saw St Roma coming south under power so we altered course to intercept her then at slow speed turned back the way we had come for a few hundred yards while we exchanged news.We heard a thoroughly bad forecast at mid-day, the wind had gone, the rain was stotting in the glassy sea, and, though the glass had come back only a fraction, we decided to call it a day so, with the Bosun the only dissentient, made for Loch Aline. As we turned inshore at Ardtornish we saw Seewolf to the north of us, becalmed but heading south, and guessed she would be joining us later. Coming in, when between Morven Pier and the Ferry Pier, the Skipper held too close to the west shore and the bottom showed up suddenly far too clearly for our peace of mind and a quick sheer out was necessary.Through the narrows we turned to starboard and anchored at half past four in Kyle Bay in a flat calm and the rain coming down heavier than ever. Gratefully we realised that it was not quite as bitterly cold as it had been out in the Sound.Seewolf came in shortly after going very slowly and Hamish Lawrence called over that he had run a big end and was on his way to Oban for repairs and to hand over to brother Alec and his family. Soon after that we were joined by a small motor boat, Saguenay, flying a blue ensign which, in view of her size, the Skipper was sure she was not entitled to do and then a little later, while we were warming up with some coffee, Lindisfarne arrived and anchored close beside us with Guy Clephane in his usual tremendousform – he’s a proper marvel is Guy.Hamish Lawrence came across in his dinghy and came aboard for a gin and while he was there Guy called over inviting Tanky and the Pilot across to Lindisfarne then sent the Pilot back to Fulmar to fetch the Bosun. Hamish gone, the Skipper began to put nine inch tacklines into our line of flags as we had discovered at Rothesay at the Royal Clyde Centenary Regatta that without them our line was about fteen feet too short and we wanted them to be right for the Queen’s visit to Tobermory.When the Pilot came back he and the Bosun got the tents up as the rain was by then torrential.We had a supper of sausages and beans and while the dishes were being done the Bosun took the Major ashore. He was walking a little bettervery slowly, but there was, unfortunately, no concrete results from his exercise.At nine o’clock we went in two loads across to Seewolf and were offered drinks OR tea, but the Skipper insisted on both. We were, however, not allowed any biscuits with our tea as to have them would have meant opening a new box and broaching Alec Lawrence’s stores. The Tanky had not wanted anything but tea, but Hamish had given her a good strong gin which she tried to hide on a shelf behind her and it was only got rid of when the Pilot took it off her hands and quickly put it to its proper use. The Bosun was drinking beer and when he opened up the tin a goodly portion of it bubbled onto the fitted carpet in the cabin.On board Seewolf were, besides the two paid hands, Hamish’s mother and his two sisters. The old lady, well over eighty, was in grand form and waxed eloquent on #The old days# and the greatness of #Belshaft#. Also on board was a great big collie who was obviously petted and spoilt beyond measure and he behaved more like a lap dog than the great big clumsy creature he was.It was half past eleven before we went back to Fulmar all in one load with little enough freeboard for the dinghy considering the conditions. There was a nasty little lop on the water, the northerly wind was bitterly cold, and the rain was as heavy as ever. As quickly as possible we got below and into our warm bunks, not even the Bosun wasting any time about it, though he did read for some time after all the rest were sound asleep."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 10 nessie and the lost golf balls","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham, Martin Laing and Keith McIntyre.

As part of this project the fund provided MACPool with seven aqua cycles and training from Hydrorider.Arriving early to take photogaphs of the others giving these bikes a go, any sense of nervousness was set aside as I watched healthcare professionals and fitness and well-being enthusiasts laugh and chat through their shot.After some quick adjustments to the bikes June, from our advertising department, and I were raring to go.Partially submerged, the feeling of being weightless combined with the resistance of the water as we began peddling was initially a bit odd. As we got used to the feeling, we started to speed things up, pretending we were racing the rest of our group to The Cairnbaan for a gin and tonic.Finding our rhythm, instructor Kathryn Craig began to lead us through arm exercises. Our co-ordination was put to the test as we carried on cycling while doing simple arm movements that felt more impactive due to the water resistance. Then for the real challenge # floating off the back of the bike while continuing to pedal – not an easy taskyou are short-legged but a workout that feels like it is doing you the power of good.For me aqua cycling is everything I hoped it would be – a fun, impactiveand enjoyable way of exercising. And I could still walk after it!With no aches and pains the next day and still smiling, I signed up for some of the classes.Classes y in intensity and are currently running on Tuesdays from .-.pm, Wednesday evenings from .-.pm and Saturdays from  .-.am.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"the voyages of the fulmar part 10","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhat a night!

The Pilot had a very justiable grouse about this as he had suggested lashing the tiller, but the Skipper had said that he did not think it necessary and that we would lie easierit was allowed to go free.About six we heard Murdoch in Venture hailing us and the Skipper and Pilot hurried on deck. The yachts in the harbour were all lying higgledy-piggledy owing to the swell, to there being little or not wind, to the strong surface current from the swollen river, and to it being about the turn of the tide.Venture and Fulmar were lying stern to stern and what had aroused Murdoch was that the Venture had got her mizzen boom over our main boom and as we pitched we had lted it up crutch and all – how nothing was broken was a miracle. She had then swung round and her now free boom had knocked the cap off our jackstay. As the Skipper came on deck Venture again surged towards us and started pitching and her counter came down with a terric slam not six inches from our bulwarks. We put our helm over and swung clear.Murdoch and Barclay were both in their dog-house and the Pilot and Skipper stayed in ours until the new tide took charge and the boats began to swing in normal fashion and all were able to retire once more to their bunks. Luckily the rain had cleared off shortly before this episode took place.At a quarter to eight we heard the usual poor forecast but for the first time since the cruise began there was not a gale warning for any area. The glass had risen well during the night. What wind there was was from the north-west.The Skipper went ashore for the milk and rolls. The dinghy had a lot of water in it and owing to the rolling it was impossible to get into it and balance on the thwarts till it was baled so the Skipper got his feet thoroughly soaked – the simple remedy of wearing seaboots had never occurred to him. Again the rolls were sold out and again he had to take porter biscuits.On board the Pilot lit the fire then started in to get our breakfast of bacon and egg. After our meal the sky cleared and it became a beautul sunny day, and everything we had was up on deck drying off or airing. The owner of Rose came alongside and for a good time tried to get us to persuade him to go north against his better judgement, but when we heard he had the lady member of his crew of three sick in her bunk our advice was that he go south and that immediately and reluctantly he was forced to agree and half an hour later he sailed. Hervor also went out about the same time and she turned north and we were to meet her later in Iona."},{"url":null,"title":"worldwide ceilidh community sign up for tunes in the hoose","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsCapercaillie founder Martin MacLeod, originally from Oban, and his son, also Martin, have came up with an innovative way to connect musicians from all over the world and allow them to play together for the enjoyment of others.#Tunes in the Hoose# was inspired by Scottish musician, and family friend of the MacLeods, Peter Wood, who was posting videos of himself playing tunes in his home during self-isolation.Having saw the footage Martin senior, called his filmmaker son to askhe had the technology and know-how to put a video together of him playing along to Peter’s video.#I run my own production company based out of Glasgow, so it’s relatively straight forward work for me ,# said Martin Junior.#From that first successful attempt, our new idea was to create an online community for all Scottish musicians to help them connect and continue to play together during these uncertain times.#Housed in Facebook, Tunes in the Hoose amassed over  followers last week with ,+ views worldwide.

Almost nobody has been untouched by it, although for some it has been more cataclysmic than others. But we are in this together, and it will be together that we pull through it.One of the real heartbreaking consequences of the lockdown has been the separation of families. Many grandparents now cannot see their grandchildren, or even their own children. Family of people who are ill cannot visit their loved ones. Each story has its own set of circumstances and sadly more is to come before it gets better.While we do need light-heartedness at this time, itrsquos also really important to acknowledge peoplersquos struggles. It was with gut-wrenching despair I realised a number of weeks ago that the arrival of Covid- in Europe was going to seriously affect so many families, my own included.I have five children, but my middle child, who is now  years old, has for the last eight years shared time between Scotland and Sweden.She went to school here until she was seven, when she began to attend school in Sweden. It was then that I had to adjust to the painful reality of less time with her, although I was still able to maintain regular time with her in Scotland and of course keep in daily touch.Itrsquos been an emotional rollercoaster, in which I have stories of me sleeping at airports, travelling through Scandinavian landscape at ungodly hours, and along the way meeting people who have helped and made a real dference. But itrsquos been worth it as it meant our blended family remained connected and my daughter hasnrsquot felt ided between two families but rather a full part of both.We were due to travel to Sweden this Friday andlater, but of course the flights were cancelled a couple of weeks ago. Explaining this to my daughter, and then not being able to say when we would be together was heartbreaking. I felt so helpless, unable to comfort her. Wersquod all counted down the days and now it seems it may be weeks, even months, before any reunion will be possible.I know that there will be families in similar or worse situations. My heart goes out to them all. My initial response to my situation was to close down with despair. The idea of not being with my child, for whom I was the equal main carer until recently, feels unbearable. Some friends have said, with good intentions: ldquoAt least shersquos safe.Yes she is, and I give thanks for that. But any loving parent facing long-term enforced separation from their child will understand the grief that such separation creates. It seeps into your being and makes it dficult to get through the day without having really dark moments. I tried to hide my emotions, but my loving and understanding we knows me too well yet she too felt helpless.There are moments in our lives when we are just overwhelmed by the impossibility of a situation and we just want to curl up and close down. I recently reached that point.Then my daughter asked me while we were talking online: ldquoI wish we could get a magic flying carpet or something dad, or ask the faeries to make a portal. She understood this wasnrsquot possible, but it was the wake-up call I needed. It made me realise I needed to get out of the pit of despair and, for her sake as well as mine, use my creativity to make that magic carpet, and that portal, to help us stay closely connected during this awful time.And the magic ingredient is stories. My daughter has always loved stories, and we have made many up together some of them have even been printed on this page. Now these stories help keep us connected and ease the pain of separation for us both.And so, with the help of technology, and, crucially, a good relationship with her mother, stories have begun to create a vital space for my daughter to be with her Scottish family, even when separated. We can all be together, even my grown-up daughters, who I miss even though they are isolating close by.We storytell to each other, make stories up and even share them in short films. Wee sister Skye, who is six and misses her sister like crazy, holds the tablet which she uses to speak to her, so they can be together while I tell stories and share riddles. We draw and add to the stories together, make fun dramas in which we film ourselves on phones acting out stories like Cinderella, and I have learnt to put wee films together which we can then watch together.Sharing stories like this has given extra meaning to our online communication. It takes us away from just asking ldquohow was your day  or ldquowhat did you do today  questions that often just seem to emphasise our current disconnection. Later, after this crisis is over, the wee films, the artwork and written stories will be memorabilia of this time our evidence that we remained close, even when forced apart.I write about this because I know there are parents and children out there in similarly dficult situations to say you are not alone in this and letrsquos be kind to each other and share the ways we keep ourselves connected. I also know others will have discovered better solutions, as Irsquom no technical wizard.Children are resilient, often more than their grown-ups are, but we need to help them manage this time emotionally, and when we canrsquot give them a hug or be physically with them in hard times, an inheritance of stories they can access can be a real support.I have often been less than enthusiastic about social media in the past, but right now people are discovering in this crisis it has become a leline in many ways.If you, or someone you know, are in a similar situation, please do get in touch. Letrsquos share our experiences, and understand that while we may be isolating, we are not alone."},{"url":null,"title":"european-stone-stacking-championships-dunbar-postponed","story":"The European Stone Stacking Championships were due to take place between April  and , with a place at the World Rock Stacking Championships in Texas next year up for grabs.However, James Craig Page, creator and director of the festival, broke the news that the event, like dozens of others across the county, had to be postponed amid concerns surrounding coronavirus.Mr Page said: ldquoIt has been postponed but we are very hopeful that we will find another venue or be able to go ahead at a dferent time.ldquoHowever, for the time being we have to postpone.This year would have marked the fth year a stone stacking event had taken place in Dunbar event.Each year, it attracts thousands of people to the area, as well as competitors from throughout Europe.Mr Page spoke to the Courier upon ing from the World Rock Stacking Championships in the USA last month.Initially, he was keen to see the European event, which takes place at Eye Cave Beach, off Bayswell Road, take place.However, upon ing to British shores, he became aware of the state of the global issue.Speaking to the Courier, he said: ldquoWe were just waiting for word and advice but it became apparent when I got back how bad things were and that we needed to put it on hold.ldquoWe donrsquot want to be taking any risks with anybodyrsquos health and wellbeing.

At a crucial time in the survival of the language, graduates have helped create a Gaelic speaking workforce that now holds key posts across a wide range of sectors in Scotland.Sabhal Mograver Ostaig is one of the key partners in fulfilling the governmentrsquos objectives in the National Gaelic Plan, which aims to increase the number of people speaking the language and accelerate the growth of Gaelic.Many people are keen to learn more about the language because of its rich culture and the college provides a wide range of short courses in Gaelic language, song and traditional music. Ceilidhs, workshops, conversation circles and music sessions all create an encouraging atmosphere that bring together students from  countries across five continents.As a modern, innovative college, Sabhal Mograver Ostaig has excellent learning resources on campus including an exceptional library collection, residential student accommodation, broadcast and recording facilities and a Gaelic medium childcare facility on site. It also has a growing international reputation for academic research.The college was founded on the principle of being part of the local and wider community and its activities are greatly enhanced by co-operative links, being home to a number of signicant national creative and cultural projects such as Tobar an Dualchais, Ainmean Agraveite na h-Alba and Cagravenan Graphics Studio. It plays a leading role in the promotion of the Gaelic arts and culture and also offers an international exchange programme with universities in Canada and Ireland.The collegersquos graduates include Seumas Greumach , Chief Executive of An Comunn Gaidhealach, which runs the Royal National Mod, who studied the Cugraversa Comais in  and then ed for another year to study Cagravenan is Cultar na Gagraveidhlig. He went to Sabhal Mograver to improve his language skills and says he would not hold his present job had he not become a fluent speaker.ldquoI was fully immersed in the language at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, which is essential to become fluent in any language. he says. ldquoYou could hear Gaelic being spoken every day, in every situation and that helped me no end in improving my own Gaelic. I gained a great deal of confidence in terms of Gaelic grammar, spelling and writing, all of which has been invaluable in my working le.BBC weather presenter, Joy Dunlop, is another graduate of the college who says the fluency in Gaelic she developed at the college has given her many opportunities that she otherwise would not have had.She studied Gaelic as a second language when she was a pupil at Oban High School then decided to do her sixth year at the college. She initially planned to stay for just one year to do the Cugraversa Comais but loved it so much she stayed for four, graduating with a BAin Cagravenan agus Cultar na Gagraveidhlig .ldquoAttending Sabhal Mograver was a revelation for me, she says. ldquoThe education I received was unparalleled.ldquoThe personal support and guidance I received from all the staff was of the highest level and I always felt that our teachers were genuinely invested in both the language itself and our progress.ldquoBeing immersed in the language is definitely the best way to learn, dficult as it could be at times, and having the opportunity to speak Gaelic in both the classes and the community was a real help to me.ldquoSimply,you genuinely want to learn Gaelic, there is no better place to do so than Sabhal Mograver Ostaig.

"},{"url":null,"title":"Iain Macwhirter  The PM   s plight should show that we are all in this together","story":"In fact, Boris Johnson never said we should ldquotake it on the chin, as the independent Fact Check UK has pointed out repeatedly. It is one of the many canards which have debased social media in this crisis and turned Twitter into a pariah medium.What he told Philip Schofield on This Morning on March  was that ldquoone of the theories is that people should ldquotake it on the chin and not take measures to prevent the spread of the disease. He went on to say that this was not the Governmentrsquos policy, and that it was pursuing a ldquobalanced approach and taking measures to ldquoprotect the NHS.But that hasnrsquot stopped people saying it for him. It has become a political factoid, an article of faith that Mr Johnson, under the guidance of his dark amanuensis Dominic Cummings, has been pursuing a social Darwinist, survival-of-the-fittest approach to Covid-.Enough. Everyone with any decency should simply be wishing the Prime Minister and his pregnant partner, Carrie Symonds, well right now, following the lead of Nicola Sturgeon yesterday when she echoed the Get Well, Boris slogan.It could be any one of us in the next few weeks. This is a moment to reflect on the fragility of existence and the gt of being alive. For once, we really are all in this together.The only grain of truth in the ldquochin theory is that, as is widely known, Mr Johnson has tended to see illness as something other people get. He has famously robust good health and former advisers, like the journalist Guto Harri, say theyrsquove never seen him ill before.All the more reason to take this disease seriously. It doesnrsquot just kill the very old or those with medical issues. Even a fit, tennis-playing political leader in his prime has had to be placed in intensive care fighting for his le.This is not like a bad dose of flu, as President Trump unhelpfully suggested. Covid- mocks us because many carriers have mild symptoms or none at all. Then, after  days,the symptoms donrsquot go away it turns very nasty.There is so much we do not know about coronavirus. What we do know is that it is gendered ndash though not in the way we expect that word to be used. It seems to hit men very hard, and twice as many die of it. Women seem to have some form of genetic immunity.Either that or men just ldquodonrsquot look after themselves as some believe. That might actually be the case with Mr Johnson, since hersquos been under immense pressure over the past year: replacing Theresa May, renegotiating Brexit, then fighting a General Election.So, no one should be under any illusion that hersquoll be able tonormally any time soon. This raises dficult questions. Who in his Cabinet will have the authority to tell him that he canrsquot be allowed to take key decisions while his faculties are impaired Who exactly is in charge  The First Secretary, Dominic Raab, is formally chairing Cabinet committees. But that begs the question of who takes the final decisions. Where does the buck stop Someone has to balance the competing demands of the two front-line Cabinet ministers, Matt Hancock and Rishi Sunak. They have very dferent constituencies of interests. Mr Hancock is all about saving the NHS and avoiding immediate deaths Mr Sunak is about saving the economy, upon which just as many lives could ultimately depend.Who decides whether and for how long to renew the lockdown on Monday  It will almost certainly be continued, but should there be a provisional timetable for lting aspects of it, following Austria and Denmark Research led by Professor Russell Viner for University College London appears to show that keeping schools closed is of little use in halting the spread of coronavirus. Yet it damages the educational prospects of less-well-off children. Others disagree, including, it seems, Professor Neil Ferguson of the celebrated Imperial College report that prompted the lockdown last month.The minor scandal of the Scottish Chief Medical Officer, Dr Catherine Calderwood, breaking her own stay-at-home guidelines underlines the problem of compliance. For the comfortable middle classes, with gardens and nice homes, lockdown is tolerable but working-class families in small flats may find it unbearable.Then again, should the UK be encouraging the wearing of masks  Countries like Austria and Slovakia have made them compulsory. America is adopting masks on the grounds that it slows the spread of the disease. But the advice here is still that theyrsquore of little use.A broader question now there is a new Labour leader, is a government of national unity. Keir Starmer has clearly ordered his new shadow cabinet members to stop saying ldquowe were right and start talking constructively about how to revive a moribund economy when the lockdown is over.The Opposition has a crucial role to play in getting the Government to focus and be clear about what it is doing. But should there be a more formal arrangement, as in the Second World War when the then Labour leader Clement Attlee, was made Deputy Prime Minister It would mean the Opposition is bound by collective responsibility, and has to endorse the decisions made by Government in the next few weeks. On the other hand it would greatly enhance the political profile of the new Labour leader, and could provide a  on which Sir Keir could build a winning election campaign, in the way Attlee won the post-war General Election in .These are decisions that only a Prime Minister can make, for the simple reason that he will be required to accept the consequences. This is a desperate time for him and the country, as the death toll continues to rise.As I write, it seems that the PMrsquos condition is stable. Twitter aside, there has been a considerable degree of public sympathy for Mr Johnson. No one can be in any doubt that he feels our pain. The Prime Minister is, as it were, the first casualty among equals.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Shops across Scotland are closing.

The wording is apparently so ldquocack-handed ndash the charityrsquos phrase ndash that recipients are misinterpreting it to mean they will not receive any medical helpthey contract the virus.This is not what the letter says, but it would be an easy mistake to make. Evenit were clear, it would still be upsetting. Signing a DNAR is almost as sure an indication that the end of the line is fast approaching as requesting the last rites. Often it is signed by those with power of attorney for elderly relatives who are no longer of sound mind. Brutal though it looks when expressed in cold print, the intention behind it is compassionate.At a certain stage of ill-health, the process of resuscitation can be harsh. It unnecessarily prolongs suffering rather than allowing someone who has suffered a cardiac arrest to slip away peacefully. In some circumstances, especially where the patient is extremely frail, resuscitation is the worst of all options. Hard though it is to accept, the prospect of death can come as a relief to some for whom there is no hope of recovery, and who are simply longing to be gone.But for many who received this bald DNAR request, that is not the case. Instead of being asked to speed up and simply medical bureaucracy, they needed reassurance that, should they fall ill with Covid , they will be treated like anyone . The only grey area is over what they wish done in the event they require resuscitation. In their thoughtless and insensitive mail-shot, doctors presumably have pre-selected those for whom they think a DNAR is in their best interests. But what a way to go about it. It brings to mind Treasure Island and the sinister Black Spot pressed into piratesrsquo hands, signying their imminent demise.Even worse is the case of a care home where some residents, who were mentally well, learned staff had signed these forms on their behalf. I would not wish to be the manager should anyonersquos otherwise robust existence end prematurely because of a legally binding instruction they knew nothing about.What all this points to is troubling. There has been much trumpeting about the ways in which communities are pulling together under lockdown, growing stronger and kinder because of the strain on those who are least able to help themselves. Despite this, however, there is an insidious undercurrent to some discussions, a faint suggestion that the aged are in danger of being perceived as a nuisance, a drain on limited resources that are better used for the young. The tenor of recent government guidelines appears to hint that when people reach a certain vintage they should expect less heroic or interventionary treatment, and accept thatthings take a turn for the worst, their time is up.When new guidance was issued to medics by the former Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood last week, Dr Donald Macaskill, chief executive of Care Scotland, was perturbed at its implications: ldquoNothing in this document gives me confidence that we will not be putting our clinicians in a position where they have no option but to decide on the basis of age.Le-saving equipment and highly trained medical staff are undoubtedly in limited supply. When intensive care beds and ventilators have to be rationed, then the decision of who benefits most will have to be made. Who would envy a doctor faced with such a bleak choice But it would be a terrible indictment of our societythe exigencies of this emergency fostered the sense that old is synonymous with surplus. If the word ldquopensioner is in danger of becoming a le-threatening label the long-term legacy of this disease will be far worse than the number of fatalities. It will have buried one of the primary principles on which modern civilisation is based.The idea that iniduals automatically become obsolescent after a certain age is repugnant. So too that their worth diminishes with each year. Who has the authority or right to say that one personrsquos le is more valuable than another  The more I see of friends in their eighties and nineties, the more I understand the old joke: Who would want to live to   Someone who is .One of the reasons this pandemic is so intense is because we have long recognised the importance of seniors. Modern medical advances have been expressly designed to allow much of the population to reach and enjoy advanced age, eventhey do rattle occasionally with their daily regimen of pills.Before going to university I worked for a year as an auxiliary nurse in a small hospital, on the male and female geriatric wards. It was a revelatory experience. Some of the patients had dementia, a few were permanently bed-bound, but there was not one of them who could not find some enjoyment and pleasure each day, or who did not retain much of their personality. It was an inspirational lesson that one of the finest achievements of society is to take such loving care of those whose best years are behind them, and for whom the future is measured in months, weeks, or simply hours.It is not for the state to determine who lives and dies. Every day doctors quietly make these calls, for reasons of humanity, and we must trust their judgement. When they need to discuss matters of le and death with relatively healthy patients, however, they would do well to remember that up to the very end, we all will rage against the dying of the light, and rightly, properly so.Shops across Scotland are closing.

It can be harmful to lambs, calves and other animals and wildle too.But for farmers and other landowners, it is also costly to clean up.ldquoDealing with litter and flytipping costs an eye watering pound million of public money in Scotland every year, and thatrsquos only in relation to public land.ldquoThis money could be better spent where, particularly at this time.ldquoWhen litter and flytipping occurs on private land such as farmersrsquo fields, it is down to the owner to have it removed ndash and to foot the bill for doing so. The costs involved are huge.ldquoThe effects are not all financial either. Flytipping takes time to clear responsibly, can block access, and can cause issues around health and safety.ldquoThe public can also help by acting as the eyes and ears of their community - we urge anyone who notices flytipping to report it, so it can be dealt with by the appropriate authority.ldquoThis can be done in a number of ways, including through the online Dumb Dumpers website or reporting directly to the relevant local authority.ldquoAs rural and environmental organisations, we are working together to stop flytipping ndash but we can only do it with the publicrsquos support.The joint statement was signed by Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of Scottish Land and Estates NFUS president Andrew McCornick Alan Dron, rural crime coordinator at the Scottish Partnership Against Rural Crime Barry Fisher, chief executive of Keep Scotland Beautul and Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland.The plea comes amid reports of a surge in flytipping across the UK.Residents have been urged to act responsibly as councils suspend normal services such as household waste centres to cope with the Covid- pandemic.There have also been concerns over an increase in waste as families spend more time at home and stock up on supplies.Councils across Scotland have scaled-back services.The collection of bulky waste has been suspended at Glasgow City Council since March .It urges residents not to leave items on the street. Its website adds: ldquoPlease leave any unwanted items safely on your own property such as your back garden or your back court and remain mindful of any fire risk.All household waste recycling centres are closed until further notice.Edinburgh has also suspended the collection of bulky waste, and advises residents: ldquoIf you have large items please keep them at home and only use communal and wheelie bins for your day to day waste and recycling.The cityrsquos recycling centres are also closed until further notice.Mavis Valley Recycling Centre in East Dunbartonshire has been closed since March , while household waste recycling centres in West Lothian were shut on the same date.In West Dunbartonshire, the recycling centres at Ferry Road and Dalmoak are closed until further notice.Similar measures have been put in place at councils up and down the country.Mark Ruskell MSP, the Scottish Greensrsquo farming spokesman, said flytippers are putting others at risk.He said: ldquoFlytipping is illegal and dangerous at any time, but at a time of national emergency it is a downright disgrace. Emergency regulations state that people must stay at home unless they have an essential reason to be out.ldquoThose perpetrating this anti-social practice are not only breaching these regulations but they are putting others at risk, potentially spreading the virus while doing so.ldquoIrsquod urge anyone with information on anyone engaging in this irresponsible activity to report it to police and local authorities immediately.Scottish Conservative rural affairs spokeswoman Rachael Hamilton MSP said: ldquoThe country is going through an unprecedented crisis and farmers are doing their best to keep the food and drink supplies coming.ldquoThe very least they deserve is to be repaid by increased fly-tipping.ldquoFlytipping is dangerous to livestock and hazardous for farm workers to clear-up.

I donrsquot want to be doing it, but it is vital for the health reasons I think we all understand.On Wednesday, Ms Sturgeon warned it would be a \"monumental mistake\" to ease the coronavirus lockdown measures too early and said parents should not expect schools to reopen any time soon.Ms Sturgeon also predicted Scotland would be left dealing with a \"mental health legacy\" of coronavirus once the disease once under control.She said the effects of isolation would be felt long after the pandemic had peaked.Responding to a question from Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie about possible counselling services for NHS staff and other mental health work, she said: \"Not just in the immediate phase of dealing with this, but I suspect for a long time afterwards, were going to be dealing with a mental health legacy of it.\"We have to make sure that the services that provide the help that people need are there and that means expanding access to counselling now, but looking ahead to make sure that these services are appropriate in the future as well.\"She said more funding was going to expand services online, including the Breathing Space service, and that the mental health of people across Scotland, particularly those in the health and social care sector, was \"very high on the priority list of the Scottish Government\".Before Boris Johnson became infected with the disease, he committed to review the measures after three weeks, which will be reached on Monday, but Downing Street has said it will now take place \"on or around\" that point.Emergency legislation designed to assist with Covid-s containment must also be reviewed at least once every  days - with the first due to be carried out by April  at the latest."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-calls-scottish-government-support-newspaper-industry-amid-pandemic","story":"The Tories said the vital role played by Scotlands trusted regional press was clearer than ever amid the coronavirus crisis.The partys finance spokesperson Donald Cameron has urged Finance Secretary Kate Forbes to work with the UK Government to ensure action is taken as quickly as possible.The Conservatives are calling for a % rates holiday and called on the Scottish Government to spend more on advertising its public health messages in newspapers rather than online s.:Coronavirus in Scotland: Nicola Sturgeon says lockdown to last several more weeksMr Cameron has also suggested investing in a similar scheme to the Danish government, which has introduced a fund for media organisations during the crisis - at an estimated cost to the Scottish Government of around pound million.

Its other uses in a similar vein include the likes of ldquothe good book for the Bible or ldquogood tide at Christmas.Was Christ crucied on a Friday The day of the week was not mentioned in the Bible and there has been speculation it may have taken place earlier in the week, due to a Gospel reading from Matthew which says Christ would be dead for ldquothree days and three nights. As it is believed the resurrection took place on a Sunday, then this might mean the crucixion took place on a Wednesday or Thursday.It was not always observed The question of whether and when to mark the crucixion was a controversial issue in early Christianity and until the fourth century, the Last Supper, death and resurrection were observed in one commemoration the evening before Easter. From then on, they were marked separately.How is it marked Many denominations, including the Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran and Anglican churches, observe Good Friday with fasting and church services, while countries around the world have their own traditions, ranging from flying kites to reenactments.Kites In Bermuda, residents make and fly their own kites to symbolise the ascension of Christ to heaven, before indulging in a feast of cod fishcakes and hot cross buns. Good Friday parties are usually held, with kites flying over picnics islandwide and even \"repair areas\" set up in parks, with tissue paper, glue and tape to patch up any kite damage.Re-enactments They take place around the world, including in the Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa, where , actors re-enact Christrsquos walk to his death. One man then plays the role of Jesus and wearing a crown of thorns, he is flogged in the streets while carrying a -pound cross.Jerusalem Carrying wooden crosses and singing hymns, thousands of Christians take part in a procession through the Old City of Jerusalem, retracing the steps Christ is believed to have taken carrying his cross to his crucixion.And in the Philippines In Pampanga, between three and  men are physically nailed to a cross each Good Friday to recreate the crucixion.Why does the date change The date for Good Friday dfers annually as Easter is determined by the moon - it falls on the first Sunday following the paschal full moon, which is the first full moon after the spring equinox, thought to have been determined by clerics in the middle ages.This year The  observance will be vastly dferent, of course, with places of worship closed and most of us restricted to our own homes amid lockdown.MAUREEN SUGDEN"},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-pot-luck","story":"A FRIEND of Milngacie reader Robin Gilmour owns an antiques shop in Newport Pagnell.

Using a scientic technique called genotype imputation, the researchers have developed a lower-cost method that could make the process feasible for more breeders and producers.The approach uses a smaller number of genetic marers to predict the resistance of salmon to sea lice. This looks for iations at specic positions in the genes of fish that indicate how it will respond to parasites and disease.The information then allows breeders to select parent fish with improved resistance to sea lice.Similar techniques have been used successfully in livestock breeding programmes and could be effective in other aquaculture species, including shrimp and tilapia.The process could also be used as a preventative measure to improve other important health traits, suchas resistance to gill disease.Meanwhile, gill disorders can be caused by the growth of micro-organisms in the water such as plankton and algae.The researchers worked in collaboration with Hendrix Genetics and the University of Stirling s Institute of Aquaculture as part of a project supported by the Scottish Aquaculture Innovation Centre .Professor Ross Houston, chairmanof aquaculture genetics at the Roslin Institute, said: \"Sea lice is one of the costliest health-related problems forthe global salmon industry and can have a wide-scale impact on salmon health and welfare. In this study we used low density genetic markers to predict the resistance of salmon to sea lice. This is potentially a more cost-efficient way of breeding salmon with improved resistance to parasites and other diseases, helping to improve animal welfare and production.\"Scotland has more than  salmon farms, which produce , tons of fish a year. Concerns about the scale of sea lice problems recently prompted the introduction of new rules that require the farmed salmon industry to report weekly levels of sea lice.The Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation, however, has maintained farm operators have made progress in the fight against sea lice, with levels recently said to be at their lowest in six years.The industry has introduced a range of counter meamsures aimed at preventing and controlling lice infestations, including hydrolicers and thermolicers, which use water rather than chemicals in medicines to clear affected fish.Net pens with skirts, semi-closed containment systems that prevent lice copepodites from finding salmon and ldquocleaner fish that eat the lice from infected salmon have also been used, while some researchers are working on lice vaccines.Caroline Grfin, aquaculture innovation manager at SAIC, said: ldquoCollaborative research projects are crucial for finding new methods for enhancing fish health and wellbeing, while also supporting the future sustainability of the industry.ldquoSea lice continues to be a prominent challenge for the sector worldwide and developing cost-effective, data-led techniques for future breeding could transform the ways in which we manage and treat sea lice on fish farms."},{"url":null,"title":"uzma-mir-playing-happy-families-lockdown-no-neither","story":"By a weird quirk of fate, lockdown sees me living with my recently-ed-from-London younger brother.

Where do you feel the anxiety  Be conscious of what your body is telling you. Is your heart racing, stomach churning  To help ease these symptoms, be mindful of your breathing. Inhale through your nose for  slowly and exhale through your mouth again counting to  slowly. Repeat this exercise four times.AwarenessWe cannot control how her lersquos have changed due to this pandemic but what we can control is our thoughts to this global crisis. To quote from the Greek philosopher Epictetus ldquoPeople are not disturbed not by things, but by the views they take of them. Through awareness of how our thoughts make us feel, we can challenge these to more positive helpful thoughts. Awareness is the key to unlocking our distorted thoughts and through recognising whether we are for example predicting, judging or catastrophising, this can assist us in challenging and changing these negative obtrusive thoughts to more positive helpful ones.Self-CareTake this time as an opportunity to look after self. Self-care is crucial for building up resilience to le events and there is no time more important than in the now to engage in self-care: it is a priority. Self-care consists of several elements:Physical self-care such as nutrition, exercise and sleep.Mental self-care such as being aware of our thoughts and behaviours and engaging in activities such as crosswords. Emotional Self-care such as being aware of our emotions for example anger and sadness and how these can be managed. For example, through keeping a daily journal to recognise the triggers for our emotions.Spiritual Self-care such as awareness of when our minds are racing with thoughts and to try and be still. Engage in activities such as meditation, mindfulness and through being still in the now this will quieten the racing mind and provide strength at this challenging time. Take time to assess your self-care by implementing a self-care plan and commence small steps to change through looking after self. ldquoAn empty lantern provides no light. Self-care is the fuel that allows your light to shine brightly. If you find yourself struggling with anxiety, low mood or lapsing into unhelpful ways of coping, then contact Sharon.

Situated on the banks of the River Teviot, in an award-winning conversion of the former Victorian electrical works, the distillery is laying down spirit for a future Single Malt release, makes an excellent gin, and recently released a vodka.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin is genuinely Scottish Gin ndash wholly distilled from barley grown within  miles of the distillery. It is named after William Kerr ndash Hawick-born, and among the th centuryrsquos most accomplished botanists. He sent  plant specimens back to Kew Gardens from his Far East travels.Kerr would likely have approved of the distilleryrsquos Carterhead Still ndash one of only a handful in operation. It gently heats the botanicals rather than boiling them like most other gin stills, capturing more of the subtle flavours. Together with the barley, this gives the gin a distinctive depth. The rounded flavour works well with the bitterness of tonic water, creating a beautully balanced GT.The newest addition to distilleryrsquos range is Puffing Billy Steam Vodka ndash unfiltered malted barley vodka, named after the special still which plays a key role in its production. The spirit is steamed through charcoal inside the still itself and never filtered as a liquid, preserving the delicious character of the barley.Itrsquos the only vodka in the world made this way, and drinks commentators have praised the result, suggesting it could reinvigorate vodka, a spirit somewhat overlooked during the recent gin boom. Fabulous with tonic or Ginger Beer, the vodka also tastes incredibly smooth sipped chilled and straight.Kerrrsquos Borders Gin and Puffing Billy Steam Vodka are available direct from the distilleryrsquos online shop, currently offering free delivery anywhere within the UK when you buy a bottle.See www.thebordersdistillery shop ------------------------------------------------The Mortgage Advice Service ScotlandRe-mortgaging During the Coronavirus OutbreakAlthough health concerns are their immediate priority, people are searching for ways to reduce their monthly expenditure and cutting their biggest monthly outlay makes financial sense.Although the Coronavirusis having a signicant impact on obtaining funds for purchasing a new home, re-mortgages are still available from lenders at competitive rates and depending on the size of your mortgage, you could make substantial savings each month by simply changing lenders.Re-mortgaging neednt be a hassleEvenyou can save hundreds of pounds by shopping around, the thought of trying to switch your current mortgage may seem like a hassle you could do without.However, re-mortgaging isnt nearly as much hassle as you may think, because, thats where we step in and do all the work that is involved in finding you a fresh deal that can lower your monthly payments and maybe even help you to pay off your mortgage quicker.Choosing the right mortgage can be tricky.Next to purchasing your home, choosing the right mortgage is probably one of the most important decisions you will make when you are looking for a new deal.Approaching your current lender or bank may not result in you obtaining the best mortgage deal because they generally only consider their own products.

Today’s [April ] change means new parents won’t miss out financially and can keep their families safe.“The Government will do whatever it takes to support people and the NHS during this outbreak, and HMRC are working around the clock to help families and businesses across the UK.”Angela MacDonald, Director General for Customer Services, HMRC said: “It’s really important that new parents remember to register for Child Benefit, even during these unprecedented times.“The increase in Child Benefit is a boost for family budgets but there’s more to claiming than the payments.

Parents will need their National Insurance number or Child Benefit number.Child Benefit claims can be backdated by up to three months and are paid into bank accounts, usually every four weeks.Only one person can claim Child Benefit for a child. For couples with one partner not working or paying National Insurance contributions, making the claim in their name will help protect their State Pension.HMRC is also reminding High Income Child Benefit Charge customers of the importance of claiming these benefits, eventhey choose to opt out of receiving monetary benefits.The tax charge applies to anyone with an income over £,, who claims Child Benefit or whose partner claims it. Eveniniduals do have to pay the tax charge, they could still be better off by claiming Child Benefit # the tax is % of Child Benefit for each £ of income over £,.Parents can use the Child Benefit tax calculator to work out how much they may have to pay, or they can opt out of receiving Child Benefit payments altogether when they complete the form, so they won#t have to pay the charge but will still protect their State Pension.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The shot was clearly going just wide of the upright before Fraser MacDonald inadvertently erted it into his own net for a bizarre opener.”Under the canny guidance of manager Angie Murchison, Skye’s useful blend of youth and experience continued to revel on the big stage. Youngsters like Somhairle Macdonald, Ewen MacSween, John MacLean and Allan MacLeod had established themselves along with several survivors of the  team – Cowie, Willie MacRae, Peter Gordon, John ‘Bodach’ Mackenzie, Ally MacDonald and Ewen MacKinnon.With  minutes played the islanders doubled their advantage.McCormack takes up the action: “John MacLean delivered a corner into the danger area, and with keeper Kenny MacDonald under pressure Cowie took two attempts before slipping the ball over the line as he tumbled face-forward onto the pitch”.Skye’s fans were in dreamland but, as the reporter had noted: “Kyles are famous for their battling qualities”.By half time the match was level.From a powerful hit in from the right the ball broke to veteran Dan MacRae “who had time and space to place the shot beyond the reach of keeper MacKenzie.”Then, calamity struck Skye in the closing moments of the half.“Another massive hit in by Tom White caused panic in the Skye defence, and as MacKenzie lashed out in an attempted clearance the ball appeared to come back past him off team captain MacSween”.Seconds later it took an outstanding save from MacKenzie to deny Dallas Turner and prevent Kyles from turning around in the lead.Murchison’s men regrouped.“The second half had been underway less than  seconds before Skye retook the initiative thanks to a corner which was turned in by Cowie, with Peter Gordon hovering to pick up on any mistake.”For much of the second half Kyles were kept well away from the Skye danger area, but a fourth goal proved elusive – thanks in large part to legendary goalkeeper Kenny MacDonald.And with Skye just eight minutes away from sealing a place in the final the men in blue hauled themselves back from the brink.Our reporter said that Dallas Turner “had looked the likeliest threat” and it was the youngster who “saw a glimmer of an opening and fired in a shot which took a deflection and flew past Bodach MacKenzie and into the net”.“That was the signal for the islanders to lay siege to the Kyles goal and for the Tighnabruaich keeper to dig dep with a string of exceptional saves.”MacLean, Somhairle MacDonald , Gordon and Cowie were all denied before the whistle sounded to herald extra time.In “energy-sapping heat” it was hardly surprising that the added half hour was more low-key, but five minutes into the second period came a “glorious chance” for Skye.Referee Donne Fraser spotted an infringement in the area, and the islanders were awarded a penalty.Rankin stepped up, but was unable to make clean contact and the “scuffed spot hit was easily turned away by MacDonald”.And so to a penalty shoot-out. Both goalkeepers excelled themselves, MacDonald saving two, and MacKenzie doing likewise. With Kyles - ahead, Rankin had to score to force sudden death, but his shot sailed wide and it was Kyles who went through to the final.Ian McCormack concluded: “Rankin was hero as well as villain. Once he got the measure of Ronnie MacVicar he dictated play from the centre, giving a hundred per cent in effort and running himself into the ground in the process. Up front Willie Cowie was immense – especially for a player just back from injury.“And while the defence as a whole were tight, Willie MacRae at buckshee back gave another award-winning performance.“If there was a man of the match award it would undoubtedly have gone to Kyles keeper Kenny MacDonald, who had excellent cover from full back Fraser MacDonald.“Their most dangerous forward was Dallas Turner, while that veteran Dan MacRae showed he still has a few seasons left in him at the top level.”In the final Kingussie, in the middle of a run of seven-successive Camanachd Cup triumphs, proved too strong, though Kyles gave a good account of themselves and had taken the lead before succumbing to a - defeat.The redoubtable Kenny MacDonald was the final’s man of the match, but his remarkable career had still some way to run.

I have always liked Easter and although I have less connection now with the institution of the Catholic Church, Good Friday always is a special day for me. It is the one afternoon that I try to slip into a church to reflect on the le of Jesus and his execution by crucixion all those years ago. This Good Friday the churches are closed. In fairness a church is not necessary for reflection. Any quiet place will do. But it will be strange nonetheless. vw, px\"  GERRY ADAMS:  commemorations will be more personalFor those of us who commemorate the  Easter Rising this will be a strange year also. There were Easters when repression and imprisonment, north and south, resulted in only a handful of activists coming together at gravesides and republican memorials to lay a wreath, read the Proclamation and list the names of our patriot dead. These were the Easters when successive Irish and Unionist governments banned such remembrances and used brutal tactics to enforce that ban. During the more recent years of conflict some Easter commemorations and republican memorials and graves were also bombed and damaged.This Easter we face a dferent kind of adversary. A silent, deadly enemy – the Coronavirus. So the traditional Easter commemorations have been cancelled.But that doesn’t mean that republicans will not commemorate our patriot dead. On the contrary this year commemorations will be more personal, more intimate, as we as iniduals and as families participate in our own little commemorative events or join in the online programme devised by Sinn Féin and others during this unprecedented health emergency. This includes a programme of social media events and posts, videos # some historical, speeches, including the keynote Easter address by Party President Mary Lou McDonald TD, music, encouraging children to produce art work reflecting on Easter, poetry, the flying of our national flag and the wearing of the Easter Lily.Many of us have favourite rebel songs and poems of struggle about the many dferent periods of rebellion in Ireland from , through Robert Emmet, the Young Irelanders, the Fenians, to Easter  and the Tan and Civil Wars, to the more recent decades of conflict. So as more and more people put video messages on social media why not consider posting your favourite rebel song  Or sing it yourself  But onlyyou’ve the voice for it. That leaves you out RG. Brón orm, chara.Or pick a poem by Pearse or Connolly or Bobby Sands or the last words of republican heroes. If you are a relative or friend or admirer of one of our patriot dead consider putting up a photo and telling their story.Court MartialThe book ‘Last Words’ by Piaras F. MacLochlainn is a personal favourite. It contains the letters and statements of the leaders who were executed after the  Rising. The poems of Pearse and the defiant statement by James Connolly to his court martial are often quoted but I have always had a special grá for Tom Clarke. He spent  years in English prisons in the s and s and endured long years of solitary confinement during which he was treated appallingly. In  he was the first signatory of the seven who signed the Proclamation. In the early hours of May  his we Kathleen, who was a prisoner in Dublin Castle, was brought to visit him in his cell under military escort. With a candle held by a British soldier for light and just hours before his execution Thomas Clarke gave Kathleen a message for the Irish people. It was brief but poignant.“I and my fellow-signatories believe we have struck the first successful blow for freedom. The next blow, which we have no doubt Ireland will strike, will win through. In this belief we die happy.” vw, px\"  National Graves Easter Parade JCThe story of the love of Joseph Plunkett and Grace Gford is well known. ‘Last Words’ contains a letter from Plunkett to Grace on  May in which he writes: “Listen –I live it might be possible to get the Church to marry us by proxy – there is such a thing but it is very dficult I am told. Father Sherwin might be able to do it. You know how I love you. That is all I have time to say. I know you love me and so I am very happy.”At pm on the evening of May  Grace was brought to the prison chapel. Joseph entered accompanied by a party of soldiers with fixed bayonets. The soldiers remained while Fr Eugene McCarthy read the marriage service by the light of a candle. After the ceremony they had to separate. A few hours later in the early hours of May  Grace was brought back to the prison and met her husband in his cell. They had ten minutes. Plunkett was executed on the morning of May  along with Edward Daly, Willie Pearse, and Michael O’Hanrahan.Oh Grace just hold me in your arms and let this moment lingerThey#ll take me out at dawn and I will dieWith all my love I place this wedding ring upon your fingerThere won#t be time to share our love for we must say goodbye.A century ago this November Kevin Barry was executed in Mountjoy Prison in Dublin. The song, which commemorates this young  year old, is a firm favourite with many. It has never lost its ability to stir the heart and remind us of the courage of this young man and his comrades. It has been recorded and sung countless times over the years, including by Paul Robeson and Leonard Cohen. Robeson’s version can be found online.A Nation Once AgainIn an earlier generation the essays and poems of Thomas Davis reminded people of the  Rising and of the awful impact of British colonialism on Ireland. RG has an edition of a book – Essays and Poems: Thomas Davis – published by the Gresham Publishing Company some time around the s. Davis died at the age of  from scarlet fever in  the first year of An Gorta Mór. One of his enduring works is ‘A Nation Once Again’.And then I prayed I yet might seeOur fetters rent in twain,And Ireland, long a province beA Nation Once Again.Davis also wrote ‘The West’s Asleep’ which in more recent years has been made famous by the Dublinersand the Clancy Brothers and others as ‘The West’s Awake’.So, this week and next use social media to post a personal reflection of the events in Dublin and where in  and of all those periods of struggle in Ireland’s long history of resistance and our demand for freedom. It can be something from YouTube or it can be you and those in your home or you and your friends singing, reciting, reading about Ireland’s patriot dead.These are some of my personal words and poems and lyrics.

But local representatives told the Belfastthe money will only be usedabsolutely necessary.DUP Westminster leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the rise to expenses, which applies to all eight party members, was indicative of the exceptional circumstances.Parliamentary authorities have made provision for MPs to avail of additional office costs to be incurred so that staff may continue to safely continue their work, he said.It allows for the purchase of any additional IT equipment for staff to work from home or for telephone systems to be amended so that important queries from constituents can still be dealt with.The support is not given directly to MPs, but enables them to purchase equipment from a central facility.The increase is obviously an exceptional measure and it was a decision taken quickly by Ipsa to assist during this exceptional time of crisis.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseColum Eastwood FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappColum EastwoodA spokeswoman for the SDLP, which has two MPs including party leader Colum Eastwood, said the cash will be a welcome boostneeded.The allowance is designed to allow MPs and staff to work effectively from home, she said.If we need to access it to enable us to provide an effective constituency service we will.Stephen Farry, who is the Alliance Party#s only representative at Westminster, said he did not think he would need to access the additional coronavirus fund.This is a decision taken independently from MPs and its purpose is to facilitate remote working, he said.I am committed to ensuring Parliament canand meet virtually during this crisis, with constructive scrutiny and accountability more important than ever.

Amniotic fluid, cord blood, neonatal throat swabs, placenta swabs, genital fluid and breastmilk samples from Covid- infected mothers have so far tested negative for the virus.

In this situation you should contact your maternity care team.Are all antenatal appointments going ahead as normal in Northern Ireland If you are well at the moment and have had no complications in your previous pregnancies arrangements for your care may be altered but they are still important to attend.If you have a routine scan or visit due in the coming days, you will still need to attend but the appointment may change due to staffing requirements. Maternity care is essential to reduce complications in mothers and babies. Even in the context of coronavirus, it is important that pregnant women continue to attend their scheduled routine care when they are well.Pregnant women will be asked to keep the number of people with you to a minimum. This will include being asked to attend maternity appointments alone.There may also be a need to reduce the number of routine antenatal visits.If women have an urgent problem related to the pregnancy but not related to coronavirus, they should get in touch using the same emergency contact details they already have. They should not contact that number unless they have an urgent problem.If women have symptoms of coronavirus, they should contact their maternity service and they will arrange the right place and time for the visits. They should not attend a routine clinic.What risks are there of an expectant mother contracting Covid- on a trip to hospital for an antenatal appointment Maternity care is essential and has been developed over many years with improving success to reduce complications in mothers and babies. The risks of not attending care include harm to mother, her baby or both.Many provisions have been put in place to reduce risk to mothers. These include reducing the number of visits to the hospital to a minimum, advice to mothers on reducing the number of people travelling with mothers to the hospital, attending the appointments alone, keeping numbers reduced in waiting rooms, spacing patients in waiting areas, staff taking additional protective efforts to reduce transmission in clinics with hand washing, cleaning equipment etc.How prepared are hospitals to deal with pregnant women with the virus Very signicant changes have been occurring in hospitals over the past weeks to deal with pregnant women with Covid-. Signicant changes have been made in all areas of the hospital, from clinics to wards and including delivery suites. Practice drills are being run frequently to train staff, additional resources have been brought in to help and a huge effort has been made by all levels of non-clinical, clinical, administrative and management staff.If the mother of a baby has symptoms or tests positive for Covid-, should she isolate herself from the baby Given the current limited evidence, we advise that women and healthy infants, not otherwise requiring neonatal care, are kept together in the immediate post-partum period.A risks benefits discussion with neonatologists and families to inidualise care in babies who may be more susceptible is recommended.Can a new mother with the virus breastfeed The main risk of breastfeeding for infants is the close contact with the mother, who is likely to share infective droplets. In the light of the current evidence, it is advised that the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh any potential risks of transmission of the virus through breastmilk. Precautions should be taken to reduce spread to the baby such as, hand washing before touching the baby, avoiding coughing or sneezing on the baby while feeding, and considering wearing a face mask,available, while feeding or caring for the baby.Can a pregnant person be accompanied by a partner or have visitors A person in labour can be accompanied by one birthing partner, according to the new guidelines. No visitors are permitted in ante-natal or post-natal ward areas.Will babies continue to be delivered in all Northern Ireland hospitals No, not at Causeway Hospital in Coleraine. Antenatal services will continue but it is not possible to deliver babies in the hospital during this surge period.This is due to a lack skilled paediatricians available to provide emergency care to a baby born in distress throughout the  hour period. To protect the wellbeing of mothers and babies, women booked to deliver in Causeway will be contacted and have their delivery transferred to Antrim or Altnagelvin Hospital.Should parents introduce their newborn to friends and family Current government guidance is that you should not meet with people outside your household, so no family celebrations are permitted at present.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

She said to do so was saving lives. Health Minister Robin Swann added: None of us should break or bend the rules this Easter. We must all stay at home.

There was more concern, he said, with theof time medics were having to wear them.The Department for Health said the order had not been confirmed.In a statement it added: It is entirely right for officials to scrutinise and test any such proposals, stressing the need for due diligence and emphasising that any procurement must be compatible with NHS four nations arrangements.The development comes after Finance Minister Conor Murphy faced criticism over his public pronouncements about a signicant consignment expected to arrive as part of a joint order with Dublin.It was later reported there was no order placed. Mr Murphy said bidders from India and the US muscled out Northern Ireland in the global race to buy PPE.

It#s been an extremely strange time, he says. For the guts of three weeks now I#ve barely been out of the house. The one exception was at the weekend when my we and I drove over to my daughter#s house nearby to look through the window at three of our seven grandchildren.You see, we have a new grandson who is three weeks old so we were able to take a look at him through the glass, evenwe couldn#t hold him.The coronavirus situation has had a huge impact on us, like it has on everyone . In a way I feel like we#re very lucky because we#re out in the country and we have plenty of room in the garden to get out and get a bit of air.Some days I feel asI#m competing to have the best mown lawn in the country, I#m tidying it up that much. We#ll be able to play golf on it before long. And I#m doing wee quirky things too, like a bit more cooking and bingeing on box sets.But it has been dficult too. For  years I#ve run a business, a factory  yards from my house where we create bespoke kitchens and furniture. We have  employees. So for  years that#s been my lestyle.I#ve been up and about, in and out of my work and the house from .am until pm in the evening, or later, but we furloughed the business on March , the day after the lockdown came into effect.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDeclan with his we Maria and granddaughter Moya before the lockdown FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDeclan with his we Maria and granddaughter Moya before the lockdownIt was a very upsetting thing to do, especially thinking about all the people we had to send home from their jobs.It#s the biggest call I can remember making in all that time but I think it was the right thing to do to protect us all for when we come out of this thing.I#m in a high-risk category for Covid- because I#ve got a heart condition, which was detected quite recently.I was due to have a procedure soon to deal with it, but because of everything that#s going on it#s been cancelled for now.I decided to isolate myself even before the government lockdown, so I haven#t been into Newry in more than two weeks, which is very strange.Normally I#d be in and out of the town at least once or twice a day, so I am feeling the effect of this in a big way. I#m in the house on my own quite a bit because my we is carrying on going to her work in the hospital.It#s strange to have my routine completely knocked on the head.From days when I#d be so busy morning to night with people milling around all the time in and out of the factory, it#s become very quiet and there#s a lot less activity going on.I#m doing some work in the house on my laptop, bits of admin and keeping in touch with my son who also works in the business.But compared to what it was, it#s very dferent. My we and I were supposed to be going to New York with our daughter and son-in-law a few days before St Patrick#s Day, but we cancelled. I#m relieved we did because the situation over there seems to be dire, and at least we avoided getting caught up in it or bringing it back home with us.The thing about it all is that, while it#s strange and dficult to adjust to, I think it will have a lasting impact. It#s definitely made me sit up and think what was all the rushing about for. If we#re lucky to come through it all then maybe it#s time to have a look at it and change our perspectives a bit.As well as my we working in the NHS, my daughter is a consultant up in the Royal in Belfast, so it#s a worrying time. It#s certainly made me sit back and take stock.We don#t really need the foreign holidays or to be so busy in our lives all the time. What we actually need is to slow down and realise what matters - our families, our health, a good quality of le in our local areas.It#s been a huge wake-up call and a huge chance to make some serious changes when this very dficult situation comes to an end.‘Living in a fth floor flat, we feel trapped.

It#s been hard for all of us, and especially because I#d be classed as a high-risk person. I had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer four years ago, and while I#m about to hit four years clear it won#t be until the five-year mark that I#ll be able to feel truly confident.My immune system took a real knock through the treatment so when everything started to become more serious with the coronavirus outbreak we knew it was going to be major.When you have cancer, you learn to take every day as it comes and try to avoid going down the road of stressing about everything because it really doesn#t help.Living in the high-rises at the minute really isn#t easy. Daisy and I don#t get out - except that I get to leave the flat to do some volunteering at the Dunanney Centre to help other people in the Rathcoole community. But other than that, Daisy and I are pretty much stuck inside.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseDaisy looks out the window FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDaisy looks out the windowDave is a key worker so he#s carried on as he works in distribution for animal feed. He#s the only one of us really going anywhere.We have three bedrooms in the flat, with a separate bathroom and toilet, a living room and a kitchen.It#s quite good in size compared to what some other people have, but being trapped inside all the time makes you realise just how small it is. We don#t have a garden to open the back door into. We don#t have a balcony, and our windows have latches on them so they only open a very small crack.You can take the latches offyou need to, but for now with Daisy so young I don#t even want to go there, so we keep the latches on. I keep the blinds pulled right back so any sunshine there is can get in, and the windows are open a crack for some air, but that#s it really. It will be hard as the weather gets nicer.There are communal areas outside, and we have communal lts to get you down there. Butwe do that then we#re running the risk of being in close contact with other people, and none of us know who may have symptoms or could have been exposed to this.Not getting out into the fresh air is very dficult. I suppose it#s getting me down a bit, and the longer it goes on the more I#m feeling a bit anxious. But I know it#s the right thing to do. Luckily Daisy has taken it really well. She#s not at the point where she#s tearing her hair out wanting to get outside. She misses the park and getting to school with her friends, but she#s been really understanding and accepting of the situation.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseJillian with husband Dave FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappJillian with husband DaveHer school was great in explaining a bit about the coronavirus so she knows we#re inside to stay safe and that it won#t last forever.What I#m desperate for is to be able to take Daisy to the park. Normally we stop off on the way home from school so she can have a run about for  minutes before we go home to do her homework, but now everything is limited to inside.We#re still doing some exercise. She really enjoys dancing and we put music on and she makes up dances and practices her cartwheels. I#ve got my stepper on my phone, and we go walking around between rooms to get our steps up.It#s actually been fine because we#re just doing our best to fill our days, and be flexible with it. I think trying to impose a strict timetable on ourselves just wouldn#t work, because this just isn#t a normal time.Our usual routine is completely gone. I don#t work, but I volunteer in the community as a Listening Ear and at other groups, and between that and school as well as Daisy#s Girls# Brigade we usually have a lot to keep ourselves busy.For now though we#re just trying our best, like everyone . When Dave is off he#s doing wee cookery classes with Daisy, and as well as that we#re trying to do a bit of school work every day because she#s always really enjoyed learning. I don#t want that to be something she loses because of all this.The next thing to think about is Daisy#s birthday, which is later this month, a couple of days after mine. We#ve told her she#s going to be like the Queen, with two birthdays in .She#ll have a small one at home with me and her daddy and then a lovely big one later on when all of this stuff comes to an end.

What I have been saying all along is the need to try to look at the cumulative effect, he said.Mr Kinahan suggested that each new application is just seen as one.He also questioned the ability of Ballyclare#s sewerage network to cope with any new housing developments.He said he has written to the Department of Infrastructure to highlight the issue of sewerage.According to a recent letter sent to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council by NI Water, half of Northern Ireland#s sewers will be full by  and wastewater treatment works in more than  areas across Northern Ireland are at or rapidly approaching full capacity and where NI Water is unlikely to be able to accept additional sewer connections.Northern Ireland#s wastewater infrastructure is at serious risk and nearly every main urban area is impacted, the letter stated. The council was told that these areas include Belfast, Ballymena, Carrickfergus, Larne, Antrim and Ballyclare.The letter continued: The economic consequences are clear with new housing, businesses, schools, hospitals and tourism all seriously affected. We are now facing a tipping point and collectively need to urgently make decisions about the structure of funding of NI Waterwe are to continue to provide the water and sewerage services which are expected in a healthy economy.According to the Belfast politan Area Plan , almost  hectares of land have been zoned for housing on the site of the former basalt quarry overall.The Plan says that public infrastructure and road improvements are expected to include provision for cycle and pedestrian links to Ballyeaston Road and Ballycorr Road.The proposed new houses will front onto Ballycorr Road and Ballyeaston Road. The Plan has stated that a proposed development on the former quarry site should include provision for a local neighbourhood centre to include local retail outlets and community facilities.A multi-purpose hall and a #Healthy Living Centre# to accommodate medical and fitness facilities have been suggested. All existing trees, shrubs and hedgerows within the site and on boundaries must be retained and construction will not be permitted between March and July in a bid to limit disturbance to breeding peregrine falcons.A geology report by Earth Science Conservation Review has stated that the best exposures of the lower basalt formation in the Ballyclare area are to be found at Craighill Quarry.Belfast Most ReadCoronavirus: PSNI probe gathering for ex-Sinn Fein councillor#s funeralWidow tells of grief over crash victim Matthew Arnold who had just become a new fatherDon#t take Lisburn anti-NHS graffiti personally, MLA Butler urges health workersCoronavirus: Police to display #dferent approach and attitude# over Easter weekendMotorcyclist who died in Armagh crash had become dad for first time,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Dr Kyle, who recently came out of retirement to help in the fight against coronavirus, said a close family member should be trained in how to use PPE so they can spend the last few hours of a loved one#s le caring for them. Saying goodbye to a parent or a spouse or a child, caring for them in the last few hours of their le, it is profoundly signicant for any one of us, said Dr Kyle, speaking to the BBC#s Newsline programme. In the course of our lives there are few things that are more important - so to have a blanket ban and say that nobody can be with their relative in the last few hours of their le needs to be looked at again, he said. Clearly there are practical challenges but the way it would work would be that one family member, a close family member, would be trained in how to put on and how to take off PPE and would spend the last few hours beside their loved one at the end of their le. To be able to say goodbye is really important, he said. It comes as  further people were confirmed have died in Northern Ireland after contracting coronavirus on Friday.It brings the total number of deaths across the region to  people. In response, the Department of Health said that intensive care is not a safe place for members of the public.

We will actively be promoting virtual visits through mobile devices.It emerged on Friday that Stormont#s health and finance departments are expected to place a £m order for PPE on Tuesday. The BBC#s Nolan Show said funds have been set aside for a £m deposit with a Chinese state firm, but leaked documents reveal concerns the goods may not be high enough quality. Items on the order include . million facemasks,  million respirator masks and  million in both aprons and visors.There are also concerns over the danger of being in competition with NI#s main supply route via the UK government.The funds being used to place the order were originally set aside for a failed order with Dublin but have now been allocated to a new supply route found by Northern Ireland officials in China. At the Health Committee on Thursday, chief social worker Sean Holland said there were no concerns over the quality of current PPE stocks. There was more concern, he said, with theof time medics were having to wear them.The Department for Health said the order had not been confirmed.In a statement it added: It is entirely right for officials to scrutinise and test any such proposals, stressing the need for due diligence and emphasising that any procurement must be compatible with NHS four nations arrangements.Meanwhile, a clinical lead in the Republic of Ireland has told a press conference on Sunday a Chinese batch of PPE was not suitable to be worn.Northern Ireland had been expected to share in one of the most recent batches of PPE delivered in the Republic, before plans for a deal fell through. Staff in Tallaght Hospital in Dublin were sent an email on Monday stating they were to wear surgical face masks around Covid- patients.But Professor Michael Cormican, national clinical lead for Health Care Associated Infections, said the masks sent from China were a defenceless barrier against Covid-, and as much use as a paper towel.These are the poorest quality elasticated ear-loop facemasks, he said.In a statement, a Tallaght Hospital spokesperson said: The Dublin Midlands Hospital Group and Tallaght University Hospital take the safety and protection of staff very seriously and this includes ensuring goods supplied meet the necessary standards of the HSE, and as specied by the WHO.The supply of PPE is a national and international challenge. All hospitals... are working every day to ensure hospitals have adequate and quality approved supplies.Any staff member who has concerns with regard to PPE should raise it with their clinical director in the first instance.A statement from the HSE said: Many clinicians are understandably very concerned for their own safety and that of their patients, colleagues and family.Some believe that wearing gloves, masks and other protective equipment in all situations will make them and their patients safer.However, the key to protecting patients and staff from infection to the greatest degree possible is to follow the whole package of infection prevention precautions. The most important parts of this in all settings are hand hygiene, respiratory hygiene and cough etiquette and regular cleaning.The recommendation that all staff should wear a surgical mask for all patient encounters and meetings between staff is not supported by current evidence and is not consistent with the current national guidance.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ffd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cfabb-efa--bfa-acbbfaab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ffd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cfabb-efa--bfa-acbbfaab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ffd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cfabb-efa--bfa-acbbfaab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ffd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cfabb-efa--bfa-acbbfaab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland ffd .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_cfabb-efa--bfa-acbbfaab_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"VideoNorthern IrelandArlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill lead calls for people to stay at homeNorthern Ireland’s First Minister has warned those who flout social distancing rules over the Easter holidays that they should expect police action.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w,https:www.belfasttelegraph incoming e .ece AUTOCROP wh BT_K.jpg w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandCoronavirus: PSNI launch online reporting portal after  complaints on social distancing breachesThe PSNI has launched an online portal for members of the public to report incidents where social distancing rules are not being followed.Most ReadCoronavirus: PSNI probe gathering for ex-Sinn Fein councillor#s funeralWidow tells of grief over crash victim Matthew Arnold who had just become a new fatherDon#t take Lisburn anti-NHS graffiti personally, MLA Butler urges health workersCoronavirus: Police to display #dferent approach and attitude# over Easter weekendMotorcyclist who died in Armagh crash had become dad for first time,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Castledawson man Jason is currently renting a flat on Ireton Street, off Botanic Avenue near Queen’s University in south Belfast with three other students. Jason said his letting agency were unsympathetic to the students’ situation, saying there was nothing they could do. He told Derry Now: “They said it wasn’t their problem – that was what guarantors were for. “The situation is that they won’t give us any sort of leeway in terms of paying it when they know we’re not in the house due to university being cancelled. googletag.cmd.push “They’ve said it’s not their problem because it’s privately rented and I understand that to a point, but common sense has to kick in somewhere.” Jason and his flatmates are renting their accommodation through USPM Ltd, a letting agent based on University Road and say they had to initiate contact about Covid-. “There’s very little contact with the letting agency unless you miss or have to arrange a payment. They hadn’t contacted us about the pandemic, we had to do the ringing,” said Jason. “I rang them, and our contact said they understood the frustration but there was nothing they could do. To them, we were renting a house in Belfast to live in. googletag.cmd.push “Our landlords are usually dead on, butthey had any sort of generosity, they could do something. It’s not always up to the person on the end of the phone.” While Jason is able to fall back on the support of his family, he realises not everyone has that support available. He said: “I have a few friends who wouldn’t come home as much, they don’t have a stable home to come home to and they’re paying rent through jobs in Belfast. “A lot of them were in part-time jobs and have now been laid off. They have no way to continue that, no income. It’s not a good situation for them.” Jason believes the ‘mortgage holidays’ mooted by the government could provide the solution to the problem, but that the options did not appear to be being explored. “Anybody renting privately is just being made to pay. There are no mortgage holidays coming into play,” he said. “We’re probably now having to pay- months where we aren’t there whereas we had been in years gone by. That’s probably half the year of not being in the house and having to pay for it. “If they can take mortgage holidays, there is absolutely no reason for us to be paying rent, except for making a profit.” Derry Now contacted UPSM Ltd for a response, but none was available at the time of going to print.

Derry Trades Union Council chair, Niall McCarroll, said: The global Covid- crisis means we cant celebrate May Day, the international workers day, in the way we normally would. This year we were working with Derry and Strabane Council to host a Workers Rights and Social Justice Week culminating with the May Day march and rally. The Covid- crisis is causing tremendous pain and hardship. We are in the midst of a tragedy that we hope will end as soon as possible with as few deaths as possible. googletag.cmd.push The response to the crisis has also put a spotlight on the inadequacy of government action, the state of our public services and the central role of workers saving lives, protecting communities and allowing society to . Many in the political establishment have joined claps in recent weeks for our heroic nurses and frontline workers but they have spent the last decades justying poverty wages, undermining trade union representation and dismantling our public services, including our health service. The hypocrisy is glaring. Governments have described the battle to contain Covid- as a war but theyve sent frontline workers out without PPE and testing. Far too many employers have risked workplace and public safety by refusing to implement public health guidelines. Workers have been forced to take strike action to make sure health guidelines are followed. googletag.cmd.push Its crucial we put a focus on the heroic efforts of workersresponding to this crisis, on the need for workers rights and on the central importance of our public services. The Derry Trades Union Council is calling on everyone to mark this May Day by joining a Five Minutes of Noise for Workers Rights at pm on Friday May st - and by putting up red flags and signs for workers rights from homes and workplaces for  hours. Well be working with unions, community groups, equality campaigners, artists and others that we were collaborating with for the Workers Rights and Social Justice Week to organise as much as possible through social media. We will be launching our Workers Charter - our vision for dignity, respect and justice at work, in communities and for a more equal society. Were calling on the trade unions and organisations supporting workers rights across Ireland, North and South, to join this effort. People from all backgrounds and communities deserve workers rights,dignity and equality. We want this event to be as inclusive as possible. We need to begin to shape a new way of doing things thats centred around recognising the value of workers and the needs of the working class communities.

Anyone caught neglecting to clean up after their dogs can now be issued with an pound fine and the council has wasted no time in getting the message across along some of the citys most popular walkways. Recently, Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council, Councillor Michaela Boyle, reminded the public of the need to take responsibility for their pets following an increase in the instances of dog fouling in recent weeks. Government measures to reduce the spread of the Covid  virus by limiting when the public can leave their home has led to an increase in walkers in local parks, greenways and public footpaths and with it more dog foul for Councils Cleansing teams to clean up. googletag.cmd.push Mayor Boyle urged dog owners to show respect for public health and other parks and greenway users when walking their pets. The vast majority of dog owners are conscientious and clean up after their dogs but there has been a noted increase in fouling since the new stay at home measures were introduced,” she said. Dog excrement left on our streets and parks poses a serious public health hazard and is putting extra pressure on our Cleansing team at this dficult time.  I would appeal to all owners to carry a bag to lt the dirt and dispose ofit in a designated dog bin where possible or in a black bin. googletag.cmd.push “Similarly, owners are reminded that when in designated pedestrian zones, dogs must be on a lead held by someone who is able to control it and owners should be mindful of other dogs and members of the public who could be scared of animals.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Kieran Stevenson was man of the match in their win over Antrim and Michael McMullan spoke with the Derry keeper, as he rekindled the memories of their golden era.

There was time for Antrim to cast the dice one last time. Gary OKane composed himself over a stoppage time sideline cut. The wind carried the sliotar into the danger-zone, where vigilant Derry goalkeeper Kieran Stevenson deflected it wide. It was the last action and the final whistle kick-started an outpouring of emotion for the new Ulster champions. Bullfrog was the keeper in Banaghers three-in-a-row winning minor team, before moving into the county scene. An -year career began in , as understudy to Laveys Fergal Shorty McNally.

From that team, captain Colin McEldowney, Benny Ward, Mickey Conway, Gary Biggs and Geoffrey McGonigle would help spearhead Derry seniors towards Division One. The minors lost in the final that year, to the Saffrons, by an almost identical margin and Stevenson was the keeper on both teams. In , the Us took Antrim to a replay and  frees from the unerring Dermot Doherty, on his own Emmet Park turf, finished the job as Derry took the title in mid-week extra-time thriller. “That was a good win,” Stevenson recalls. “Antrim were always the team to beat, in terms of the county.” Things began to change. They ran Antrim to three points in the  senior final, but lost convincingly the following year. It was a spell in hurlings top tier that made the wheels of change turn that bit quicker.

The cream of hurling was lting Derrys standards. A -point slump to Tipperary, in Thurles, was their toughest afternoon. A one-point defeat in Laois was the one that got away, leaving Derry needing to beat Kerry in a relegation play-off to stay afloat before dropping down at end of the  campaign. “I think it as the Division One hurling that stuck to us and we were on an upward curve,” Stevenson feels. “There were more players added to the . “Derry hurlingwas about filling up the numbers and going out to play the matches. Then it changed and everybody was taking it serious. The club scene was improving and you could see the skill level going up from  to .” HARMONY In an interview three years ago, Conor Murray painted the Derry hurling scene he played on at the start of the noughties as a family. A unique one, with club rivalry left at the gates of Owenbeg and picked up on the way home. Stevenson agrees. “No club stuck to themselves, everybody got on well with everybody,” he said. Other managers werent chirping in players ears, telling them not to commit to the small ball game. In the  season, Kieran McKeever threw his lot in with the hurlers, while also playing in an Ulster football final weeks later. “Players were not restricted in playing for the county, in terms of hurling and everybody gelled,” Stevenson added A mountain of upside-down kit bags would be erected in the aisle of the team bus, with a coat thrown over it. Hey presto, they had a card table, around which they laughed on their journey to whatever battle they would later brace themselves for. It got more advanced when Stevenson, a kitchen manufacturer by trade, patented a custom-made card table. “When we were coming home, we were arm-wrestling on it and it was all a bit of craic,” he joked.  Emmett McKeever, Kieran McKeever and Geoffrey McGonigle celebrate Derrys  Ulster title. Steering the ship was Cushendall man Kevin McNaughton. After spending time helping foster Swatraghs structures and leading them to back to back intermediate championships, he came on board with Derry at the start of the  season. His trusted lieutenant, from the Swa, Roger Anthony Quinn, Laveys hurling godfather Tom Magill, Banaghers Gerard McCloskey and athletics coach Malcolm McCausland made up the management team. Heading up the M for the  final, Derry were in a decent place, following a - to - win over a Down team who had beaten New York in the quarter-final. Antrim were -point winners over London in their semi-final, but Derry blitzed them in the first half of the decider. Rookie defenders Emmett OHara and Declan McKillop were led a merry dance by the Derry attack. Ace attacker Geoffrey McGonigle and Emmett McKeever were missing through suspension. That told enough of the depth in Derrys squad. “We were getting better with playing all the better teams. There was plenty of skill, speed and fitness in the team. It was about trying to put it all together...it was a good ,” Stevenson explained. McKeever had been suspended after being sent off with Downs Noel Sands in the semi-final, on the advice of a linesman. With high-ranking officials on their July holidays, the appeal – lodged before the end of June – wasnt heard and McKeever would miss the final. “Beefywas our best player in defence...he was lethal,” Stevenson said of his captain. “We wanted to try and win it for him because he was hard done by. He was well-liked and in every match, hed have put his head in front of the hurl to stop the ball. “Antrim had Alistair Elliott, Gregory OKane was full-forward and Gary OKane started at centre half-forward, before going back .” DREAM START Kieran McKeever, Gary Biggs and Ollie Collins hit first half goals to leave Antrims foundations rocking. The Saffrons didnt score from play for  minutes. “We shouldve been further ahead,” said Stevenson of their - to - interval lead. “We had missed a pile of scoring opportunities and we were against the breeze in the second half. “We knewthe forwards were getting on the ball, they could score goals because they were skilful and quick.” Derrys backs were to the wall as Antrim notched  unanswered points and, with  minutes gone, went four points ahead. Derry replied with points to take the wind out of Antrims sails. Their case was helped further when John ODywer finished to the net for the crucial fourth Oakleafers goal. “It was the goals that won us the match,” Stevenson said. “I still have a hurling ball in the house, with the scorewritten on it.” All the press cuttings and programmes were kept too. A raft of memories from the glory years. But the hurl that deflected Gary OKanes last minute sideline cut to safety is long gone. “Some wee Belfast boy stole it,” Stevenson reckons. The Derry squad threw their history-making hurls on the turf to celebrate and within minutes they had vanished. “When the final was blown, it was more thepressure, you were always checking the time to see what was left. If the game had went onthere was less likelihood that we couldve won the game.” Conor Murray accepted the cup in the stand, before taking it down to the pitch for the suspended Emmett McKeever to again hoist it skywards to salute the magical moment. “We were there on merit,” was Stevensons assessment of their win. “We had a good defence and a good forward line. When you take the likes of John ODwyer, Geoffrey and Mickey Collins as your front three – you have a good side. “Conor Murray at full-back was safe, you had Collieand Niall Mullan in the corners.” Stevenson picked up the man of the match award and added to it with the Ulster hurler of the year accolade the following season when Derry retained their title. Later that night, the team partied into the wee small hours in Dungiven club. You could barely turn a sweet in your mouth. It was jam packed. Before that, on the joyous journey home, there was a poignant moment when the players got off the bus to carry the cup over the River Bann in Toome. “We had talked about it in previous years – the days when we were beaten,” Stevenson remembers. “It was a short walk, the boys were more interested in getting on the bus and heading on home.” Derrys fallow  years was over.

As one might expect there’s a strong representation from multiple John McLaughlin winners Ballinderry, Slaughtneil and Coleraine but I can’t believe some of the players that I have left out. However, I’m pretty sure thatan imaginary club was able to field this line-out in their prime, they’d not be far off lting the Andy Merrigan Cup. googletag.cmd.push  - MichaelConlan - Ballinderry A fixture between the sticks for Ballinderry for almost two decades, Mickey C was a good goalkeeper at the start of his career when winning an All-Ireland club medal in . By the s he seemed even better, maintaining a physical condition that would have been the envy of men  years his junior and adjusting to a massive transformation in what was expected from a modern goalkeeper. He just edges out Slaughtneil’s Antoin McMullan for the number one jersey.  - Karl McKaigue – Slaughtneil Karl might not be as well know as his elder brother, but he has been just as vital in Slaughtneil’s success. The archetype of the modern defender, who must meld man-marking skills with ability on the ball, McKaigue is often the initiation point for the Emmett’s attack. Has held some of the finest forwards in club football scoreless during Slaughtneil’s rise to national prominence including Conleith Gilligan, Ryan McHugh and Seanie Johnston. googletag.cmd.push  - Brendan Rogers Slaughtneil Another Emmets dual star Rogers, has been the defensive rock on which Slaughtneil’s success has been built. Named Ulster Club footballer of the year for , as a youngster Rogers initially chose to focus on hurling but has established himself as one of the football’s best defenders in not just Derry but Ulster, an automatic pick for this selection.  - Ciaran Mullan - Coleraine A superb athlete whose ball-carrying ability and pace have made him a nightmare for opposing forwards who end up spending much of their time tracking back into their own half. A key man as Coleraine claimed the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time in  and was still a fixture when they claimed their second title in .  - Kevin McGuckin - Ballinderry Another Ballinderry man with an All-Ireland medal in his pocket, the fact he was still making the starting  for the Shamrocks in  is testament to his qualities. A Rolls Royce of a footballer the former Derry captain’s experience was crucial as the Loughshore completed a hat-trick of victories between  and .  - Oisin Duffy - Foreglen It’s a measure of Oisin Duffy’s consistent excellence that he makes this selection based on performances in the Intermediate Championship. Could play any position in the backline, his strength and pace made him an effective man marker but equally comfortable in possession. Still as effective as ever as Foreglen claimed the Intermediate crown last October.  - Chrissy McKaigue - Slaughtneil First rose to prominence on the Derry minor side that reached the All-Ireland final in  the current Derry Captain has been a fixture for club and county for a decade. In addition to his evident abilities as a player, McKaigue provides the intangible qualities of leadership that every successful team needs. On the rare occasions that Slaughtneil find themselves floundering McKaigue is the man to whom his team-mates look to steady the ship.  - Patsy Bradley - Slaughtneil Another who’s career has spanned the ages, Patsy Bradley is an icon of Derry football. The quintessential quiet, hard man, Bradley’s aerial prowess rarely fails to catch the eye and his work-rate is immense. Has overcome injuries that might have restricted the career of lesser players Patsy’s toughness is the stuff of legend.  - Niall Holly - Coleraine Strong in the air and extremely mobile. Holly’s ball carrying skills have the been the starting point for countless Eoghan Rua attacks, with his languid style belying and athleticism allows him to glide past opponents. A perfect foil for the combative Bradley.  - Enda Muldoon - Ballinderry One of the most gted footballers ever to apply a boot to a size five, the Shamrocks man’s gts appeared to immune to the passing of the years as Ballinderry emulated their s antecedents in winning three in a row from  to . His ball to Raymond Wilkinson for the decisive goal in the  semi-final win over Banagher may be the best pass I have ever seen in club football.  - Benny Heron- Ballinascreen The only man in my team who doesn’t have some form of Championship winners medal to show for his efforts. Heron has been a prolic scorer for a Ballinascreen team that has regularly been in the mix for the John McLaughlin Cup without quite sealing the deal. With his phenomenal work rate and ability to score from both play and placed balls, Heron was a key factor in the St Colm’s club’s run to the  and  county finals.  - Sean Leo McGoldrick - Coleraine The oil that has kept the Coleraine engine running smoothly for a decade. Adaptable players can sometimes be the victims of their own versatility but Sean Leo McGoldrick’s quality is such that every manager in Derry would love to have him in their squad. One Coleraine mentor once told me that the one time in any game when he could relax was when Sean Leo had the ball because he knew it was secure. An incisive runner and an accurate passer the Eoghan Rua man can also chip in with a vital score when the occasion requires.  - Coilin Devlin - Ballinderry The flame-haired front man maybe didn’t have the profile of the other Ballinderry forward in this line-up but his impact for the Shamrocks in the early part of the decade was undeniable, bagged the decisive goal in the  final against Slaughtneil, and scored five points from play to earn man of the match honours in . Dooks pace and direct running made him a handful for opposing corner-backs.  - Colm McGoldrick - Coleraine The second member of the McGoldrick clan to make my team and you could make case for the inclusion of any of the brothers, but Colm is well worth his place. He was the fulcrum of the Eoghan Rua attack as they claimed their first county crown in . The intelligence of his movement is something that can’t be taught. As captain he scored four points in the  final as Coleraine doubled their tally of John McLaughlin Cups.  - Shane McGuigan - Slaughtneil The sharpest shooter in Derry club football in recent year. McGuigan’s scoring tallies speak for themselves scored - in the  Derry Championship and better that tally with - in . Performs well on the big stage top scored in the  Ulster final with - against Kilcoo and bagged - in ’s provincial triumph over Cavan Gaels. Every successful team needs a marquee man in their full-forward line, McGuigan is Slaughtneil’s. RELATED - Michael McMullan selects his Derry club team of the decade- Click here...

I went off to my daughter’s school and got everything sorted out and then came out home. “I thought we’d all go to the beach a run and walk the dogs to get away from the chaos for an hour, but I wasn’t in the house ten minutes until the police landed.” Maggie immediately realised her mistake when the police officers appeared, and they accompanied her back to Tesco so she could pay her bill. googletag.cmd.push However, once she had paid the outstanding amount at the Customer Service Desk, she was waved over by the store’s security guard. She said: “The security man was talking to what turned out to be a manager and he waved me over. I went over and told him I was sorry and that I had made a mistake. “The first thing he did was flip a notepad open and start tapping with a pen. He said he would need my name, address and date of birth. I said I’d already given that to the police. “I explained that I wanted to come in and recty it and that the police were sitting outsideneeded, but he handed me a Notice of Intended Civil Recovery.” The notice explained that Tesco’s solicitors could write to Maggie to recover the costs of investigating the incident, and there was further punishment in store. “They said I was barred for a year.

The day before I’d spent pound and the day before that I’d spent pound. “It was all kept in the public eye, they didn’t take me into a room or anything. I didn’t care though, because I was doing the right thing. “Where is their compassion, their humanity  Especially at a time like this. I came back to fix this, and they treated me like a criminal.” The County Derry Post contacted Tesco for a response, but none was available at the time of going to print.

Aodhan Curran often draws sketches of people, both living and deceased. Families of those who have received one of Aodhans drawings say that it has brought them great comfort. As a result, the -year-old, who is currently studying to become a teacher, has offered to do a sketch of anyone who passes away from the virus. He has already been contacted by one family and within days of the person passing away, Aodhan had left the drawing at their home. He said the family were very thankful of the gesture. googletag.cmd.push “It is only a small thing but I think many of the families affected will get some comfort from it,” he said. Aodhan, who lives at Jacqueline Way in Derry, said he had always been interested in art. “I am studying to be a technology and design teacher at Ulster University in Coleraine but I have always loved art and doing sketches. “Over the years, I have done loads of drawings of people. “My uncle, Robbie Kennelly, died a few years ago and I did a drawing of him after he passed away. “His we, my aunt Margo, says the drawing is so special for her and it is lovely to hear that. googletag.cmd.push “From talking to other families, they love the sketches I have done for them and I just thought this would be a nice thing to do for some of the families of those who lose a loved one to coronavirus.” Aodhan said the circumstances surrounding the virus made it particularly dficult for families. “The people who area very ill with the virus are in the hospital on their own and then often die without their family being present. “And then there is the funeral service at which only a small number of people can attend. “It is a very dficult process for families to go through and many more will have to experience it over the next few weeks and months. “If my drawings can bring families even a small bit of comfort then I will be more than happy to help.” Any families who would like to contact Aodhan, can get in touch with him through his Facebook page Aodhan Curran Art.

Even in defeat, it was Derry who stole the show. What was supposed to be a Sunday stroll for Offaly turned out to be nothing of the sort as Derry flew the underdog flag with real pride. At the midpoint of the second half, Derry were level and pressing, and it took a strong finish by the overwhelming favourites to earn a six-point cushion at the end. Offaly’s manager, Pat Fleury, readily admitted that his team would have to make enormous improvements before the semi-final against Cork. googletag.cmd.push The truth is, Derry were always in contention in this game despite the dire predictions of a massacre. Geoffrey McGonigle ed from suspension to rattle in two goals and the full forward line of Gary Biggs, Michael Collins and John O’Dwyer scored - among them. There were high-class performances at midfield from Ronan McCloskey and Oliver Collins, and at the back, Derry held both John Troy and Gary Hannfy scoreless. We came down here to win, said manager Kevin McNaughton. We know we are not that far away and I always thought we were in with a chance, we were hurling so well. googletag.cmd.push There was the feeling throughout the first half that Offaly always had the upper hand, but once McGonigle pounced for goals in the final quarter, the complexion of the contest changed. Brian Whelahan had been left out of the starting lineup due to a hamstring strain, but he was quickly pitched into service to shore up a leaky defense, and Joe Errity was also sent into the action. Their presence had the desired effect as Derry managed only two scores in the closing stages, while Offaly had five points and a vital goal by Brendan Murphy. Derry were five points in arrears at the changeover, but they had the advantage of the breeze to come. McGonigle got the first of his goals when he latched on to Kieran McKeever’s probing delivery, and then when Stephen Byrne made a save from John O’Dwyer’s shot, McGonigle was perfectly positioned to dispatch the rebound. We put in a hell of a performance, said Ollie Collins, who was forced out with injury during the second half. This our first time down here. I’m certain this team will be back at this stage of the competition and go better.

No matter where you go or who you are talking to up and down the country, they always ask about Roly. There is always someone who knows him or has played with or against him.The above paragraph was taken word for word from Drumaness Millsrsquos th anniversary booklet in . It captures brilliantly the essence of Roly lsquoThe Manrsquo.Roly died on Wednesday, March , sparking a deluge of tributes on social media. True gentleman, one in a million, what a lovely man, one and only Roly, top man, a legend mdash these tributes, among many others, appeared again and again.Roly was an integral part of village le in Drumaness, dandering to the bookies or the shop. He would make multiple stops to say hello to everyone he met, discussing the issues of the day.I have known him for a!most  years. He worked in Sam Bellrsquos egg factory across the road from St Josephrsquos Primary School in Crossgar. The workers would kick a ball about the road during their break and even to my untrained eye he was dferent class. It was my introduction to Roly lsquoThe Footballerrsquo.Some years later Roly and his brother, John, knocked on our door in Crossgar. They wanted me to play for the Mills in the Newcastle Summer League and I was more than happy to do so.Playing with Roly was a great education for a young player. He made football look easy, was stylish and talented, possessing the rare gt of keeping the game simple.Small wonder then that when talk comes around to the Millsrsquo greatest ever player, Roly is always in the conversation, despite competition from the likes of Robbie Strain, Osie Gelston, Conor Walsh and Davy Mills.Legend has it that in those days boys were born with boots on in Drumaness because this was a village where sport was king. So it was that Roly also excelled at billiards and cricket, reaching a very high standard in both.But football and the Mills were Rolyrsquos first loves and he rarely missed training or matches. Inevitably his talent came to the notice of Irish League managers and he enjoyed spells with Portadown and Cltonville in the early seventies. Nevertheless, Roly was a home bird and sooner or later he would pull on the Mills shirt again.By now I was playing for the all conquering Downpatrick Rec team of that era and we pitched up to a Border Cup final early in  to play the Mills. We had just won the Steel and Sons Cup and had our eyes firmly on the double, but Roly and Osie Gelston had other plans and proceeded to inspire the Mills to a famous - win.Roly had reached the twilight years of a glorious footballing career, but there was still time to lead the Mills reserves to another giant-killing act, beating Castlewellan in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final in .After such a stellar playing career, Roly was expected to become a manager. He did dip his toes in the managerial waters once or twice, but with no offence intended to the managerial fraternity mdash myself included mdash Roly was probably too nice to be a manager. In all the years I have known him I canrsquot remember him raising his voice. He was just so easy going, decent and level-headed.As a result people liked Roly and this popularity unsurprisingly proved to be an asset in his working le. After Sam Bells he spent a number of years working in the Co-Op shop in Drumaness before taking up employment with well-known butcher Vincy Doran.He was a familiar sight in Vincyrsquos van, delivering to hotels and restaurants, but it was his weekend door-to-door run which played to his strengths and further cemented his popularity.He became known as Butch or Butcher mdash a nickname he loved mdash and Vincy to this day has nothing but good things to say about Rolyrsquos eight-year stint with him.Rolyrsquos next stop was with Jimmy Quinn, who owned a bakery in Downpatrick. Jimmy shrewdly ed Roly to the door-to-door market and with people still finding it dficult to say no to the personable Roly, their successful liaison continued for  years.Jimmy likes nothing better than relating Roly stories,none of which can be repeated here, and like the rest of us he will remember Roly with the utmost fondness.Unfortunately Roly wasnrsquot immune to the ups and downs of le and deteriorating health curtailed his working le. He managed to fight and beat prostrate cancer a number of years ago, but this time around the lsquoBig Crsquo has claimed this lovely man.Ironically it was during these latter years that he seemed to be ever present on the streets of Drumaness, allowing him to befriend a generation entirely unaware of his past sporting prowess.Roly married Betty Rice on October , , and together they brought Noel, Pauline, Betty, Carol and Christine into the world. After almost  years together as a couple they remained best friends, as well as husband and we.Apart from my football connection to Roly, I have been his neighbour for  years and since his passing I have heard him described as lsquoMr Drumaness Millsrsquo, but for me he was Mr Drumaness full stop. This village will never be the same without him.Rolyrsquos family should be immensely proud of his impact on those who knew him and how sad it was to see coronavirus rob them and Roly of the fitting send-off he deserved.However, the good news is that I know there are plans afoot to have a celebration of his le when normality s. Nobody deserves it more. RIP Roly.Roly Hanna -.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Cormac.jpg","title":"Ardglass golfer on teeing up with the best in the world  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin could be forgiven for feeling understandably frustrated right now.The richly talented  year-old should be locking horns with some of the worldrsquos best players on the European tour.But instead of prowling the fairways hersquos holed up in his apartment in Dublin mdash like many others undergoing coronavirus lockdown.Itrsquos not how Sharvin, currently th in golfrsquos world rankings, thought his first season on the European Tour would go.Having secured his card for the  season by finishing th on the  Challenge Tour rankings, he was gearing up for a potential breakthrough campaign on the top circuit.However, after just four events, he is unsure of what the future holds as the sporting world goes into shutdown due to the coronavirus outbreak.He clearly appreciated that golf, and sport in general, is of minor importance when compared with the COVID pandemic.Of the decision to close all golf courses north and south of the border, he told the BBC recently: ldquoItrsquos a precaution that needs to be in place.I donrsquot know enough about the virus, but theyrsquore obviously trying to slow things down. Hopefully wersquoll be back playing as soon as possible, I think thatrsquos the goal.ldquoI think we just have to accept it and sit tight and when it does pass, we can get things moving a bit quicker.Certainly things have happened fairly quickly for Sharvin in his career to date. He only took up golf seriously relatively late in his teenage years, but went on to have glittering amateur career.In  he was a member of the Great Britain and Ireland Walker Cup team, contributing three points and remaining unbeaten in a .-. thumping of the United States.Sharvin turned  the following year and joined the ranks of the European Challenge Tour.Having missed his European Tour card by a single shot in , Sharvin relocated to Dublin and It proved to be the right move.He amassed eight top ten finishes in  starts to earn a rookie season on the European Tour thanks in large part to his six top fives.Sharvin only missed four cuts, two of which came in the first two events of the season, before he kickstarted his campaign with back-to-back top ten finishes.However, his best performance came at the Irish Open at Lahinch where he finished tied for th and was also the leading Irish golfer.He showed impressive consistency during the  season and proved his elite-level credentials with a tie for th finish at the Irish Open, ending the week as the leading home competitor.He says: I had a really good year, I put myself into contention a lot which was great. I think I was ready to take that step and I think the way I played, I deserved to get my card in the end with a few good results.ldquoI also managed to play well in a couple of European Tour events as well which showed me that I was ready to take that step. Therersquos a relief that I have my card now but itrsquos only the start of it mdash I know I have to keep improving and moving up the rankings.At the Irish Open he finished ahead of future Open champion Shane Lowry, Ryder Cup star Tommy Fleetwood former world number one Lee Westwood and Ryder Cup captain Padraig Harrington.ldquoIt was disappointing to shoot level-par on Sunday, but I feel like I didnrsquot do much wrong, he said.ldquoIt was really nice to have that pressure of going into the final round of a big European Tour event with a chance to win. It showed me where I was mentally and physically, that I was able to come from the Challenge Tour and compete in a top-level European Tour event.ldquoThat was an unbelievable week. The crowds were incredible and I attracted a big following being the leading Irishman, and that was a great feeling.ldquoItrsquos a nice feeling when hundreds of people are following you and everyone is willing your ball into the hole. I think that really geared me up quite a lot. It was a class buzz.ldquoIt was dficult going back to playing the Challenge Tour in the middle of nowhere in France the week after, but that week gave me the confidence to string together more good results to get off the Challenge Tour.Sharvin admits itrsquos been a slow start on the European Tour, with a tie for th in the Oman Open his bestin four starts this year, but his belief in being able to compete at the higher end of leaderboards remains undimmed.ldquoI feel like my game is good, but I havenrsquot really put all the facets together. ldquoI think in Oman I was second in strokes, gained tee-to-green and just putted really poorly. I played quite nicely in Qatar and just didnrsquot get it going.ldquoItrsquos obviously such a short period of time so itrsquos hard to assess in four events, but I feel like Irsquom close. This break may help me improve other things and hopefully Irsquom a better player when we start again.Given his Walker Cup experience, Sharvin would dearly love to play in the Ryder Cup in the years ahead.ldquoThe Ryder Cup would definitely be up there for me. I grew up playing team sports and have been involved with them my whole le, so that would be huge.ldquoI feel like Irsquom pretty good in a team and having tasted a little success in team sports, I think thatI can get my game to that level, Irsquod be a good asset in that sense..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Ballynahinch.jpg","title":"Ballynahinch singer performs at nursing homes  ","story":"A BALLYNAHINCH man is serenading residents in local nursing and residential homes through the COVID- crisis with hit songs to remind them of happier times.The gesture from popular singer Wayne Rodgers is even more laudable as he lost all his work overnight in the lockdown as a driving instructor and a wedding band performer.The  year-old performed outside four homes on Monday, delighting the residents and carers in Redburn Nursing Home, Oakridge Care Home, Spa Nursing Home and Fishbourne House Care Home.Performing classic hits from artists such as Jim Reeves and Clf Richards, Wayne believes his singing is helping strike a chord with the elderly residents who need to be kept apart from family members at this time.ldquoThe singing helps the residents and it really helps me too as it passes the time for me as my work has had to stop due to the virus, said Wayne, who now lives in Bellaghy.ldquoIrsquove received photographs taken from the inside of the home showing residents enjoying my songs and itrsquos lovely to see. It can get really emotional as there are now family members turning up to wave and talk to their relatives through windows while I sing.ldquoItrsquos heartfelt to see their enjoyment at being able to connect with their parents or grandparents inside. It can be heart-breaking at times but itrsquos still nice to see it.ldquoI have been told by some of the carers that they have seen some patients with dementia sing along to the music and thatrsquos also really good to know.A former soloist with St Patrickrsquos Church in Ballynahinch and ex-pupil of St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College, Wayne ensures he keeps the residents and carers safe at all times.A long extension power lead from the home is laid for him before he arrives so he can plug in his mixing desk, microphone and laptop.Wayne said: ldquoItrsquos sterilised before I get it and when I had it back itrsquos sterilised again so I have no direct contact with anyone in the home.ldquoI try not to sing beyond  minutes as the homes often open the windows to allow residents to hear better and Irsquom conscious of not wanting anyone to get too cold in the process.Wayne started off singing at a Magherafelt nursing home when a pub owner hersquos friendly with was approached by the home asking for suggestions at how they could entertain the residents.He added: ldquoThe residents in the home loved it and asked me to come back again so I did and then I got calls from other homes.He now has nine performances under his belt with the help of his brother-in-law, former Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin, and his sister, Michelle, who runs Paddy Kellyrsquos Bar in Ballynahinch.Wayne, whose parents Maurice and Naveen still live in Ballynahinch, has been a show band singer for years and once performed with the legendary Sunshine.Gigs for his wedding band, The All Stars, have been cancelled or postponed as couples were force to rebook their wedding dates.Wayne is performing free of charge and says he is happy to as it gives him some focus in his le at this time.ldquoI donrsquot have much  to do as work has stopped, but I do feel a lot better knowing that Irsquom bringing some happiness to others, he added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Binmen.jpg","title":"Binmen receiving thank you messages for essential work  ","story":"THE districtrsquos binmen have been thanked for continuing to provide collection services during the coronavirus pandemic.Some people have been pasting messages on their bins thanking the men for the job they are doing, while their efforts have also been commended by Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Charlie Casey.Working in extremely dficult circumstances, the binmen are providing a critical service at this time and their efforts have not gone unnoticed by ratepayers who taking time to wipe the handles of their bins with disinfectant before they are collected to help keep refuse staff safe.Householders are also being reminded to ensure that they continue to place the correct waste in the right bin to help ease the burden on public health services to help stop additional risks to staff who are working under increasing pressure.Refuse collection staff have been singled out for particular praise as they collect and transport waste, with their work also helping to protect the environment.Stormont environment minister Edwin Poots said the materials refuse staff collect for processing such as cardboard, plastic and glass are vital resources in package production across the food and retail sectors, explaining that ain recycling could impact on the supply chain ing effectively.He added: ldquoAll those working in the waste sector are key workers and I have also established a COVID- Waste Group to provide support, guidance and regulatory direction to the waste sector.Newry, Mourne and Down Council mdash which recently closed all its household recycling centres to redeploy staff to work in refuse collection mdash said that all bin collections continue as normal.However, residents are asked to provide additional help by ensuring that bins are put out for collection no later than am every morning or the night before.Where possible, residents are asked not to restrict bin lorry access and park as considerately as possible. Over recent weeks, binmen have experienced issues accessing homes in a number of areas including Ballynahinch and Newcastle to collect bins.Residents are also asked to ensure that all bin handles are cleaned or wiped-down before and after use and not to approach refuse staff without following the minimum two-metre social distancing guidance.Commending refuse staff for the work they are doing in dficult circumstances, the council chairman explained that as the coronavirus crisis unfolded, the local authority was quick to implement a number of health and safety measures to protect staff.He explained that the measures allowed bin collection teams to continue the service with minimal disruptions to residents.ldquoCrews now operate staggered start times between .am and am and are authorised to leave work immediately upon the completion of their rounds, said Cllr Casey.ldquoTo support social distancing, crews are restricted to one driver and one loader in each cab. For crews that operate as one driver and two loaders, the loaders are transported behind the collection lorry in a support vehicle.ldquoLoaders are also asked to limit their time in cabs to an absolute minimum and can be collected and drop-off points along designated routes.Cllr Casey said the local authority is constantly reviewing its services in light of ldquorapidly changing events and may make further changes at very short notice.He said the current situation remains challenging and is dependent on the ongoing impact of COVID- on council employees.The chairman continued: ldquoWe would like to thank all our frontline workers who continue to engage with our residents to deliver essential services.ldquoI fully appreciate the disruption this has had on normal working routines. However, as a workforce and a wider-society we are now having to make signicant changes to our daily lives. I would also like to thank the public for their support and patience during very dficult circumstances.:Cllr Casey added: ldquoWith our household recycling centres now closed to free up resources needed to maintain domestic refuse collection services and help ensure compliance with social distancing guidance, we are appealing to people not to fly-tip and to do their bit to keep the district clean and safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 County.jpg","title":"Down Leisure Centre to be community hub  ","story":"DOWN Leisure Centre has been transformed into a new community co-ordination hub to ensure that vulnerable residents across the district receive essential supplies.Set up by Newry, Mourne and Down Council, the Downpatrick hub is one of three that have been established across the local authority areas.Others have opened in Kilkeel and Newry but the distribution centres are not open to members of the public or community groups.Local council officials have been working in partnership with their colleagues across local government, health trusts and the Department for Communities to set up the hub which is to play a key role in delivering the service on the ground.Down Leisure Centre mdash which has been closed to the public for the past month as a result of global pandemic mdash has been transformed into a processing centre to organise deliveries, with other sites currently being identied should they be required.When fully operational, over  leisure centre staff will be redeployed to work across all sites and work alongside others from across the organisation to help operate a lsquovirtualrsquo hub to coordinate the response.Staff training is currently underway for those who will be working in split shts at the centres while observing social distancing and other safety protocols.The service was formally launched on Monday across the councilrsquos seven even district electoral areas, with deliveries expected to centre on food supplies.In addition, a COVID- community helpline is already operational, with those in vulnerable groups seeking support can make contact between am and pm, seven days a week.The Freephone number is   , while the email is covid@adviceni.net.

It is certainly a strange experience for me.I was ordained in  in Downpatrick. New technologies and new means of communication came after that, and Irsquove struggled ever since. So the recent experience of having to install web-cams at short notice into the three churches in my two parishes of Portaferry and Ballygalget, has been somewhat traumatic.This week is the holiest of weeks for Christians. The passion and death of Jesus is commemorated, in preparation for the resurrection on Easter Sunday. We celebrate this in ious ways. We might well ask ourselves what happened to Lent and how on earth do we celebrate what will seem like a lsquovirtualrsquo Easter Coronavirus suddenly intruded into our Lent, at close quarters, and changed everything.My mother still remembers the glow in the sky over Belfast, when from her home in Ballykinlar, she heard the planes over South Down on their way to blitz Belfast. No doubt her grandmother would have told stories of the terrible pandemic of Spanish Influenza just over a century ago.But my generation and that of my nieces and nephews have known little of such things and we experience this pandemic a grave threat.At the moment of writing, the streets of Portaferry and Downpatrick are entirely empty, as are the great cities of Rome, London and New York.The unexpected severity of lockdown leaves us feeling bewildered, disorientated, shell-shocked. We are acutely aware of the suffering around us mdash illness, hospitalisation, loneliness in sudden isolation. As schools close we are anxious about increased tension in family le. The loss of our work and leisure patterns, financial and employment worries.In the Old Testament Jobloses so much of what he had mdash health, family, possessions and friends mdash yet he refuses to rebel against God in his suffering. This is incredibly dficult for most of us. His attitude of acceptance of his suffering can be of help to us. He says: ldquoShall we receive the good at the hand of God, and not take the bad Jobrsquos story can be useful to us at present. If you can get a chance, read it.Lent mdash an old English word for spring mdash is more challenging this year than we ever expected. As we celebrate Holy Week here are two words that figure in the writings of Henri Nouwen, a Dutch spiritual writer, that I find useful.The first word is security. Where do we look in our lives for security. A basic human need  In success, popularity, money, friends, family, insurance and so on  We mightnrsquot think we do. We will always be influenced by them, but deep down they will never provide us with security.Many of those things are good in themselves, but spiritually, the only true security will be found in the everlasting love of the One who loved us first and who wishes to love us into and for all eternity. Job understood that mdash security.The second word is patience. Patience means a kind of ldquosuffering through the present. Itrsquos from the Latin, patior, which means to suffer. But being patient does not mean sitting back and doing nothing. It is not being passive. Having patience is not easy for us. How do we wait patiently for God this Holy Week, Easter and beyond during this world pandemic Being patient is an active waiting mdash it means a certain experience of suffering through the present moment. To let the seeds of our suffering be sown in the ground so as to grow later into healthy, strong plants.It means avoiding the dead-end of what could have been for the ability to pay attention to what is happening before our very eyes, paying attention to the people and world around us. By that patience, we can begin to catch a glimpse of the first rays of Godrsquos glorious coming.Last week, I personally saw those first rays when I witnessed the staff in a residential nursing home in Portaferry decide to live-in with the residents for as long as this emergency would last.This week I witnessed those first rays when a cousin, a retired doctor, rang me to tell me he was volunteering toto work to bolster the Health Service.In one way or another have we not all been privileged to witness the generosity of spirit, despite danger, of those carers, nurses, doctors, medics, ancillary staff and many others Might this not be for us another glimpse that helps us experience in our present circumstances that Christ is indeed risen and lives now among us  It certainly is a glimpse for me.The Old Testament reading for many of us on Sunday last was from Ezekiel. ldquoThe Lord says this: I am going to open your graves. I mean to raise you from your graves and lead you back to the soil of Israel. I shall put my spirit in you, and you will live, and will know that I, the Lord, have said and done this it is the Lord who speaks.The people of Ezekielrsquos time knew their frailty and experienced uncertainty as we do today. Their faith in God had been severely shaken. Could they start again Security, patience, maybe these two words might stay with us over the next while as the reason for the hope that we have I leave you with the words of a psalm, which St Patrick himself echoed in his own writings, his lsquoConfessionrsquo.The words encourage us to place our hope in the Son of God who will sustain and strengthen us in our days, the Son of God, Jesus, who knew what it was like to stumble and fall beneath the weight of the Cross. With these words I ask God to bless us and keep us safe:ldquoI waited, I waited for the Lord and He stooped down to me, He heard my cry. He drew me from the deadly pit, from the miry clay. He set my foot upon a rock, and made my footsteps firm.With security and patience we can put our trust in the fallen saviour..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Huge.jpg","title":"Huge boost for foodbanks  ","story":"THE districtrsquos foodbanks have been provided with a pound, boost by Newry, Mourne and Down Council to help them respond to increasing need during the coronavirus pandemic.The funding has been provided via the local authorityrsquos community network and is one of a series of initiatives the local authority is spearheading to continue providing a range of frontline services and responding to the needs of the vulnerable and elderly in particular.This week, residents across the district have been thanked for adhering to advice to help stop the spread of coronavirus by staying indoors and keeping safe.And, as the Easter weekend approaches, council chief executive Marie Ward has appealed to people to continue to listen to the advice to stay at home and save lives.

","story":"AMBITIOUS plans to redevelop Ardglass harbour could cost in the region of poundm, a new report has revealed.The figure is contained in a detailed consultants report commissioned to undertake an in-depth feasibility study to look at potential developments for the harbour which is home to Northern Irelandrsquos third largest fishing fleet.The key issue the consultants focused on was deepening the harbour to facilitate larger vessels, with work also undertaken to look at improving harbour conditions, berthing pontoons for smaller vessels and increased berthing facilities.In addition, the study included a comprehensive review of possible harbour layouts, historic document research, topographic and bathymetric harbour surveys, quay wall inspection above and below the waterline and computermodelling.The consultants also liaised with the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairswhich has been given a copy of the consultants report ahead of further discussions with its officials on the way forward.Ardglass has the only all-weather harbour between Howth and Bangor and has three primary areas including the so-called fish dock within the south pier.There is also the Phennick Cove marina located behind a breakwater mdash which could be extended mdash to the west of the main harbour which can accommodate up to  leisure craft and the inner harbour which dries out at low tide.The consultants say that the inner harbour is particularly useful for vessel maintenance but not utilised as extensively as the outer harbour due to limited water depth.Last August, ious concept layouts produced by consultants were reviewed by members of the Ardglass Harbour Developments group which has been set up to oversee the regeneration of the port. The concepts were subsequently amended in November.The prime focus is on deepening the harbour and moving forward, a cost effective approach may be to zone dredge levels in particular areas.The report suggests deepening the outer harbour by nine metres and the area adjacent to Cochranersquos building at the inner harbour by two metres to facilitate crab vessels.In addition, consideration is being given to creating a pontoon with so-called finger berths adjacent to the quay wall in front of Cochranersquos with gangway access for crab vessels. No leisure craft would be permitted at this part of the harbour.Removal of the existing slipway at the southern end of the harbour adjacent to the beach is suggested as it is not generally used and considered too deep for access, with potential issues in relation to the removal of an area know as Church Rock to be investigated.Quay reclamation work is suggested between the north west corner of the existing finger pier at the ice plant and north western tip of the fish market quay.This would feature a new piled quay, backfilled and surfaced with a heavy duty concrete. Extending theof the quay wall by  metres is also suggested.The estimated cost of the harbour dredging is in the region of pound, with piling work and the new quay line and reclamation work estimated at poundm and poundm respectively.The breakwater extension is estimated at pound.m with the new pontoon facility estimated at pound,.The consultantsrsquo report makes it clear that the costings include primary construction elements but does not include licensing fees, site investigation, engineering design and tendering costs.Before anything happens, a marine licence is required for specic site investigation work, rock quality design and testing, sediment sampling of overburden, contamination testing and an environmental impact assessment.The regeneration jigsaw also requires detailed design work and planning approval ahead of tendering and construction.An economic appraisal may also be required.News of the proposed investment at Ardglass harbour comes after the portrsquos importance to the Ardglass fishing industry to the district and wider South Down economy was highlighted during a recent meeting with Stormont fisheries minister Edwin Poots.He met with South Down MLA Colin McGrath and local councillor Dermot Curran to discuss planned improvement work at the harbour, with the politicians also highlighting the need for additional investment in the harbour and its infrastructure.They described Ardglass harbour as ldquostrategically important for the Co Down fishing fleet, highlighting its crucial role in driving the South Down economy and its location as a central hub for processing fish landed at the port.Mr McGrath and Cllr Curran say further investment is ldquocritical to allow Ardglass harbour to expand to provide an economic boost, not only for the village but the wider area, and create new jobs..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/8th April 2020 Mourning.jpg","title":"Please stay in  ","story":"ldquoHE was my superman ndash the moving words from Loughinisland woman Maria Farrell whose father sadly lost his battle with COVID-.As her sister also lies in hospital fighting the virus, the mother-of-two has bravely spoken out to warn others not to be complacent about the deadly disease.Maria, who buried her father on Sunday, warned: ldquoIf you think you are exempt from this or you are immune to COVID-, you are barking up the wrong tree.ldquoMy dad went really quickly, hersquos tackled prostate cancer, heart attacks, falls, you name ithellip and hersquos bounced back.

I have been transported to a time that has changed my perception of le forever.People with CF have a faulty gene which means the mucus in their bodies is much thicker and stickier than in other people.They donrsquot catch viruses more easily than other people but when they do, it affects their lungs by causing inflammation and increasing the amount of the sticky mucus. This makes bacterial chest infections more likely, some of which are resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in lungwhich is the leading cause of death in people with CF.As parents, for the first sixth months of Lorcaacutenrsquos le we were consumed with the fear. We were advised not to visit baby groups, not to let people with colds into the house, not to take him to the supermarket on a weekend when it was busy, not to let him play in soil, wet sand, or day-old playdough as well as taking many, many more precautions to keep him safe.We also discovered that my mother-in-lawrsquos COPD and my fatherrsquos bronchiectasis meant that Lorcaacuten would always have to be careful around his beloved Nana and Grandad in case he caught an infection from them. For the same reason, he could never be within six feet of someone  with CF because of the risk of cross infection. My world would never mdash could never mdash be the same.We rarely left the house. I gave up my job in the RSPB and postponed my studies. Much of our time was taken up with the heavy burden of treatment for CF, including daily physiotherapy and antibiotics. I spent a lot of time campaigning for a cystic fibrosis drug, Orkambi, to be made available on the NHS.And I cried a lot.Over the last three years, le has become more lsquonormalrsquo but beneath the joy of every milestone has been the fear of taking risks that could shorten Lorcaacutenrsquos le at any time.During this time we have learnt that there are some risks you need to take in order to be happy. Lorcaacuten began pre-school as well as swimming, gymnastics, and football classes and I resumed my studies and began working a few hours a week.There has been a lot of stress and sleepless nights, a lot of handwashing, and a lot of happiness. With the support of the public we won the campaign for Orkambi, a drug which can slow the decline in lungby up to % and can be taken by around half of people with CF. Lorcaacuten started taking it at the end of last December mdash the champagne was popped and finally we thought we could start to relax a little.Sadly it wasnrsquot for long. During the wait for Orkambi, Lorcaacutenrsquos lungs had become damaged, after catching a couple of colds in March, he ended up in the wonderful Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children for  days of IV antibiotics to treat a long standing chest infection.During those  days I watched the horrying news that COVID- was spreading. I grew ever more disturbed at the lack of action by the UK Government. How could our amazing health service, stripped bare by  years of austerity and cuts, possibly hold up under the strain of COVID- Lorcaacuten was moved to a room further away from other patients, masks appeared and I watched the eyes of the incredible staff in the hospital become more and more tense.With nearly every death I read that the patient was either elderly or had an underlying health condition. But why did that make it OK: Surely that made it worse  The message seemed to be that lsquoonlyrsquo the vulnerable were at risk but other peoplersquos lsquoonlyrsquo is my everything.As the days in hospital passed, I learned that the lung conditions of my son, mother-in-law, and father put them among the , in NI on the extremely vulnerable list. They would need to lsquoshieldrsquo for the next  weeks. Shielding means not leaving the house at all and having to rely on the government and the goodness of others to deliver medication and food to your door.When Lorcaacuten was able to leave the hospital, we arrived home mdash with great relief mdash to a lockdown. Once again, with no job to go to and my studies on hold, I am transported to those months of isolation three years ago.This time, however, it is dferent, because this time I have hope. For us, this too shall pass. We willto the normality so hard won in our lives. We, unlike so many others who will lose their lives, will have this as a memory to pass on. I let so much of Lorcaacutenrsquos infancy be marred by fear that I just canrsquot let it happen now. Every day I am thankful for my good fortune in a desperately unfair world. I am thankful for all the frontline workers and volunteers, for the Executive finally working together for the common good to sustain us and to protect the most vulnerable in society, for the kindness of people delivering food and medication to those most at risk.I am grateful to the other souls sitting in their homes feeling helpless and feeling like le is passing them by. But by feeling helpless we are helping more people have a le toto after this all ends.It will end but the world will never mdash can never mdash be the same and none of us will look at it in the same way either.Maybe it will be a world in which those who need support will begin to get it, a world in which our NHS will finally be built up rather than worn down, a world we protect rather than profit from. As I watch Lorcaacuten run happily and healthily around our safe home with his little sister, Saorla, I donrsquot feel fear for him. I feel fear for those putting their lives at risk for all of us, for those who will lose their lives and loved ones, and for those who are sitting in their homes feeling afraid.I often think that doing nothing is the hardest thing to do, but for the moment doing otherwise is a risk too great to take, for us all.

To help overcome this a new mobile telephone number is available mdash  .Good Morning Down was established to help reduce loneliness and isolation. Volunteers also signpost those who need further support to other agencies.Good Morningrsquos Down service has never been more important. One of the charityrsquos volunteers, Aidan Harris, says the current climate represents a challenge for everyone, particularly those who live alone.ldquoThe staff moved out of our base at the business park over two weeks ago, but we are providing the service from our own homes and what we are doing is very much appreciated by those we contact every week, he explained.ldquoWe certainly are living in unprecedented times none of us have ever experienced anything like this in our letimes and hopefully will never do again.Aidan explained that while a lot of information people need to hear is circulated via social media, many elderly people do not have access to it. In the main, he said they are relying on the television and radio.ldquoWe are letting them know what is happening and reinforcing the message to stay indoors and not let anyone into their home, even their own relatives. We are highlighting the importance of them doing all that they can not to catch the virus, the charity volunteer continued.ldquoPeople are very concerned at what is going on and many of those whom we contact used to get out to attend ious clubs but they have all closed due to the pandemic which means the elderly and vulnerable are spending even longer alone in their homes.Aidan also revealed that some who normally received only one call a week are now getting several more, with people brought off the waiting list so they can be contacted.He also revealed that the charity is also providing the people they contact with details about local shops which are providing a delivery service.ldquoWe are emphasising the hand hygiene message as much as we can and reminding people to stay indoors. We are also telling them to exercise social distancing and not let anyone into their homes, he said.ldquoWe are also telling those whom we contact not even to let one of their neighbours over the door as it is simply too risky. The people whom we contact are very concerned about what is going on but they are made of stern stuff.Aidan added: ldquoAll the volunteers are working hard to make sure we maintain contact with our clients, more regularly than in the past by increasing the number of calls we make to them.ldquoThe reward is how grateful they are for the service we provide and our main goal is do all we can to let them know that we are here for them and want them to keep safe..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11196852.jpg","title":"latest figures reveal island trend","story":"Latest statistics show that in the Fermanagh and Omagh District region the number of positive cases rose to  with a total of  positive cases across Northern Ireland.Health Minister, Robin Swann explained that there is likely to be a second surge of the virus later in the year: ldquoEven then, a reasonable worst case scenario would involve signicant loss of le in Northern Ireland.

Performance of the Oberammergau Passion Play : Freelance“The nd Oberammergau Passion Play will be postponed due to the current situation caused by the corona pandemic.”In the Baian district of Germany, beside the Ammer River and framed by the Ammergau Alps, Oberammergau is a small town known for its woodcarvings, its NATO School and its internationally renowned -yearly Passion Play.The organisers of the Passion Play summarised the historical signicance of the postponement, explaining that the event “goes back to a vow made in . At that time, the people of Oberammergau vowed to perform the suffering, death and resurrection of Christ,no one died of the plague anymore.Engraving depicting the Passion Play in  : Freelance \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Therefore the plans to perform the Passion Play in  are currently beginning.”Held in the ‘decimal year’I attended a performance in , one of the most vivid and moving experiences of my letime, and indeed, I had toyed with the thought of ing this year.There would have been  performancesstarting in mid-May with an expected , visitors from around the globe paying between € to € for a ticket.The enormous production has been running since  except for two cancellations and a postponement.Crucixion scene in the Passion Play in  : FreelanceNearly half of the , residents of today’s Oberammergau are involved with the show - actors, musicians, front of house, backstage and looking after the horses, sheep, goats, cows and doves that add to the often intensely dramatic scenes.The other half of the townsfolk run the restaurants, shops, hotels, BBs and farmsteads where many of the visitors stay,they’re lucky.The nearest accommodation I could get in  was St. Anton am Arlberg in the Austrian Tirol.Participants in the production must have been born in Oberammergau or have lived there for  years.Oberammergau on the River Ammer in  : FreelanceIt’s not unusual for up to four generations of the same family to be taking part in the same run of plays, which can involve around  children on stage at the same time.In the th century, passion plays were held in many parts of Europe, often performed on carts in the street.They re-enacted Christ’s last days, from his entry into Jerusalem to his trial, crucixion, resurrection and ascension.In the bigger and more elaborate productions, when scene one ended the cart trundled off to another part of the town or city and scene two arrived, and so on!They were the ‘poor man’s Bible’ enabling even the most illiterate become familiar with Bible stories.But Oberammergau’s is the only play with its origins in a collective vow to God which has run, almost without a break, for approaching four centuries. This unique double-accolade brought the town a UNESCO World Heritage award.It’s quite likely that passion plays were already common events but a document in Oberammergau’s archives records “the first decades of the th century went by in peaceful calm…but then followed the Thirty Years’ War with all its hardships from  until . As early as , infectious diseases spread in Baia. This village was spared by dutul vigilance until the church festival in , when a man brought the plague into the village.”More than  local folk died and almost every family lost loved ones.“Faced with the great distress that the terrible illness inflicted upon the population,” the archive continues, “the leaders of the community came together and pledged to hold a passion tragedy once every ten years. From this day forward, not a single person perished, even though a great number of them still showed signs of the plague”.They made the pledge in  and the Passion Play was first performed at Pentecost in , on a wooden stage that some say was built on plague-victims’ graves near the church.Surviving documentation from the  production shows that the play ran ‘completed smoothly’ with seating provided ‘for spectators standing close by.’From  the date of the performance was changed to the beginning of each decade, by which time folk were coming from all over Germany to see substantial productions.Paint and painters for the  show’s scenery cost  guilders, ‘the gentlemen trumpeters’ got two guilders and  guilders went ‘to the actors for drink’!There was no performance in  when Maximilian III’s Clerical Council banned all passion plays and when another threat loomed in the s the so-called ‘mad’ King Ludwig II of Baia protected it from those who wanted to close down the ‘harmful’ passion plays. Following WWI the play was postponed until , and there was a special th anniversary show in  attended by Adolf Hitler.There were no performances in  during WWII, just the second cancellation…until now.Plans to perform the Passion Play in  are already under way, for over  five-hour shows, several thousand participants, a -strong orchestra and a -strong choir.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Egypt had been ravished by pestilence and plagues galore and the country was devastated as a result. In the end the stubborn Pharaoh lets the people of Israel go. There are similarities with this classic story from the Bible and events today with the ‘plague’ of coronavirus and so many people having to stay in their homes till the danger has passed. We know in the end the final outcome was one of overcoming and redemption. We do hope for that too in the present situation which has come upon so many countries in almost ‘Biblical’ proportions.The Last Supper of Jesus which many Christians commemorate at this time of year was that same Passover meal that featured the unleavened bread and wine and the telling of God’s redemption from slavery through the shedding of the blood of the Passover lamb. The New Testament says, “Christ our ‘Passover’ was shed for us, therefore let us keep the Feast ” which the early Jewish Christians did to remember His death on this date. This was later changed to a day of the week rather than the actual date and so the two no longer link up, except for early Christians like St Patrick and other early pre-Roman churches. We can be mindful of these things this Passover, with both Jews and Christians in their homes while their places of worship remain closed. There is enough rich symbolism to satisfy both faiths. It may even bring some understanding between them as they both recall redemption and deliverance.Colin Nevin, Kosher chef, King Solomon Restaurant, Hilton Tel-Aviv, Israel -"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus we are keeping london loop insists ni ministry amid claims solo run buy ppe gear ","story":"Coronavirus: Police preparing prosecution file over crowds at republican’s burial processionQuestions asked about ‘social distancing’ after crowds attend funeral of republican Francie McNallyNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensCoronavirusNewsPoliticsCoronavirus: ‘We are keeping London in the loop’ insists NI ministry amid claims of a solo run to buy PPE gearThe Department of Health says it has kept the London government abreast of a planned personal protective equipmentorder from China, following a report that the Province is ignoring centralised UK-wide buying arrangements.By Adam KulaFriday, th April , : pm\"\"Medical staff put on their PPE on Tuesday at an MOT testing centre in Belfast which is being used as a drive through testing location for Covid- : PA Wire PA ImagesIt was reacting to a story broken by the Nolan Show today, that a £m deal for PPE is now in the pipeline for Northern Ireland – but that it could be coming direct from China not via a UK-wide deal.It comes after over five million pieces of PPEwere shipped into the Province from Liverpool last week as part of an arrangement with the London government.It also comes a week after a joint north-south Irish deal for PPE –which had been touted by Sinn Fein finance minister Conor Murphy – flopped spectacularly a week ago, resulting in nothing being sent to Northern Ireland.The Nolan Show referred to documentation which it said its journalists had obtained about the new deal – which the BBC said could happen on Tuesday, April , and would involve scores of millions of items of PPE. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

But we have to get that which is reliable. You just don’t buy, buy, buy for the sake of having got somethingit’s not suitable.“I think there are genuine, real concerns as to why we put so much effort and money into those sources, when it seems we have a reliable four-nations source.”The Department of Health said: “The Department has ensured that the Department of Health and Social Care in London is apprised of the proposed supply route. These communications are ongoing.“Prospective PPE supply routes from China for Northern Ireland have not been finalised. It would be a matter of great regretany potential arrangements were jeopardised by partial and malicious leaking.”The department was asked how the Nolan Show’s story could “jeopardise” any such purchase, but it did not respond by time of writing.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...The Presbyterian Moderator recently began a series of Sunday worship services that are being made available on the church’s website.“My own church had been live streaming our service for some time anyway, but I wanted to do something for the denomination as a whole — particularly those parishes which do not have the technology themselves,” he said. “Principally the reason is to give a little bit of normality in the midst of all the chaos. All the normal elements you would find in a Presbyterian service are there. It takes a bit of the pressure off the local ministers, hopefully”He continued: “When you see the numbers of people who are watching it, there’s never been more. I’ve been surprised. I did a little tiny clip on Facebook and there were , hits in a very small time.“And you’re getting people on the far side of the world watching as well.“I simply go into the building and record all the spoken bits — the prayers, the reading, and a kids’ talks.“ I choose my songs but I’m using the material going back to or three years, which has already been recorded. But it’s video. So you can pan back and see the congregation so there’s a connection that this is what we used to do.”But the clergyman admits it is a “bizarre” experience preaching to an empty church building.He explained: “When you’re in a building that normally seats  and there’s nobody  in there except for the cameraman, it is a completely bizarre experience. “You miss the interaction with people. A preacher interacts with his people. “It lacks a bit of that but you try to make it as normal as possible.”But while everyone will be hoping the coronavirus crisis passes sooner rather than later, Rev Henry believes the streaming technology has shown its merits.“I would imagine that any congregation who has dipped their toe in with all of this will want to develop itbecause they will see the reach that it has.”He continued: “They will want to develop their journey with that. “You have people working away from home, even people on holidays and students are still connecting with their home Church.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-bEjcJn boXdXt\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-fOICqy kfiVLF\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-bYSBpT sc-elJkPf kHpvMx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

for instance, how do you go about still getting your chemoyou have cancer whilst also social-distancing \"If you have cancer its particularly important to stay away from other people, but you also of course have got to keep going with your chemotherapy.\"He added: \"These are some of the most dficult and challenging cases so well be getting in contact with them, butpeople think that they are on this list and dont receive a communication from the NHS, then they also need to get in contact.\"So that is under way, the money was announced for it yesterday.\"A combination of money to the NHS and money to councils because theyve got a very big part to play in keeping people safe.\"ASCL general secretary Geoff Barton said schools will have first worked to identy vulnerable children, as they will know who they are, and will then be looking at the \"key worker\" category.He said the ASCL is telling members: \"You have to do your best to negotiate the key workers list. Youre doing this to a tight timescale, and what you offer children on Monday may be dferent to what you offer next Wednesday.\"Mr Barton said that initially, schools will be doing all they can so that pupils who need to can still turn up to their own school after the weekend.In the longer term, there will be more strategic planning of school provision, he added.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: \"The Government has made clear that every child who can be safely cared for at home should be. And their advice makes clear too that this applies to children of key workers.\"For the vast majority of children and young people, school buildings will close tonight and not reopen for the foreseeable future.\"Taking up a place at school during this time of wider closure is the offer of last resort, for the minority of key workers, who have no alternative.\"School leaders have many questions that remain unanswered about how this will work in practice.

Irsquove grown up on the beach.ldquoI normally take landscape pictures because I love the water and some of the sunsets here are incredible, especially in the winter.Rochelle wrote her Instagram handle on the parcels, so that people who found them could send her a message.ldquoIt was just to make someone smile, and Irsquove had some lovely comments from people who got back to me on Instagram, she said.ldquoThey said they were going to put it up in their room and frame it.ldquoSome people were feeling a bit down and didnrsquot expect to find anything, so it cheered them up.ldquoMy job was done ndash the main purpose was to make people smile and it did - it made me smile too.ldquoI think itrsquos very important to say hello, especiallypeople are living by themselves orthey havenrsquot got their family around.ldquoWhen Irsquom normally walking the dog I say hello and have a chat, but itrsquos quite hard to do that now because everyone is quite wary.ldquoI donrsquot have to have that physical contact with someone to brighten up their day.ldquoArt is just a dferent  to communicate with. You knowsomeonersquos a bit shy and they donrsquot want to speak using words, they may want to draw a picture and open up that way instead.ldquoI think art can show feelings that words canrsquot quite express, so itrsquos a great idea to share that with the community.At a time of uncertainty and doubt, Rochelle ended with a message of hope and solidarity:ldquoI think as a community we could do so much more at this time, she saidldquoEveryone is concerned about how long it is going to last, but I am hopeful we can get past it, andwe all work together and remain positive we may come out of this in an even better situation than we was before.Rochelle would like to make clear that all parcels were fully sanitised.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Deaths in care homes and where are not recorded in those figures so the real number of dead toll is likely to be considerably higher.Downing Street said that Mr Johnson was in ldquoextremely good spirits and would be receiving close monitoring during ldquothe early phase of his recovery.With fine weather forecast for many parts of the country over the long bank holiday weekend, minister fear people may flout the rules and flock to beaches and beauty spots.NHS Englandrsquos national medical director Stephen Powis said it was ldquocritical that people obeyed the instructions and stayed at home.ldquoWe are beginning to see the benefits of this social distancing. We do believe the virus is spreading less he said.ldquoThat will only continue to happenwe donrsquot get complacent and continue to follow those instructions.The warning came as the latest official figures showed the number of hospital patients in the UK who had died after testing positive for Covid- had risen to , as of pm on Wednesday ndash an increase of  on the previous day.The Government is due to carry out the first three-week review of the lockdown measures next week.Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is deputising for Mr Johnson, has said the Governmentrsquos Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieswould be studying the evidence but they would not be to say more until the end of the week. vw,vw,px, px\"Dominic Raab has said scientists will study the evidence on whether the lockdown is working Professor Paul Cosford, emeritus medical director for Public Health England , said the while there were signs the spread of the disease was slowing, it was likely the restrictions would still be needed for several weeks.ldquoIt really does look like the numbers are flattening. That is really important because that is the first sign that we may be getting to the peak of this pandemic, he told the BBC Radio  Today programme.ldquoI think several weeks isnrsquot unreasonable.
