Takeshi Minami, chief economist at Norinchukin Research Institute, suggests the global semiconductor shortages hit demand: A private index measuring activity at factories in China fell to 49.1 in January from December’s 50.9, the weakest since February 2020 in the first wave of the pandemic. That shows that the sector shrank this month, a gloomier view than the official PMI (see earlier post). The CaixinMarkit manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index found that companies saw drop in output and new orders during January, at a modest pace. New export business fell at the quickest pace since May 2020, and supply chain delays worsened. Firms also reported that inflationary pressures increased, with average input costs rising, and their own prices increasing. Dr. Wang Zhe, Senior Economist at Caixin Insight Group, says the ongoing pandemic hit China’s factory base:  China’s factories have slowed this month, as the latest wave of Covid-19 infections hits its economy. The official manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) dropped to 50.1 this month, showing a slowdown from December’s 50.3, data released this weekend shows. That’s only just above the 50-point mark showing stagnation.  It suggests the Covid-19 outbreaks and lockdowns in several Chinese provinces in recent months have disrupted factories and hit demand, ahead of the Lunar New Year. A subindex for production in January fell to 50.9, down from 51.4 in December, while a subindex for new orders came in at 49.3, down from 49.7 in December, showing orders fell at a faster rate. New export orders rose to 48.4 compared with 48.1 a month earlier, suggesting overseas demand remained subdued. China’s services sector also showed slower growth, pulling the wider composite PMI down to 51.0, from 52.2 Ryanair has kept expanding, ready to win market share as travel returns. Since April 2021 it has announced 15 new bases and 720 new routes.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the world economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business. Budget airline Ryanair has struck a cautious note over the speed of the recovery in the travel sector this morning, after posting a net loss of €96m for the last three months. With Omicron hitting operations in recent weeks, Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary has warned that the outlook in the current quarter (its Q4) is “hugely uncertain”, despite a recent pick-up in demand. Demand has improved recently after travel restrictions were lifted, O’Leary says. But bookings are coming in later than usual, so the airline is planning price cuts this quarter to stimulate demand. Ryanair cut its capacity for January by a third in response to the latest variant which caused a “collapse in bookings” over the ChristmasNew Year period. In December, traffic fell to 9.5m passengers, below its target of 11m. O’Leary warns that the outlook for this quarter (January-March) is very uncertain, saying: Ryanair is sticking to its target of carrying ‘just under’ 100m passengers this financial year. But due to Covid uncertainty its earnings guidance is wider than usual - with a net loss of between €250m and €450m expected. O’Leary adds there could be further Covid disruption ahead: "},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education.Languages, health and engineering among areas likely to be needed by 2026Many arts graduates now entering marketing, advertising, journalism, technology and lawInstead of taking the traditional route, Denisa Zima chose an accounting apprenticeshipSubject area profiles: Law and Business"},{"url":null,"title":"q a what are the new guidelines around the phased return to the workplace","story":"Handwashing, being extra careful when you cough or sneeze, getting rid of used tissues safely and making sure your workplace is adequately ventilated, are all still advised. Photograph: iStockAs of January 24th, the requirement to work from home unless you need to attend your workplace came to an end, which means a phased return to the workplace is underway for thousands of organisations and their employees.The “great return” is proceeding against a backdrop where some of the basic public health measures have been removed, including the requirement that people indoors be two metres apart and wear masks, although masks remain obligatory in certain specified settings.The Government on Monday published a “transitional protocol” to provide guidance as the return to the workplace gathers apace.Can I return to my old desk in my office and resume working exactly the way I used to up to March 2020?No. Although a lot of the restrictive measures introduced for public health reasons have been eased, the overarching message is that workplaces and workers need to continue to take steps to limit the circulation of the virus.So handwashing, being extra careful when you cough or sneeze, getting rid of used tissues safely and making sure your workplace is adequately ventilated, are all still advised.Crucially, any worker who develops Covid-19 symptoms should stay away from work, as should anyone who has tested positive for the virus. This applies to everyone, irrespective of whether they are fully vaccinated or not.What does that mean for employers?It means that they have to continue to take steps to help ensure that the spread of the virus is contained. Among the measures mentioned in the protocol are the displaying of signs that advise on best practice in relation to Covid-19, ensuring that the facilities are available for good hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene practices, and continuing to provide hand sanitisers at entry and exit points.Employers are also being advised to keep in place some of the structures they may have already established, such as having a designated “leader worker representative” and Covid response management team in place to deal with the implementation of the organisation’s Covid measures and dealing with potential outbreaks.What about desks?It is no longer required that people be two metres apart or that there be pods of six people in indoor gatherings, but the health advice is that adopting physical distance measures is still good practice.So employers, and employees, are being advised to keep this in mind when returning to desk work in open-plan offices, and likewise when attending meetings or training sessions.Ventilation, good hand and respiratory hygiene, and regular cleaning of worktops, are all still highly advisable and valuable. Workplaces with hot desks should have adequate cleaning materials on hand for before and after use by each employee.What about masks?Everyone is still required to wear a mask on public transport, in healthcare settings, taxis, public offices and shops, as well as when working with food or in places that serve food and drink. In other settings, they are no longer required.But the public health advice is that it is still good practice to continue to wear face masks in other indoor settings too, particularly in crowded ones, so workers and employers might still consider it a good idea to promote face covering in the workplace.Employers should continue to support those workers who want to continue using face coverings, the protocol states. Also special measures should be put in place for people who are high risk or especially vulnerable. A fitness to work medical risk assessment may be required in some instances, and these may lead to some workers being advised to wear surgical or FFP2 masks.What should happen if a worker develops symptoms while at work?Persons who develop symptoms should be quickly isolated from their colleagues and workplaces should identify a designated isolation area, the route to which should be easily accessible. Medical grade masks should be available for those who develop symptoms while in the workplace, and plans put in place for how such persons are to be managed.Do organisations still have to keep a log of everyone who enters a workplace?According to the protocol, the need to maintain a contact log with details of workers and visitors to a workplace has been removed. But it also says employers may need to provide attendance information in the event of the public health authorities having to investigate an outbreak.

Photograph: ChesnotGetty ImagesSpotify is adding a message that will direct listeners to correct Covid-19 information as controversy over misinformation shared on comedian Joe Rogan’s podcast continues to grow, with the streamer losing billions in market value and more musicians withdrawing their music.On Sunday, the chief executive of Spotify, Daniel Ek, released an official statement setting out the streaming platform’s plan to tackle misinformation. New content advisories will direct listeners of any podcast that discusses coronavirus to a dedicated website that “provides easy access to data-driven facts, up-to-date information as shared by scientists, physicians, academics and public health authorities around the world, as well as links to trusted sources”.Spotify’s rules for its creators have also been made public for the first time, with users told they cannot publish “content that promotes dangerous, false or dangerous, deceptive medical information that may cause offline harm or poses a direct threat to public health”.Examples include calling Covid “a hoax or not real” or “encouraging people to purposely get infected with Covid-19 in order to build immunity to it”. Users who break the rule could see their content removed from the platform and repeat offenders could be suspended or banned.“You’ve had a lot of questions over the last few days about our platform policies and the lines we have drawn between what is acceptable and what is not. We have had rules in place for many years but admittedly, we haven’t been transparent around the policies that guide our content more broadly,” Mr Ek’s statement said.Mr Ek wrote that the content advisories will roll out “around the world in the coming days”.“To our knowledge, this content advisory is the first of its kind by a major podcast platform,” he added.Mr Rogan, host of The Joe Rogan Experience, has sparked controversy for repeatedly spreading misinformation about Covid on his show, including the conspiracy theory that hospitals are financially incentivised to record Covid as a cause of death. He has also promoted the use of ivermectin, an anti-parasitic treatment used mainly on animals, to treat Covid symptoms. It has not been proved to be effective at preventing or treating Covid.Last week, musician Neil Young asked his management to remove his music from Spotify, citing misinformation on Mr Rogan’s podcast: “I am doing this because Spotify is spreading false information about vaccines – potentially causing death to those who believe the disinformation being spread by them. They can have Rogan or Young. Not both.”After removing his music, Spotify said it regretted “Neil’s decision – but hope to welcome him back soon”. Their shares dropped 6 per cent over two days, then recovered slightly – before musician Joni Mitchell announced she would also remove her music from the platform.“Irresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives,” Ms Mitchell wrote. “I stand in solidarity with Neil Young and the global scientific and medical communities on this issue.”Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who signed a multi-year podcast partnership with Spotify for their company, Archewell Audio, said in a statement that they had expressed concerns about misinformation to Spotify last year.“We have continued to express our concerns to Spotify to ensure changes to its platform are made to help address this public health crisis. We look to Spotify to meet this moment and are committed to continuing our work together as it does,” a spokesperson for the couple said.As of Sunday, Spotify had lost more than $2 billion (€1.8 billion) in market value and removed more than 20,000 episodes of podcasts that were related to Covid-19, in accordance with its “detailed content policies”.Calls on social media for people to cancel their Spotify subscriptions have intensified over the last week. The company has not disclosed how many users have left, but a message from its customer support team to subscribers said they were “getting a lot of contacts so may be slow to respond”.Spotify acquired Mr Rogan’s show in 2020, in a deal worth more than $100 million (€90 million). The Joe Rogan Experience is now Spotify’s most popular podcast and one of the biggest in the world. – Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"government urges caution on return to workplaces in new guidelines","story":"The new guidelines issued today contain advice for both workers and employers after the emergency recommendation to work from home was lifted earlier this month. Photograph: Dominic LipinskiPA Wire The Government is urging employers to adopt a cautious approach to the return to workplaces, stressing a gradual process, consultation with worker representatives, permanent hybrid working arrangements where appropriate\u0026nbspand supports for employees nervous about the return to the office.New advice issued on Monday said\u0026nbspemployers may wish to keep some Covid rules in place for now.They are not obliged to retain contact details of all office visitors but employers may need to provide attendance information to health officials in the event of a Covid outbreak in the workplace, the protocol states.The new guidelines issued on Monday\u0026nbspby the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment contain\u0026nbspadvice for both workers and employers after the emergency recommendation to work from home was lifted earlier this month.“The pandemic is not over and the emergence of new variants with increased levels of transmissibility, immune escape andor virulence remains a risk both nationally and globally,” the document states.The protocol urges employers to maintain constant contact with unions and employee representatives as the return to the workplace is rolled out.“The requirements to maintain a two metre physical distance and to adopt pods of six for indoor events have been removed,” it states.“However, public health advice for the inidual and for sectors notes that adopting a physical distance continues to be good practice. Employers may choose to maintain some of the practices or arrangements that were in place based on the Work Safely Protocol for the period of transition back to office working. In meetings, events or training, the continued focus on hand and respiratory etiquette and adequate ventilation are all measures that may continue.”Covid controlsIt also says that maintaining some Covid controls “will also enable workplaces, employers and employees respond quickly should the public health advice change or should Covid-19 levels increase in the future”.It is advisable to continue to use face masks in many instances, the document continues. Even outside areas such as retail and public transports where masks are still required, it says, “it is still good practice to continue to use face maskscoverings particularly in crowded areas”.“Workers who use or share work vehicles may also consider using a face maskcovering. Iniduals at high or very high risk should also follow public health advice in relation to mask wearing, including wearing a surgical or FFP2 mask when in crowded indoor settings . . . Employers should continue to support and facilitate the use of face masks by workers who may wish to continue to use them.”It also says that the “rapid self-isolation” of anyone who develops symptoms, even if they are fully vaccinated and boosted, remains a “critical component” of the response to Covid.Employers should also pay special attention to people who are anxious about the return to the office, it says, adding “employers should consult and address concerns where appropriate”.The document also stresses that Government policy is to promote remote working where appropriate for employers and workers.The Labour Party says it plans to publish this week a Private Members’ Bill that would provide workers with “a right to flexible work”.The party’s spokesperson on workers’ rights, Senator Marie Sherlock, accused the Government of lacking ambition on promoting remote working.“It is staring an opportunity in the face to breathe new life into our towns and villages, while freeing up space in our cities so young workers are no longer forced out of the communities they grew up in,” she said.On Saturday, the number of people being treated for Covid-19 in Irish hospitals dropped to its lowest level so far this year, with 649 people then hospitalised for the virus.

A significant EU-wide rule change to come into force on Tuesday means that the digital Covid certs that have been used to facilitate much international travel since the middle of July last year now come with an expiry limit of nine months.That means anyone who received their second dose of the primary vaccine before the beginning of last May will require a booster jab if they are planning to travel using the digital Covid cert. While about 95 per cent of Irish adults have completed their primary vaccine course, the numbers of eligible adults who have received a booster jab is closer to 80 per cent.The percentage of people who have been boosted falls significantly among younger age groups, with between 40 and 70 per cent of people aged between 18 and 49 boosted.The vast majority of this cohort will not reach the nine-month cut-off point until the summer at the earliest and many of them are likely to be able to provide proof of having recovered from Covid-19 as an alternative to the booster jab. Vaccinated However, the issue could be more pressing for people who were fully vaccinated before May 1st last year. Just under half a million people received their primary vaccination before the start of last May and about 10 per cent of them have yet to receive a booster shot.People without a booster will still be able to travel if they have proof of recovery from Covid-19 or are willing to take a PCR test within a set window before they travel.The European Commission introduced the nine-month cut-off point to avoid erging measures across the EU and “takes into account the guidance of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control regarding the administration of booster doses as of six months, and provides for an additional period of three months to ensure that national vaccination campaigns can adjust and citizens can have access to boosters”. It has mandated that EU countries “should not accept such vaccination certificates if more than nine months have passed since the date of vaccination indicated” and stressed that “at this stage” it is not proposing a validity period for certificates issued based on booster shots. Paul Hackett, president of the Irish Travel Agents Association, said the change “has been pretty well flagged and I honestly think people booking travel are aware they need to check the regulations”. Vaccine approvedOn Saturday, a fifth Covid-19 vaccine was approved for use in the State by the National Immunisation Advisory Committee. Nuvaxovid, which has been developed by US company Novavax, can be used in those aged 18 and over. It is administered in two doses with a three-week interval.Meanwhile, it has emerged that a glitch in the computer systems at the Passport Office in recent days impacted the applications of some of those who tried to get new passports using its online portal. People who attempted to apply online were asked to upload all their details and pay the required fee before receiving an error message which said: “Your transaction has been successful but there was a problem connecting back to the merchant’s web site. Please contact your merchant and advise them that you received this message.”A spokeswoman for the Passport Office confirmed that it was experiencing “intermittent issues for a small number of users”.

It takes seconds to post on social media but the fallout can last much longer. It’s important to think before you post, particularly when a matter is the subject of court proceedings or a Garda investigation. Being fair and accurate is crucial. The potentially serious consequences for overstepping the legal lines include a fine, and even jail, for contempt of court or damages for defamation. Here’s a guide to help stay on the right side of the law when you’re online. What’s the legal position when a person is arrested in connection with a criminal offence?The matter is deemed to be sub judice, meaning it’s before a court or judge, and there are clear limits on what can and cannot be said. From the time an inidual is arrestedcharged, the facts are for a court to decide. An inidual arrested and questioned in connection with a criminal offence should not be identified prior to being charged.Why can’t more details be given?Because we operate in a democracy governed by the rule of law. An accused is entitled to the presumption of innocence unless and until proven guilty. Public discussion of the case, which can sometimes be ill-informed, could prejudice a jury whose role is to decide the facts.So what can I say? It’s best to say nothing when a matter is subject of criminal proceedings. There are good reasons for this, including that information circulated about an accused or crime is sometimes inaccurate and whipping up public opinion against accused people has contributed in the past to people being convicted of offences they didn’t commit. What happens if an arrestedcharged person is identified? It depends on what is said. Anyone who publishes negative material about someone who is arrested leaves themselves open to contempt of court andor defamation proceedings. When material about a charged person, or details of the offence with which they are charged, is published, the consequences can be serious. Apart from exposing its publisher to defamation and contempt proceedings, such publication has potential to derail or even collapse a jury trial.What does defamation mean?Defamation is the publication to at least one other person of comment, inaccurate statements, false reporting or other material capable of causing damage to the reputation of a person, business or other organisation. The Defamation Act 2009 defines a “defamatory statement” as one “that tends to injure a person’s reputation in the eyes of reasonable members of society”. Anyone suing for defamation has to show there was “publication, by any means” of defamatory material concerning them to one, or more than one, person. The Act applies to ALL publications and there is a rising number of cases alleging defamation and contempt of court over online content, including social media posts. A couple received €30,000 damages against their neighbour in county Donegal who had put up a Facebook post making allegations including of an affair. Surely I can say what I like to my friends and family in my WhatsApp groups?There’s a risk in saying what you like, even on WhatsApp, if the content is defamatory. Online defamation is the publication of defamatory statements in e-mails, web postings, Facebook posts, tweets and mobile phone group messaging such as WhatsApp groups. A retweet or simple forwarding of a message can be akin to acting as the original publisher, particularly if further comment is added.What about the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter? Can they be sued over what’s posted on their sites? E-commerce regulations mean intermediaries such as Google, Facebook and Twitter are excluded from liability under a “hosting defence” for material published on their systems where they are unaware of the defamatory, false or criminal content. If intermediaries are given notice of defamatory material, they are expected to take it down speedily if they want to benefit from the hosting defence and are not deemed to be a publisher. Orders may also be sought against internet service providers aimed at identifying posters of defamatory material. Anonymity online is not absolute due to protocols on device and internet addressing.

File photograph: John ThysAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union ombudsman accused the European Commission of maladministration on Friday for not disclosing text messages that the head of the EU executive, Ursula von der Leyen, exchanged with Pfizer chief Albert Bourla to seal a Covid-19 vaccine deal.In an interview in April, Ms Von der Leyen revealed she had exchanged texts with Mr Bourla for a month when they were negotiating a vaccine contract for the bloc. But in response to a public access request by a journalist, the commission later said no record had been kept of such messages.“The narrow way in which this public access request was treated meant that no attempt was made to identify if any text messages existed,” said ombudsman Emily O’Reilly.“The ombudsman found that this amounted to maladministration,” the watchdog said in a statement, asking the commission to check again for the relevant messages and to reply to the recommendation by April 26th.“If text messages concern EU policies and decisions, they should be treated as EU documents,” the ombudsman added.A spokesman for the commission later on Friday declined to comment about whether the texts had been cancelled and whether they were exchanged with a private or a professional telephone.He told journalists the EU executive would reply to the ombudsman by the deadline and noted EU rules required the commission to register documents, with no specific requirement to store text messages as long as they were not treated as documents.The ombudsman’s recommendations are not binding, but usually trigger heightened scrutiny from the European Parliament. “The European Commission has become less transparent, less accountable to the European Parliament and frankly more unhinged from European democracy,” said liberal Dutch MEP Sophia In ‘t Veld.The deal negotiated via text messages and calls, according to what Ms Von der Leyen herself said in an interview with the New York Times, was the biggest contract ever sealed for Covid-19 vaccines, with the EU committing to buy 900 million Pfizer-BioNTech shots, with an option to buy another 900 million.When the deal was formally announced in May, the EU had already secured hundreds of millions of vaccines from several drug-makers, including another 600 million doses from Pfizer and BioNTech under two previous contracts with the two companies. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19

For many, who don’t just dislike their new communist rulers but have already offended them by expressing their views, even returning on holiday would be dangerous.The new arrivals are predominantly not the wealthy Hong Kongers who have been buying up luxury properties in London and investment properties across the country for years, but what in Hong Kong would be called “grassroots” people and here we would call middle class – corporate and civil service employees, IT specialists, engineers, accountants, business owners and their families.Educated, motivated, often strongly Christian, with democratic ideals, good English and – importantly – not inconsiderable funds, they share a desire to make a new life and “not to be any trouble”.And these prospective model British citizens are arriving daily in their hundreds, with boxes of possessions, children, grandparents and even pets. One Hong Konger, starting a fairly modest job that he had already lined up with a luxury goods company in London, told his new colleagues he had spent £3,000 shipping the family guinea pig in the cargo hold: “You don’t want to upset the kids before they’ve even arrived in the country.”Having scrutinised the advantages and attractions of hundreds of possible places to live – property prices, school league tables, hospitals and train links – online, from 6,000 miles away, the newcomers are fanning out across the country, with some arranging home rentals for a year (rent paid upfront, as they have no credit history) to get a feel for an area and pooling information with people back home on WhatsApp groups.Others are ing straight in and buying newbuilds, which many Chinese people love. Some of the more traditional are said to be nervous of secondhand houses because of concerns about ghosts or just a dislike of used possessions. Others still are buying two newbuild homes on the same development. Or three. One will typically be for the family, the second for the elderly parents, the third to rent out to provide the basis of an income.Most buyers pay cash. House prices in Hong Kong, even out in the rural New Territories, are at London levels and selling even a small property can pay for a lot of bricks and mortar in places you might not expect to be on Hong Kong people’s radar, like Warrington (where sales are hitting double figures on one new estate), Ebbsfleet in Kent (ditto) or Okehampton in Cornwall.There are areas the new Hong Kongers favour, such as Kingston and its surrounds in south-west London, but “Hong Kong buyers are location agnostic”, says James Holmear, sales director of Redrow, one of the many housebuilders assiduously cultivating the burgeoning market. “Most of our houses have a Thirties arts and crafts design they love, so they’ll say, often on video calls while they’re still in Hong Kong, ‘We want that house.’ We’ll say, ‘Yes, but where would you like it?’ And they’ll reply, ‘Where are you building them?’ And often, when they’ve researched it, for schools in particular, they’ll buy off-plan before they’ve even arrived here. They move very fast.” Redrow has sold nearly 100 new homes to Hong Kongers since July.When it comes to employment, the newcomers are typically flexible and pragmatic while focused and ambitious. Two years ago, Mike Hui, 38, was in the thick of the democracy protests in Hong Kong as a photographer with the radical tabloid Apple News, which the Beijing-controlled authorities closed down last June. What was happening to his homeland stopped him sleeping and made him cry. “I’m a reporter, but I am a Hong Konger more,” he says.He and his wife, Ardis, who was a training officer for a restaurant chain, saw the way things were going early and got out with their five-year-old daughter, Ellie, before the newspaper was shut down. They headed for Leeds, popular with Hong Kongers and where Hui has a cousin. They brought just 20 boxes of possessions – as well as a not insignificant £1.2 million from the sale of their house in the New Territories.  For now, Hui is delivering meals for a Chinese takeaway, while his wife works in a warehouse. But they have already bought a three-bedroom Redrow semi which will adjoin a house bought by friends from home. And Hui is already doing freelance photography – as well as thinking of setting up his own Chinese takeaway. Ellie, meanwhile, loves her new school.The Hui family’s is a classic story of the Hong Kong newcomer, with its themes of foresight, bravery – they had never been to the UK – self-reliance and financial savvy. There is another sub-theme, too they are vocally grateful to Britain – and specifically to the Conservative Government – for letting them take refuge here and are patriotic towards their new country.“We will never be able to go back to Hong Kong,” says Michael, a young former democracy campaigner, now living in Kingston, “but we’re still proud of it and we don’t want to give it a bad name.” Previously an event organiser, he quickly trained as a men’s barber when he got to London. He is now planning his own salon – before long, he hopes, a chain of them.And therein lies one of many peculiar features of this wave of immigration, which could soon make ex-Hong Kongers one of the most sizeable groups to settle in the UK.Economists have taken note that almost half plan to start their own business – and have the money to do so – that most are aged 30-50 and all are well educated with good English and more than 10 years’ experience in a professional field. This makes them a huge asset – especially to a tired old country with 2.5 million job vacancies.Politically, however, it is treading on thin ice to applaud a huge influx of anglophile, entrepreneurial Chinese people, suggesting as it does that other waves of immigration have been less successful for one reason or another. Which would be rather hurtful to millions of already successful, patriotic immigrants and their children born here.So, search for a public figure of Right or Left saying outright that the Hong Kongers are an asset and you will not find much – even though they patently are. Conservatives, additionally, must have realised that three million or so new citizens who are effectively fleeing socialism – and are hugely thankful to British Tories – could be quite helpful at the ballot box in the near future.Left-wing commentators, meanwhile, have already been growling that “the good migrant narrative” is racist, even if it is celebratory. Academics, similarly, have weighed in against stereotypes of Hong Kongers’ self-reliance and industriousness.Ex-Hong Kongers are a very unusual immigrant population. Some have drawn parallels to previous waves of talented, educated settlers whose lives had been made intolerable by hateful dictators, but rose quickly to the top of all walks of British life. Think only of the Jews fleeing Hitler in the Thirties and the Ugandan Asians thrown out by Idi Amin in 1972. But numbers in each case were tiny – there were just 28,000 Ugandan Asian refugees – and both groups arrived in Britain largely penniless. Most now fleeing Hong Kong are bringing their money with them and are, as one technology company boss keen on employing as many as possible said last week: “Plug and play – they are ready to work, and work smartly, from day one. We have been hugely impressed.”What about the other pervasive stereotype, of genius Hong Kong-born children? A teacher at a small working-class primary school in Nottingham which has taken nine refugee pupils – making them the largest ethnic group on the roll – confirms that it may be exaggerated, but along the right lines.“Not one of these kids has been a problem for us. There’s no need to support them with additional English. They’re highly motivated. One lad who doesn’t say much in class just aced it and got 40 out of 40 in his Year 5 arithmetic test, and also did amazingly well in English. The teacher was really surprised, but we found that they were way ahead of us at his school in Hong Kong.”There are a couple of culture shocks, the teacher adds. “They’re masked up all the time, while our Covid measures amount to opening a window.”To spend any time with the new generation of Hong Kong refugees and see the UK through their enthusiastic, grateful eyes is also rather salutary for any native-born Brit a little jaundiced about today’s UK.Pastor Johnny Chan, who came to Leeds in 1969 and worked as a dentist, now leads one of the city’s five Chinese Christian churches, between the Emmerdale Farm studios and the Headingley cricket ground. Sunday services now attract almost 300 people, including 40 or 50 new immigrant families.“We Chinese think when we go to a new place, we have to respect the people, the traditions and the law of the land,” he says. “And for the new people, freedom, democracy, British culture and the rule of law are wonderful things that they experienced in the past and are now seeing taken away at home.“Also, they are startled by the courtesy here. We Chinese aren’t as courteous as the British. All our people say they’re made incredibly welcome here. We hear lots of stories about neighbours giving people furniture, of them teaching our people how things work that they’ve never seen before – like central heating.”Ask about anti-Chinese racism and he laughs. “The answer is really, no. Not a thing. But you know,” he smiles, “we Chinese can be pretty racist ourselves. We are not about to accuse others without getting our own house in order. We’re just incredibly grateful to the British government for allowing potentially more than three million Hong Kong folks to come here.”Pastor Chan warns that stories of unhappy Hong Kong immigrants will inevitably come up – but that Britain should be a little sceptical about them. “Propaganda is the one thing the Chinese Communist Party is good at,” he says. “When there were stories of empty supermarket shelves and petrol shortages, they made sure the media in Hong Kong went big on it to discourage people from leaving.”Hong Kongers who are loyal to Beijing are a rarity, but not unknown. Christine Lee, a solicitor in Birmingham and London named earlier this month by MI5 as an agent working covertly for the Chinese government, reportedly came with her parents from Hong Kong to Northern Ireland in 1974.Such stories are highly anomalous, however. In Mill Hill, north London, Lore Chan and her husband Bernard, also a dentist but no relation of Pastor Johnny, are active in helping and encouraging new Hong Kong people to settle through the Chinese church in Brook Green, Hammersmith.“There’s a lot for the new people to give up,” Mr Chan says. “As long as their children settle in school, that’s their priority.” Professionals can struggle a little with having to slip down a rung or two into lower quality jobs. “Others go to great efforts to keep up their status and income. Many work through the night online, doing their Hong Kong job – often in finance or tech – and not telling anyone they’re in the UK.”“Some of our younger people like my sister, who was born here, used to say they felt they were born in the wrong country, because they loved Hong Kong so much. But you don’t hear that any more.”More from News Politics latest news: National Insurance rise is the only \u0026#39responsible\u0026#39 decision, insists minister amid Tory backlashStorm Corrie: Thousands of homes still without power and schools with no heating forced to shutTwo police officers shot dead in GermanyBritish Summer Time 2022: When do the clocks change?Lyrid meteor shower 2022: how to watch the peak and other key UK datesChinese New Year 2022: Everything you need to know about the Year of the TigerMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"council wont say residents low traffic neighbourhood objections","story":"A council refused to tell a resident whether her views were included in a public consultation about low traffic neighbourhoods (LTNs) because it would be an “unfair” breach of her privacy.Brenda Cayman used Freedom of Information laws to see if her response to an online council survey had been included in a review of controversial road closures.The mother of three lives on the boundary road between Streatham Hill and Tulse Hill in south London but believes Lambeth Council’s introduction of two LTNs has resulted in a “staggering increase” in traffic.Last autumn she filled in two reviews about the Oval and Railton LTNs - one near her home and the other which she travelled through to get to work.“Quite a few local residents were concerned that those opposed to LTNs had been ignored in this research,” Ms Cayman, 51, said. “We were so concerned that our responses had been excluded that we resorted to Freedom of Information requests to see if they had been included.”The council has spent up to £4 million promoting walking and cycling in the borough with a series of LTNs before conducting telephone, online and email consultations to gauge public opinion about the new road layouts.Among the thousands of responses received “a number were identified as being suspicious in nature, or potential duplicates” and were “excluded”, a council report said.Of the 8,000 responses, nearly 2,000 were classified as “duplicates” or “suspicious”.In Lambeth’s reply to Ms Cayman’s request, the authority said that while it did know whether her two forms were included, it was “withholding that information” because it was “personal data”.“As it is information about someone else I’m unable to give this to you,” the council official wrote.Ms Cayman said: “The refusal to say whether my voice was heard fuels the idea this consultation has been unfair. It feels a wholly undemocratic process.”A Lambeth Council spokesman said: “Our low traffic neighbourhood consultations have been carried out using internal expertise and in line with national guidance issued by the Department for Transport. Systra, a leading and independent transport consultancy, then carried out unbiased consultation analysis.“This included following well-established practice for excluding duplicate and suspicious submissions – work that was carried out by independent, impartial researchers as part of efforts to produce accurate and honest analysis to inform the council’s decision making.“By law we cannot release personal information via Freedom of Information requests.

The ex-No aide branded the Prime Minister a complete ****wit and accused Mr Johnson and his we Carrie of rattling around in there and ****ing everything up for everyone.In an interview with New York Magazine, Mr Cummings accused the PM of being obsessed with infrastructure projects that can act as monuments to him like a Roman emperor. And he claimed Mr Johnson was fixated on media coverage of matters such as whether Big Ben would bong for Brexit rather than policy issues.Downing Street declined to comment on his latest tirade against the PM.  The former Vote Leave campaigner has gone to war with his former boss after being forced out of Downing Street in November  following a power struggle. Mr Cummings, who famously faced a public backlash for his lockdown trip to Durham, stoked the partygate saga engulfing No by revealing the bash on May   - a BYOB drinks party in the Downing Street garden. He admitted he was trying to oust the PM, which he said was “an unpleasant but necessary job. It’s like sort of fixing the drains, he added.Mr Johnson was critical in delivering Brexit and defeating Jeremy Corbyn at the  election, the ex-aide said.“But after that what’s the point of him and Carrie just rattling around in there and ****ing everything up for everyone and not doing the job properly,” he said. Mr Cummings said he got fed up in January  by the Prime Ministeraposs obsession with whether Big Ben would toll on Brexit day. I was sitting in No.  with Boris and the complete ****wit is just babbling on about: ‘Will Big Ben bong for Brexit on the st of January ’  He goes on and on about this day after day. Eventually I say to him: ‘Who cares  What are you talking about  Why are you babbling on about Big Ben  It’s completely ludicrous. We won the election a few weeks ago. We have an eighty-seat majority. He claimed the PM, who supposedly dreamed of being world king as a child, is fixated on what would a Roman emperor do. Mr Cummings said the PM fantasises about “monuments to him in an Augustine fashion. ‘I will provide the money. I will be a river to my people. I will provide the money that builds the train station in Birmingham.’ Or whatever. ‘And it will have statues to me, and people will remember me after I am dead like they did the Roman emperors.’ His latest intervention comes as the Prime Minister battles to save his premiership from the fallout of the Downing Street party saga.

I love Ian Rankin but I find myself reading them not for the plots – like I did at the start – but more for what’s been going on with Rebus. And that’s the way things are round here these days. There’s a cost of living crisis coming, war brewing, all sorts of problems, but the most fascinating thing is the psychodrama going on around the PM and Sue Gray.  It was due Thursday, then possibly Friday. Now they reckon it’s due tomorrow. What’s in there, do you think  What’s the hold-up  It seems pretty clear that it’s not going to be good news for the PM. People I speak to in Whitehall tell me they had to change their media lines because it went from “very bad” to “terrible” very quickly. The excitement. Labour is in a slightly tricky position. The bind seems to be, do you want Mr Johnson to stay or keep the pressure on and kick him out  There are two schools of thought. The first is that it would be beneficial to keep him around, kick him repeatedly until the next election and then let him limp into a defeat. The danger with that strategy is thatMr Johnson rides this crisis out we will head into the summer, the Commonwealth Games, the Jubilee celebrations, the weather, and everyone’s mood picks up, and all this becomes a distant memory.  Mr Johnson becomes a good-time PM again. The other danger is that you would be letting a lame duck run the show during an exceptionally dficult time for the country. The other school of thought is that taking a scalp at any time is good. Also,Rishi Sunak is the favourite to take over, it might be quite nice to have him in place. A new billionaire PM – and former hedge fund boss – as we stagger into the cost of living crisis. That’s quite easy to frame for a Labour attack. Anyways. We’ll see. Maybe Tuesday. We are in the hands of Sue Gray, who sounds like she knows what she’s doing and – as civil servants go – is an interesting character. Thorough and no-nonsense are the words used to describe her. Fair is another. Ms Gray used to run a pub in Northern Ireland, which suggests she knows a party when she sees one. And her husband is a country and western singer.

Ahead of the Government finally publishing its levelling up blueprint this week, the Labour frontbencher accused ministers of being too ided and fundamentally lacking ambition.The Shadow Communities Secretary also vowed Labour would win back votersapos trust saying levelling-up was personal to her.In an interview with the Mirror, she said: I live in Wigan, my family are growing up there. When my child is older I want him to have the choice to be able to stay and to contribute,thataposs what he wants to do. When I talk to all the people who have children whoaposve had to move hundreds of miles away for work, who donapost know theyaposll see their grandchildren and are growing older alone at the other end of the country. It breaks my heart. Ms Nandy strongly rejected claims that Labour was not a patriotic party, saying she was proud to fly the flag.  She said: I do find it strange that we would face criticism for loving the country that we want to lead. I would say thataposs a basic prerequisite for seeking office. You have to believe in the country and want it to succeed, but that is about more than just the flag. When I see the Tories claiming to be patriots, while theyaposre leaving our children to go hungry during school holidays, when I see them stripping power and money out of communities across the country... it makes me quite angry that they could claim to be the patriots. Ms Nandy claimed the Tories were too ided to deliver on levelling up, with Rishi Sunakaposs tax hike stripping spending power from communities and putting cash into cities, while leaving public transport deserts into regions like the North East.She said the Chancellor and Michael Gove were also at loggerheads over where skills cash would go.The major problem thataposs emerged for the Conservatives over the last two years is they canapost agree what levelling up is, she said.  And they have a Chancellor who fundamentally doesnapost believe thatpower and opportunity was spread much more widely, the entire country would be better off. Weaposve got a Chancellor who is still very very wedded to a model that puts more and more power and resources into places that are already doing well. Turning to how the Government would fund skills, she said the shared prosperity fund cannot be used to pump cash into Tory seats and target areas. Thereaposs a huge issue here. If youaposre going to move jobs to Darlington or where, young people in those places have to be able to get those jobs, she said. Itaposs not good enough just to move people from London to other parts of the country, youaposve got to invest in young people in our towns to ensure that they can get the jobs of the future. If you want to level up a place, you have to level up the people in it. The Wigan MP said Labouraposs £bn-a-year climate investment pledge would create high-quality jobs in regions and would stop the brain drain to cities. The places weaposre talking about - Grimsby, Barnsley, Aberdeen, Wigan - these are places that within living memory powered this country, and built our wealth and influence. We were at the centre of the world, and could be again.  Labouraposs vision for levelling up would be measured by a growth in local economies and a reverse in deindustrialisation, giving young people the choice to stay close to family rather than get out to get on in le. She said: For a lot of places like Grimsby, a lot of young people go to university every year and never come back. Not because they donapost want to but because the jobs just havenapost been there. We think that people in those places have a level of ambition for their communities and their families that just hasnapost been matched by the national government and for far too long. And thataposs what levelling up has to mean. It has to mean turning around  years of relative economic decline, so that young people have those choices, and those local economies can thrive again.

An exclusive poll for the Mirror found that % of people would back the Labour team to run the nationaposs finances over just % who support Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak to do it.Crucially, the findings by Deltapoll also show that Labour has a stronger reputation for economic competence than the Tories in seats which Mr Johnson gained at the last election. The results also put Mr Starmer ahead of the Prime Minister on leadership, with the Labour leader getting a + approval rating compared with Mr Johnsonaposs -.It means that the Conservatives are substantially behind Labour on both leadership and the economy - with no party ever going on to win a general election from that position. The poll gave Labour a -point lead over the Tories, one point up from the previous poll to %, suggesting the Oppositionaposs lead is holding for the time being. Labouraposs improved standing on the economy is crucial to the party being in with a chance of winning the next general election, having trailed behind for years. Cost of living pressures facing Britain are likely to increase this Spring with soaring inflation, tax hikes and energy bill increases all on the horizon.Mr Johnson has doubled down on his controversial national insurance hike to boost NHS funding - despite reports he was wobbling over the issue last week as he tried to placate furious Tory MPs.Mr Sunak, who had warned that scrapping the increase would be fiscally irresponsible as it would mean more borrowing to plug the gap, won the apostug-of-warapos over the plan. But the PMaposs decision also suggests he is increasingly confident that his job is safe for now after Sue Grayaposs report into No  gatherings was delayed.

Perhaps it will be released as an opera, so it will cost £ for a ticket to see it. Then we’ll see a chorus of tenors singing “why do you leave us, do not forsake us ” Then the sopranos will reply “We go to Waitrose, to fetch more wine,” in red chfon dresses. Then a booming bass roars cheekily “It’s a workplace meeting”, all in Italian. It’s possible the report has become more complicated because it turns out Prince Andrew was at one of the parties.  Or maybe she can’t finish it because there was a -piece swing band playing in the No bathroom throughout lockdown, and  people re-enacting the Battle of El Alamein in the kitchen, so she has to interview all of them. But now the Met Police have been kind enough to make her job simpler. Because they insist her investigation should leave out anything about the parties. And an investigation is always easieryou don’t have to include anything that you were investigating. To keep the police and the Government happy, her report should go: “On Tuesday it was quite sunny. The end.” Then she can pad it out with  pages of dot-to-dot puzzles and a nice picture of farmyard animals, with suggestions for how to colour them in. The police can make their own lives simpler by applying the same rules to themselves. When they investigate a robbery, they can leave out everything about the robbery from their investigation and they’ll be able to complete their task much more quickly. When the police announced they were investigating the parties, we were told this meant the report might be delayed for several more weeks. That would be convenient. Maybe they’ll keep this going. So next time the report’s about to appear, it will be announced that the Vatican are investigating the parties to see whether they constituted a mortal sin. So the report can’t be published until there’s a pronouncement from the Pope. In any case, the Government’s supporters now say the whole business of parties against the rules is “trivia”. Why are we bothering with wine and cakes, when there’s inflation and a might-be-a-war with Russia   This would make sense,when Johnson was reading out the rules every single day for several months, he’d said: “But don’t bother sticking to any of this. “You can do whatever you like, I’d invite your mates round and spend all day naked mud-wrestlingI was you. Remember – Hands – Face – Cake – Bottle – Conga.” But they insisted we absolutely had to stay alone, while they did the opposite. Andyou were cynical, you might suspect thatthey lie so blatantly about that, maybe it’s possible that they lie about everything  as well.

Ministers want to help transform derelict parts of  towns and cities in England, with new housing and jobs, through its blueprint. Sheffield and Wolverhampton have been chosen as the first places to benefit from the regeneration funding.But hours after Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove announced the chosen locations for a £. billion brownfield fund, he was forced to admit the money had already been announced.Some Tory ministers do not believe the plans are ambitious enough and that the public will see through attempts to repackage proposals that have already been announced.  One told the Mirror: This is our main policy offer to thousands of people who voted for us in aposred wallapos seats or the first time in . Whataposs on the table now is just too meagre to persuade them weaposll deliver the change we promised. Labouraposs Lisa Nandy said: “This recycled money, which gives us a bit of a refund in a few places on the money that we’ve lost, just completely missed the point. People need money back in their pockets. We need good jobs and wages.Analysis by Labour has found that virtually every area of England has received less in funding on average since , as a result of spending cuts, than they received from regional development funds like the Towns Fund. The Government has been accused of trying to manipulate announcements on extra funding for poorer parts of the UK in a desperate attempt to save Boris Johnson ’s premiership.Ms Nandy claimed the Tories had been caught out trying to spin that extra money had been found for poorer areas when the white paper actually contained nothing new.  “I don’t think Tory MPs are going to find it very reassuring when the supposed new pot of gold contains not a penny of new money,” she said. Lib Dem deputy leader Daisy Cooper said the episode showed the government was not “remotely serious about levelling up this country.” A separate £. billion Levelling Up Home Building Fund will also be launched next week, providing loans to small and medium-size builders and developers to deliver , homes. The vast majority will go outside London and the South East, although the Government has said the cash for this fund was first announced in .

Johnson would accuse Putin of authoritarianism and state corruption had a Moscow police chief – controversially reappointed by the president – refused for weeks to ­investigate alleged Kremlin law-breaking until, on the eve of a potentially damaging report, a probe is finally announced.

The guidelines introduced last year have been changing gradually and working from home orders have also come to an end. Monday will see curbs being relaxed in care homes as aposliving withapos the virus becomes the latest instruction by the UK Government. Cases are plummeting and the aposRapos rate has also dropped to its lowest since March . Limits had been introduced on care home visits under Plan B curbs allowing millions to spend time with their nearest and dearest. But the three-visitor restriction will also be dropped from Monday in all care homes.  Workers will have to take lateral flow tests before every sht from February . Weekly PCR tests are currently required along with lateral flow tests three times a week.Almost nine in ten care home residents had been triple jabbed Health secretary Sajid Javid said, allowing visiting rules to be relaxed.He said: I know how vital companionship is to those living in care homes and the positive dference visits make, which is why we continued to allow three named visitors and an essential care giver under Plan B measures. Thanks to the progress we have made, I am delighted that care home restrictions can now be eased further allowing residents to see more of their loved ones, he said.JabsMore Brits will also be able to get their Covid jabs from Monday Vulnerable five to  year olds can from Monday have their first jab to protect against Covid. Vaccines were given to some youngsters in December and NHS chiefs are preparing for a rollout.But young people cannot be given the same dose size as adults. Around , selected children will receive two doses of a small dose of the vaccine, with an eight week gap between each injection. Face masks In public places in England mask wearing rules were scrapped at midnight last Thursday. People were required to wear a mask on public transport and in shops, post offices, banks, beauty salons, hairdressers, theatres and cinemas. But now they will be allowed to visit these places without a mask.  They are still being advised to continue wearing them in busy areas or on public transport. Proof of vaccination or a negative test to visit large venues like football grounds and nightclubs will no-longer be required. Vaccine passports And vaccine passports for domestic use will be dropped at midnight. Boris Johnson faced a huge Commons rebellion when the measure was introducedThe Government justied vaccine proof as it was preferable to closing venues entirely or re-imposing social distancing. Travel Holidaymakers will no longer required to provide covid tests from am on February . Grant Shapps said arrivals to the country will only need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form when entering the UK,they have had both jabs. He said: From am on February , and in time for the half-term break, eligible, fully vaccinated passengers arriving in the UK will no longer have to take a post-arrival lateral flow test. That means after months of pre-departure testing, post-arrival testing, self-isolation and additional expense, all that fully vaccinated people will have to do when they travel to the UK is to very their status via Passenger Locator Form. We are therefore scrapping all travel tests for vaccinated people, not only making travel much easier, but also saving about £ per family on visits abroad. Those aged between  and  will be able to download digital vaccination proof, Shapps confirmed.  Isolation Those who test positive for Covid will not be legally obliged to isolate from March . People who test positive must quarantine at home for at least five full days and this is not changing. By ing two negative lateral flow tests on days five and six, it will signal the end of the isolation period. Those who are fully vaccinated and come are in contact with an infected person should test daily, but will not have to isolate so long as they remain negative. But unvaccinated people who are close contacts of others with Covid must quarantine for  days. Flouting the laws will land people with fines of up to £,.

Then, when she was just  years old, on December , , her uncle, King Edward VIII, abdicated, turning his back on the throne in pursuit of love, having reigned for just  days. Princess Elizabeth’s future was changed forever.In the first of our series celebrating Her Majesty’s jubilee, we mark the beginning of her ascent to the throne. For when her father Bertie, the shy and stammering Duke of York, became King George VI, the little princess quickly knew what it meant for her. Her sister Margaret is said to have asked: “Does that mean you will have to be the next queen ” Elizabeth told her: “Yes, someday.” Margaret’s answer was of pity, not envy. She said: “Poor you.”  From that day on, Elizabeth, known in childhood as Lillibet, was the Heir Presumptive rather than Heir Apparent, meaning had a brother arrived later he would have taken her place as monarch. With that unlikely, Elizabeth was thrust into training for queenship while her father, the new King George VI, was himself learning on the job. The family left their much-loved home at  Piccadilly for the grand surroundings of Buckingham Palace. Then the focus turned to Elizabeth’s education. She and Margaret had been taught by Governess Marion “Crawfie” Crawford, who later claimed the princesses’ mother, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, had little concern with it.  That’s not to say the girls were not disciplined, and, like all children, the young Elizabeth needed it from time to time. A Mirror report once told how in skirmishes with her sister, Elizabeth “was quick with her left hook”. After her destiny was transformed, Elizabeth’s education had to step up and, alongside Crawfie’s lessons, she was tutored in constitutional history by Henry Marten, then Vice-Provost at Eton. She also learned French and was said to speak it beautully - as well as getting schooled in international affairs. Elizabeth’s preparations for the throne were interrupted when Britain went to war in . Along with her sister, and millions of children across the country, she was issued with a gas mask and spent her evenings in darkness during the blackout. She and Margaret prepared for air raids by sleeping in their siren suits.  After a brief spell in Scotland, the future Queen was moved to Windsor for the Christmas of , and stayed there for the rest of the war with Margaret, while her parents were at Buckingham Palace.In October , Elizabeth’s preparations for the throne took a leap forward with her first address to the country, broadcast to children of Britain and the Commonwealth at home and overseas during the BBC ’s Children’s Hour.At just  years old, Princess Elizabeth spoke to young people explaining how she could relate to their plight. She said: “My sister, Margaret Rose, and I feel so much for you, as we know from experience what it means to be away from those we love most.”  She then did her best to rally a nation facing more years of conflict with the Nazis.

In the legend, the tiger was so confident that no one could compete with its speed and vigor, it was certain it would win the celestial competition. As the tiger climbed out of the river assuming it was first, it was shocked to find that the rat had actually won for its cunning, and the ox had placed second for its diligence - leaving it in third place. While perhaps they can think a lot of themselves, people born in the year of the tiger have several admirable traits - they are typically thought to be brave, forceful, powerful, confident and independent. And when it comes to love, they are the most compatible with those born in the year of the dragon, horse and pig, whose personalities often complement these traits.

The super-sized sea creatures have been showing up off the Yorkshire coast, where they’ve prompted feelings of both fear and joy among fishermen.The iety of crab has a hard upper shell and can measure a huge  inches across the body. While the sweet-fleshed species’ popularity with chefs means they are a lucrative catch for fishermen, there are also fears the monsters might chomp up all of the scallops and brown crabs.One fisherman told theSun Online: “I’m really excited, but worried about our native seafood.” Giant red king crabs are native to North America, though scientists introduced them to Russia in the s and they thrived in the Arctic Ocean. They soon exploded in numbers, with fishermen benefiting financially from their adundance. The huge crabs then travelled to ­Norway, where they sparked another fishing boom. Most recently, the crabs have been found in UK waters where, aside from the odd one fished up in recent years, they have never been seen in signicant numbers. Fish supplier Shaun Henderson, who sells to more than  restaurants, said one of his fishermen pulled up st of king crabs off Bridlington, East Yorks this week.  It was the first time anyone in his family had caught a king crab, he said, despite them having fished in the area for two generations. While he was excited about the new catch, he was also wary, he said, due to how invasive the species seemed. The giant crabs appeared to be eating both the scallops and the brown crabs, which made Mr Henderson worry about seafood native to the UK. He said king crabs had made fishermen a lot of money in Norway, but had simultaneously depleted the populations of other sea creatures. While Will Murray, head chef at Fallow restaurant in St James’s Market, central London, has bought some of the crabs, he said he has “mixed feelings” about their appearance in the UK. While he described the giant crabs as a premium ingredient that accounted for some of the best seafood in the world, he noted there were possibly negative implications of their appearance. “We’re excited, but a bit terried, as they are invaders and could kill our brown crabs,” he said. He said the species could be the next grey squirrel, but at least they were easy to cook and enjoyable to eat.

He wrote: Perhaps, I thought, they were wearing them against air pollution, which is bad at the moment. Or because it was a cold morning and they actively enjoyed the warmth of their foetid breath circulating inside the germy fabric  Or perhaps, I supposed, these masked ninnies were still so afraid of the now-harmless bug that they were prepared to endure the mild discomfort and inconvenience that comes with the illusion of security provided by a mask.  Or perhaps, in their post-pandemic health hysteria, they were hoping now to protect themselves against flu, measles, hepatitis ... even cancer  . While masks are no longer a legal requirement in England, there are still some settings where they are recommended. Londoners need to keep wearing them when using Transport for London services.  While London Mayor Sadiq Khanaposs demands are not enforceable by police and do not carry a fine, face masks will remain a condition of carriage on TfL services. That means you can be refused admission to a Tube or bus without one. Mr Khan urged the PM to rethink scrapping face masks altogether.He said: Wearing a face covering is one of the single most important and easiest things we can all do to prevent the spread of Covid- and the Government should rethink their plans.Some supermarkets will continue to either ask or suggest that shoppers wear a mask. Sainsbury’s and John Lewis said their customers will be asked to wear masks, though the latter acknowledged it will ultimately come down to “personal choice”.

I’m not an expert, so don’t knowshe’s an alcoholic, but I think it’s possible. She’s in her late-s and has lived alone since my father died  years ago. She does have friends and manages tomost of the time, but sometimes she’s so drunk she can barely speak. She also turns up to things drunk and is completely unreliable. When I’ve asked her to look after my kids she hasn’t turned up, saying later she’d got the dates mixed up. She can go through periods of being better and almost like her old self, but it doesn’t last very long. I have tried speaking to her gently, but she gets very defensive, even angry, so I don’t push it for fear she’ll have a huge drinking binge. Recently, she put her car in a ditch and was arrested for drink driving, but even that hasn’t appeared to knock any sense into her. I don’t know what to do to help her. I did call the GP, who wasn’t massively helpful. I’d appreciate any advice you can offer. What would you tell this reader to do  Have your say in the comment section...  Coleen says I think it’s time to be less gentle and more direct. Try scheduling a time to sit down with her – like my daughter does with me now and again – and tell her the truth as you see it. Yes, the truth hurts, but hopefully she’ll go away and think about things and see the impact she’s having on others, too. Her first reaction might be anger and she might chuck you out, but she will register what you’ve said. Don’t be ­accusatory, but tell her you love her, you’re worried about her and you’re worried about leaving your kids with her, then ask what you can do to help. The bottom line is that she needs to accept she has a problem before she can help herself and let others help her too. There’s bound to be an underlying issue such as grief or feeling unworthy, lonely or depressed, and she is ­self-medicating. She could start by agreeing to visit her GP and finding out what help is available to her in terms of counselling or medication. You could offer to go with her. I thinkthe conversation is coming from a place of support, then you will have a better chance of getting through to her. Good luck.

Kieran McLaughin, , is celebrating gaining five stone as it marks a major recovery milestone from his ongoing fight with Crohnaposs Disease.The lelong condition causes parts of the digestive system to become inflamed and can be crippling for those suffering with it. A healthy teenager, Kieran from Hamilton in Scotland, initially thought he had a bad bug and was left terried when his immune system began attacking itself causing him severe pain, chronic cramps and hair and weight loss. Exhausted and depressed his weight dropped to just six stone, but he was determined to get better and has gone up four waist sizes in lockdown.Speaking to DailyRecord the software tester said it felt good to reach a healthy weight of st.  He said: It was nice to look in a mirror and see a physical milestone of how I was recovering and how lucky I was that my body responded with the medications and ongoing treatments. “Recently it’s a lot better, I’m on immunosuppressant drugs weekly which has kept my Crohnaposs in check and the colostomy bag has completely changed my le. “I’ve put on a lot more weight with working from home and being able to eat meals at the right times, since the start of lockdown I’ve gone up four waist sizes. “It made me worry seeing my body shape change and having clothes being too small even though looking back I realise how thin and unhealthy I looked at the time. “But it was a sign my medication was working and things were better health-wise and now I’m a lot happier with it as I’m now a healthy weight for my height and age. “I feel a lot more confident now with it as it’s no hassle at all to change when I’m out and my girlfriend, family and friends have been really supportive. Kieranaposs le was turned upside down when he was diagnosed with Crohnaposs disease at the age of  in . He first realised something was wrong when began suffering extreme pains and discovered blood in the toilet. Kieran was forced to undergo several surgeries to drain an abscess as a result of violent flare-ups. In  his weight dropped to just six stone, but in four years he managed to reach eight stone and was determined to keep gaining weight.  Kieran explained: “It’s weird, it almost came out of nowhere for me. I thought I had a bad bug but then it never went away. It was a shock as it’s caused by problems with your immune system so at  when I had never really had any bad sickness but then got diagnosed with a disease that was causing my immune system to attack my insides. “I was so ill I was dropping weight, had severe cramps and going to the toilet constantly throughout the day with lots of blood. “I ended up having to get a colostomy bag fitted to relieve the abscess. That was really scary at the time but now I can’t imagine my le without it, it’s brought a lot more comfort to my le. I always felt really fatigued which came with me feeling really depressed with it. I always had to considerthere would be toilets wherever I was going and hope I didn’t feel wiped out, I missed out on quite a lot because of this.

He is urging anyone worried about their health to contact their GP to aposavoid things potentially getting worse.apos Kieran added: “To anyone  that’s going through I’d say the same, take each day as it comes even and never feel guiltyyou take a few days in bed to recover. “Don’t feel embarrassed discussing it either because I was in the same boat early days where I’d feel so embarrassed talking about the symptoms but now I can talk about it without a second thought. “Even telling my now-girlfriend that I had a colostomy bag on our first date because I’d over thought how to bring it up so I just ended up blurting it out haha! “Take it from someone who almost always puts off phoning about a new pain or new symptom, it’s best to phone the doctors early on and avoid things potentially getting worse.”You can find out more about Crohn’s disease and how to manage it here.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Fabio CarvalhoDancing on IceImmune systemTeenagersPrescriptionsTalent showsCrohns disease\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The monarch marks  years on the throne this summer, with celebrations set to take place over a special four-day bank holiday in June.There has been much doubt whether the Duke and Duchess of Sussex woulddue to issues over security - having forgone some privileges on stepping down as working royals.But a royal and PR expert says it would actually be good for both of them to make time for the overseas reunion. Pauline Maclaran is a professor of marketing and consumer research at the School of Management at Royal Holloway and author of Royal Fever. She told thethe Sussexes need their connections within the Firm and could get involved to top up their brand.Professor Maclaran said she believes the Royal Family itself would benefit from the ersity Meghan brings. I think that would benefit both brands because it would be seen as a kind of reconciliation, Professor Maclaran said. I think it would add to the royal celebrations to have the element of ersity reclaimed that they seem to have lost through the sort of rupture of the relationship with Meghan.  So I think that would be a very good thing. She continued: It kind of seems unlikely to me that itaposs going to happen but there are a few months intervening before so maybe there will be. I think it would be very good for the Sussex brand as well as they really need to maintain those sort of royal connections to really validate their brand, otherwise what are they.  So because it might benefit them more than the actual Royal Family brand that might in fact encourage them to make a visit to top up their brand as it were with a little bit of royal shimmer and glimmer. Harry, , and Meghan, , are now living with their children Archie and Lilibet in Montecito, Calornia, after quitting royal duties in March . The Duke of Sussex has ed to the UK twice since then - for his grandfather Prince Philipaposs funeral in April last year and for the unveiling of his late mum Princess Dianaaposs statue in July. However, Meghan hasnapost made a comeback to the UK since leaving and the Royal Family members are yet to meet the coupleaposs daughter. Harry is in the midst of taking legal action against the British Government in a row over security, arguing it would be too dangerous for his family towithout police protection. He filed a claim last September for a judicial review against the Home Office decision not to allow him to personally pay for police protection. The Sussexes fund a private security team in the US, but it does not have adequate jurisdiction abroad or access to UK intelligence information.

It is claimed he said he wanted to “capture something small and use it for days”. Brueckner,  – in jail in Germany for raping a pensioner – wrote from his cell that the idea he abducted Madeleine is as “absurd as starting a nuclear war”. He lived in the Algarve in Portugal when the British youngster vanished from her holiday villa there in  - when she was three. Brueckner’s lover at the time, Nicole Fehlinger, , says he told her he liked the bodies of pre-pubescent girls. German prosecutors think he took Madeleine, but he denies involvement and no charges have been brought against him. Brueckner claims he is happy to sit back and relax and just wait for their findings. While protesting his innocence during a letter exchange with an investigative reporter Brueckner admitted being a drug dealer and said he used his battered camper van to traffic drugs. He wrote: I was never caught by the police because I followed a few key principles.

So when her right-hand woman Angela Kelly played a cruel practical joke on Her Majesty, the monarch responded in a typical witty way - by jokingly telling her she was sacked. Angela, who has worked for the Queen for many years, revealed the trick she played on her boss during a Royal Tour of Australia in . Writing in her book The Other Side of the Coin, the dresser explained that the Queen was desperate to see a kookaburra while Down Under.  Unfortunately, the Queen had trouble spotting one, but Angela saw a cute cuddly toy version at a Sydney market and decided to buy it and give it to her - but not before a little fun first. She writes: I had something in mind I thought the Queen would enjoy. When she got back to Governoraposs House, where they were all staying, she placed the toy in a little cage on the balcony outside her room.

She then told the Queen she had spotted a funny-looking grey bird through the window. Angela added: The Queen looked outside and shouted aposItaposs a kookaburra!apos I went to open the cage doors and she said loudly aposNo! Donapost do that! It will fly away!apos and was behind me in a flash.  Turning to her Majesty while trying to keep a straight face, I solemnly told her it was dead. The Queen looked horried until Angela walked towards her with outstretched arms and said April Fool. She explained: She had only two words for me: Youaposre sacked. I was laughing uncontrollably as her Majesty turned to His Royal Highness and said Do you know what she has just done to me  Angela has had me!. The Queen took the little toy back to Windsor Castle with her and it now lives on the back of the sofa in her private living room. Last weekend, the Queen left Windsor, where she spent the Christmas period, and travelled to Sandringham to spend the next few weeks.She is currently staying at the private Wood Farm, a cottage, where the late Prince Philip spent much of his final years.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Angela KellyThe QueenRoyal Family\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They also facilitated one last act of kindness from the physicistProfessor Stephen Hawking would have celebrated his th birthday today Image: PAByAriane Sohrabi-ShirazSEO Editor:,  Jan |commentsWorld-famous theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking passed away on March ,  - leaving behind a huge legacy. He had spent his le exploring some of scienceaposs most important questions.Today, on January , Google is honouring him on what would have been his th birthday with a Doodle designed by Matthew Cruickshank.Professor Hawking was widely considered one of the greatest minds of the st century, and was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosisat the age of . The scientist was only expected to live for two years, but defied expectations by living for a further five decades.  It will come as no surprised that the groundbreaking physicistaposs last words were as profound as his entire le. What were Stephen Hawkingaposs final words  Stephen Hawkingaposs final words came in the form of a book that was completed by his family after his death, Brief Answers To The Big Questions. It includes answers to the questions that Hawking received most during his time on Earth. His final words in the book were: There is no God. No one directs the universe. It wasnapost the first time Hawking had rejected the idea of a God or higher power.  Appearing on the TV show Genius of Britain, he said: The question is: Is the way the universe began chosen by God for reasons we canapost understand, or was it determined by a law of science  I believe the second. If you like, you can call the laws of science aposGodapos, but it wouldnapost be a personal God that you could meet, and ask questions. His last personal message to readers was a more hopeful one. In the bookaposs final chapter he attempts to answer the question: How do we shape the future  His reply was: Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. What were Stephen Hawkingaposs last acts of kindness   One of Hawkingaposs final acts of kindness was paying for a grand Easter meal for hundreds of homeless people in his home city of Cambridge. On the same day as his funeral, a donation from his family helped fund the charity FoodCycleaposs Easter lunch at Wesley Methodist Church. On all the tables a note was left, reading: Todayaposs lunch is a gt from Stephen. From the Hawking family.  According to the organisers, the author and physicist was given a little cheer before nearly  people tucked into their meal. Alex Collis, FoodCycleaposs regional manager, said: The family felt they wanted to do something positive to mark the day and support people in the local community who were having a tough time. It was something that they felt Stephen would have wanted. Ms Collis added that the familyaposs generous donation meant that there were lots of extra Easter treats and they decorated the hall with beautul flowers.

Danielle Nicholls and former footballer Dean Holden faced the devastating heartache after spending nine hours waiting for a delayed flight to Lanzarote. They arrived on the Canary Island exhausted from the y journey but there was something not right with their daughter Cici. She was not her usual self, but there was aposnothing particularly tellingapos to warn the family about what would unfold.It had all been a bit of a perfect storm for us because weaposd travelled on the plane, Danielle told the Manchester Evening News. She was exhausted and really lethargic, but we put that down to her being  months and that weaposd been travelling all that time. We woke up once with her in the night and she was a little bit warm. We gave her a bit of Calpol, changed her nappy and put her back in bed. But by the time we got up the next morning we knew she wasnapost right. The couple found fame in the late s when Danielle became the face of CITV along with Stephen Mulhearn, while former footballer Dean was breaking into the first team at Bolton Wanderers. Dean enjoyed a career in the Football League, including a spell as captain of Oldham Athletic and Danielle scaled back her career to spend time raising their three young children - Joey, Ellis and Cici.  But after the family arrived in Lanzarote and Cici took a drink of water, her condition quickly deteriorated. She was rushed to a clinic on the island, where a helicopter was waiting to take her to the nearest intensive care unit. Within three hours, Cici had died. Thataposs whataposs scary for people I think - how quickly it can develop, said Danielle. She was our most laid back, chilled out kid. She had bright red hair and blue eyes, and she was dead unique looking - she looked like something out of the olden days because I used to dress her up in frills and that. Iaposd waited ages to have my little girl.Cici had suffered meningococcal septicemia - a bacterial infection which causes blood poisoning, leading to sepsis.Her death on May , , was just the beginning of the trauma and torment that would scar Danielle and Dean. The couple had to make arrangements to fly their dead daughter home, facing reluctance from airlines who feared it would aposupset other passengersapos. Danielle added: Sheaposd never, ever left my side, she hadnapost even stayed at grandmaaposs. It felt like I was in a horror movie. I canapost be scared by a horror movie anymore because my actual le was that frightening.  To hold your dead kid in your arms for two hours when she had died, just because I couldnapost let go of her. Danielle and Dean ed from the hospital to the villa, where Joey and Ellis had been staying with the presenteraposs sister Jodie and Deanaposs brother Matt. They broke the news to their young sons, then aged four and three, and the process of trying to come to terms with the tragedy began. I canapost remember the first days and weeks after she died because youaposre just in some kind of trance, said Dean.  The biggest thing is your personality just completely changes overnight - and then you start behaving in a way you never have before. Thataposs hard because people start saying aposoh youaposre not the person you used to beapos and you start fighting against it. Youaposre in your own head all the time. Having already suffered the heartache of losing their young daughter, Danielle and Dean were left fearing the worst when Ellis came down with a raging temperature on the following night. He was unwell for a couple of days but thankfully recovered. After ing to Worsley, Greater Manchester, the couple say they were only offered anti-depressants from their GP and decided against taking them.  Instead, they embarked on a process involving group therapy, hypnotherapy and a raft of coping mechanisms such as meditation and exercise, to stop them becoming aposjibbering wrecksapos. The emotional strain from what happened caused huge damage to the coupleaposs mental health and post-traumatic stress disordertook hold. Danielle said: Weaposre all very independent, weaposre all living our lives without community, which is OK until we forget there are still tragedies happening in peopleaposs lives. There would have been a time where I would talk about it and then I could feel ill for a week afterwards, said Danielle. We did that initially because we were in the spotlight, and it made us ill. Danielle and Dean struggled as they spoke to others and relived the death of their much-loved daughter. The couple say some were aposabruptapos to them, asking why they didnapost act dferently when Cici was ill, while others would cross the road to avoid speaking to them. Their experience has inspired them to be open and honest about what happened to Cici, rather than keeping quiet with a aposstf upper lipapos mentality. The couple found solace from a support group in Warrington for bereaved parents, known as Compassionate Friends, where they shared their experiences with other couples who had gone through the heartbreaking loss of a child. Dean was supported by the Professional Footballersapos Association, who helped him to see a psychotherapist. I think unless we all start talking about the bad things in le, people will feel like we felt - we felt like aliens. As they were coming to terms with the sudden loss of Cici, they still had to find work to keep providing for their two sons.  Dean had just been released by Rochdale and was approaching clubs for playing opportunities.For Danielle, who had been working on a freelance basis, Ciciaposs death came before she had been due to meet with the BBC about work on Bitesize .He said: Iaposd been to see counsellors, and it was useless, so I went to see a psychotherapist and learned how the brain works post-trauma. Iaposd be screwed without that, because I needed to understand why Iaposd gone from being this chilled out bloke to all of a sudden this raging lunatic.Danielle, Joey and Ellis, meanwhile, were supported by the charity Meningitis Now - with the boys having innovative art therapy and anger management sessions, while Danielle also had therapy sessions.The family say they donapost know where they would be without the help of Meningitis Now, which has recently asked the couple to become ambassadors for the charity. With collections at Deanaposs old football clubs Oldham, Bolton, Chesterfield, Shrewsbury and Walsall, they raised funds to give back to Meningitis Now and to fund sensory support equipment for their childrenaposs school. Only now, almost a decade since Ciciaposs death, do they feel able to be a strong voice for the charity. Danielle said: Every day you do the work. It doesnapost matter how long it is. When your kid dies, you never feel any less pain, no matter how much timeaposs gone by. Itaposs just like you learn to live with the pain. Now is the time that I want to say to people, itaposs OK to not be OK, but by being that person - not just by saying it. I know what itaposs like to have that missing part of you thataposs never going to come back.  Just taking the chance to say - I was that girl off kids TV, I had a kid died and everything went to s***, and Iaposve got mental health issues - but itaposs OK. Since Ciciaposs death, Dean and Danielle have gone on to have two more children - with eight-year-old Mitzi and three-year-old Chase joining Joey and Ellis, now aged  and  respectively. Cici is always in the familyaposs minds - with photos of the toddler put up in their Worsley home as well as in a bracelet on Danielleaposs wrist. Dean said: If there was a drug to erase Cici out of our memory - we would have lost  months of incredible memories, but they were outweighed by the pain. As you get through the therapy, that changes - now thereaposs no way weaposd ever want to forget her because we can manage the pain. We talk about Cici so much, thereaposs a massive picture of her at the top of the stairs. People will ask how many kids we have got, and itaposs a conversation wrecker but we donapost know any other way to address it, weaposll say weaposve had five but weaposve only got four. Then they feel horrible for asking, butwe just say weaposve got four we might as well just brush her out of our le. The couple use techniques like meditation, deep breathing and cold water immersion to help with their mental health ever day to avoid aposgoing to a dark placeapos. They are big advocates for therapy and the methods they have used to help them live with the pain of losing Cici. Although panic attacks can still take the couple back to the horrors of the day she died, they now feel able to bring their mental health back under control and avoid aposspirallingapos. Dean said: If Iaposm late for something, Iaposm going back to the day Cici died. I start shaking, I start panicking - and Iaposm just late, but my brain doesnapost know the dference. Weaposve spent a lot of time with a lot of good people, but there are ways of resetting by doing strategies - tapping, cold showers and whatever. “We do all kinds of weird and wonderful things that work. Dean and Danielle suffered yet more loss after Ciciaposs death, with five miscarriages in the years between Mitzi and Chase being born. Covid brought added strain - with lockdown robbing the family of their coping mechanisms following Ciciaposs death, while Deanaposs work at Bristol City kept him away from home. But now, the pair are looking forward to a bright future with their careers.Having done live Twitch streams online for gaming on the BiigNoobs channel in recent months, Danielle is hoping to get back on TV and radio, with work in the pipeline.She also took on a comedy course last summer to try a completely new experience. Danielle said: I love making people laugh, I didnapost realise how much Iaposd enjoy it. Itaposs good - but Iaposm proper scared before I go up. Iaposm doing open mics and stuff because I want to learn the trade - I want to get a bit of cred from the other comedians. Dean added: When she goes in front of a camera or goes on stage, her eyes light up. Thataposs what she was born to do. Meanwhile, having left his role at Bristol City last season, Dean is now much closer to home as assistant manager for Stoke City. Having lived through so much pain over the past decade, the couple say they are grateful for what they have, and are looking forward to the next chapter. Danielle said: Weaposve had so much sadness and tragedy, but it doesnapost mean that weaposre miserable people who donapost have a laugh, in fact quite the opposite.

The strongest gust during Storm Malik was mph in Brizlee Wood, Northumberland, on Saturday morning but there were also winds that hit mph over wide areas of Scotland, and mph in the north of England throughout the day. Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill said: That is exceptionally strong for any time of the year and there is no wonder there were signicant impacts such as power outages and damage to buildings. It is very unfortunate that things were worse than that for some people. Several schools in Aberdeenshire said they will be shut or delay opening on Monday as they struggled with power and heating problems. Storm Corrie moved eastwards across Scotland on Sunday and is set to push across the North Sea in the early hours of Monday. Winds of mph were recorded in Stornoway, on the Western Isles, as Storm Corrie began to hit the UK on Sunday night. Scotlandaposs First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the impact of Storm Corrie is likely to be signicant. She tweeted on Sunday: Work to repair the damage from Storm Malik continues. Tens of thousands have had power reconnected already - however, many will remain off supply again tonight and some, especially in north east, could be off into Tuesday. Welfare arrangements are in place. Special arrangements remain in place for vulnerable customers and local resilience partnerships continue to work with councils to provide welfare support. Strong winds are expected until the early hours of Monday and they may affect parts of Norfolk, where large waves could hit the coast. Weather warnings for wind across northern parts of Scotland are in force.  Forecasters said that people should beware of flying debris that could lead to injuries, and there may be some damage to buildings including tiles being blown from roofs. Mr Burkill said: It is not just the case of strong winds causing problems - there is also the ice risk across parts of Scotland through to the early part of Monday morning. There will be some wintry showers. Emergency services are trying to get out, utility companies are trying to make repairs and so the icy conditions are not going to make that easier for them. Ice warnings were issued by the Met Office covering Grampian, Highlands and Eilean Siar, Strathclyde and Fe on Monday as falling temperatures after Storm Corrie may see some snowfall and turn untreated surfaces icy.  Hospitality worker Clare Stirling-Turnbull, , of Powburn, Northumberland, has been without heating and electricity since am on Saturday. To make matters worse, one of the children in her family of six has Covid and is currently isolating. She said: So we canapost go to relativesapos houses... we have no electric, no heating or hot water - we do have a wood burner so can heat one room. The family were well prepared thanks to a gas barbeque, candle and hot water bottles, she said. Northern Powergrid said that around , customers, almost all in Northumberland and County Durham, had been affected by power cuts. Director Paul Glendinning said: Given what we now know, we expect that around , customers will still be off supply as we go into Monday. We have confirmed that there is around  damage points on the low voltage network that will reconnect only a small number of customers for each repair. Some , households are expected to be without power by the end of Sunday, the Scottish Government said in an update at pm on Sunday.  Deputy First Minister John Swinney said: The power companies have drafted in a large number of additional engineers and are making signicant inroads into reconnecting customers. However, we need to be aware that the arrival of Storm Corrie could hamper these efforts and add further problems. For those who will unfortunately not have power tonight, support with alternative accommodation is available to anyone who needs it. Richard Gough, of Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks , said we expect the full restoration of customer supplies from both storms to extend into the early part of next week. Rural Aberdeenshire is among the hardest-hit areas and some customers in Angus, the Highlands, the Moray coast and Perthshire were still waiting for supplies to be restored. Durham County Council, which offered free hot food and drinks to households who were without power, had teams out clearing blocked roads, footpaths and debris. ScotRail said it withdrew all of its services on Sunday night in an effort to protect passengers and railway staff. Network Rail Scotland, which said that all parts of the railway are working together, added that any other trains that ran on Sunday night had a maximum speed of mph.

Petal, a terrier-cross, was saved when a dog warden contacted the Dogaposs Trust after she was thrown over a bridge by her old owners, who intended for her to drown in the river. Her le was described as a “horror story”, but she now lives with a loving couple and has a new dog best friend,MyLondon reported .Richard Moore, manager of the centre, said: Petal is one of those horror stories. She was handed to the dog warden after reportedly being thrown from a bridge in a bin bag, and the dog warden contacted us. Got a story  Email webnews@mirror  She was immediately placed in foster care with one of our amazing canine carers who has provided her with all the love and patience she needs. Steven and Valerie Macdougall, who took Petal in last winter, immediately fell in love with her. Steven, who has worked as a dog carer for the past seven years, said: Petal came into the centre two days after we lost our cocker spaniel Ollie and as soon as I heard about her, I went straight to see her. I’ve never seen a dog so traumatised. I had this overwhelming feeling that she was meant to come home with me, almost like Ollie stepped aside to make space for her. She’s absolutely tiny - the size of a cat - but is actually about seven or eight years old. The pair decided they simply couldnapost part with Petal so decided to adopt her, giving her the happy ever after she was looking for. Steven said: We’ve seen such a lot of improvement, but it was extremely slow going until recently. “She would only play when we weren’t in the room - we set up hidden cameras to watch her. “She had shown us that she really liked to be around other dogs - much more than people - so after a long time waiting for the right match, we fostered another Dogs Trust dog, Penny. We bonded as soon as we met on the intake block, and I just knew she was the missing piece of the jigsaw in Petal’s rehabilitation.  “They clicked so quickly we’ve now adopted Penny too.” Petal and Penny are now inseparable, and with her new friendaposs help Petal is quickly gaining confidence. “It’s awful to imagine what she must have gone through. Seeing her as she is now, playing with Penny - it’s the happy ever after I was hoping for, Steven said.If youaposd like to help the Dogs Trust to continue re-homing dogs like Petal and Penny, you can donatehere .Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON DogsDogs Trust\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

They even planned to pass time on the ward by playing games together. In a TikTok video, they recalled: “When you brought cards to the hospital, thinking you would have downtime during labour. “Unfortunately, couldn’t find time to play cards between contractions, epidurals and pushing.” The sisters also clear up common misconceptions on their TikTok page.

The passive solar design means the home’s windows, walls and floors are made to collect, store, reflect and distribute energy from the sun.  The quirky design, which features a series of triangular shapes in the exterior and sloping walls, takes full advantage of the natural light with glass panes and solar  on the roof.But Facebook users were ided over whether or not they appreciated the unique look when pictures of the property were shared online – with some viewers left “dizzy”. One user said: “This gives me a headache. So many lines. Warning, don’t drink and try to navigate this house.” “I thought the floor plan would help me understand the layout. I’m more confused after looking at it,” another person commented. Someone  said: “I think all those small, weird angle choppy rooms are exhausting. No thanks.” “I knew to expect the angles and yet the sheer number of them still surprised me,” added another viewer.  However, other users loved the quirky home. One fan said: “I love unique homes like this.” “If I had a down payment right now, I’d honestly be all over that. It needs some updates here and there but overall it’s amazing,” another user added. The property was previously featured on the front cover of Popular Science Magazine in February .

It claims itaposs likely to be incredibly popular with professional couples.However, the listing has proved popular online for other reasons.The outdoor area, which is a small, decked area, has been commented on by social media users who found the space to be rather claustrophobic.

He recorded himself hitting out at Washington state Governor Jay Inslee as he lost his job. In the video, Robert says: This is my final sign-off. After  years of serving the citizens of the state of Washington, Iaposm being asked to leave because I am dirty. This is the last time youaposll hear me in a state patrol car. And Jay Inslee can kiss my a**.  He also spoke of how he had worked sick and buried a lot of friends over the past  years of his service to the state. On Friday, Washington State Patrol Chief John R Batiste released a statement saying his former colleague had died. Chief Batiste wrote: I am deeply saddened over the news that our former friend and colleague Trooper Robert LaMay has passed away.  This agencyaposs prayers and remembrances are with his family and loved ones. Rob served honourably for over two decades and we were disappointed to see him leave the agency this past October. His service to this state and agency will be long remembered and appreciated.

But regardless of how you might get engaged, the plan probably wonapost involve your best friend completely ruining the special moment for both you and your partner. Thataposs exactly what happened to one man on Reddit though, who has been left so frustrated with his palaposs actions that heaposs refusing to invite him to his wedding - because he decided to tell the manaposs fiancée exactly what he was planning.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Posting his story anonymously, the man explained his friend has always had a habit of saying things to get reactions out of people, but thought he had grown out of it now that theyaposre adults. He wrote: I and my fiancée have dated for three years. In the last year, we’ve talked about marriage, she’s sent me rings she likes, and all she asked was that I don’t tell her exactly when so she can mostly be surprised. I got her the ring of her dreams and planned a whole weekend in the mountains - which is her favourite place. Her parents and mine travelled to be there but stayed apart from us until after the proposal so she wouldn’t get suspicious. The only people who came with us were a few of our friends so I could call it a friend’s getaway. One of the friends who came with us is my childhood best friend. We’re very close, and he knew the stipulation that my girlfriend did not know when the proposal was going to happen. He also likes to say things to get reactions out of people, and it has caused us the drt apart in the past. I thought he had grown out of this as he has seemed to mellow out.  But about  minutes before he was set to pop the question, the man received a tip-off from another friend that his best mate had already spilt the beans to his partner - and had completely ruined the surprise. After proposing, the man got confirmation from his now-fiancee before confronting his friend, who simply told him heaposd gone against his wishes because it was funny. He added: One of our other friends, who is a photographer, agreed to take the pictures as a gt. She told my fiancée that she just wanted to try out her new camera and wanted her to model for some pictures to see how it worked. About  minutes before we were set to go, our photographer friend came to me and said that my friend had told my fiancée I was going to propose to her. She had heard him tell her and said that my fiancée seemed upset and asked him why he would ruin the surprise.  I didn’t say anything about it to my fiancée until after. She told me that yes, he had told her right before. I went to him and asked why he told her and he said aposbecause it was funnyapos. He wanted to see her reaction and the fact he ruined it for her was funny to him. I told him it was unfair and childish. Now, the man and his partner have decided to uninvite his friend from the wedding, as theyaposre concerned he could do something to ruin their big day too. The man said: I and my fiancée talked about it and we decided to put him on a probation period. Yet, every chance we’ve given him to act better, he doesn’t. He’s only gotten worse - making inappropriate remarks when he visits and asking meI’ll ever get tired of the apossame thing in my bed every nightapos. It’s made me and my fiancée extremely upset. The last time I saw him I told him that he acts jealous of my relationship and that he can’t come to my weddinghe’s going to act like this and possibly ruin our wedding too. That as of right now, I don’t want to see him coming at all or being a part of my le. Commenters on the Reddit post were baffled by the friendaposs actions, as many accused him of ruining things on purpose and encouraged the man to cut him out of his le. One person wrote: He’s ruining things on purpose and you have all the right to cut him out. He sounds toxic, and I wouldn’t doubt ithe ruined your wedding too out of his jealousy. While another said: It’s not playful, it’s spiteful and outright vindictive. He’s trying to hurt people for a reaction and then justying it by saying aposoh it’s funny to hurt people.apos And a third wrote: This is beyond just not inviting. Cut this person and their family out of your le for good. What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.

In fact, they didnapost even say when arriving. The very rude child then demanded lunch and a party bag, the mum was oblivious and today was style same. She continued: Today this sibling who is at least  years older than the birthday child took prizes when not enough for the actual friends of the birthday girl. AIBU, or should I and all parties over cater for everyone to bring siblings  A debate ensued in the comment section as other parents flocked to give their opinions.  One wrote: Extremely rude behaviour. Whoever is hosting should say they canapost stay at that start, wrote another. A third added: I hate this new thing of siblings coming to parties. It p****s me right off. Yes, I understand they might have to be there to drop off and the parent not able to stay for the party but that is preferable that an uninvited guest just coming. Parents wouldnapost do it at any other invite so donapost do it at a kids party. If we wanted siblings there we would state it on the invite. If not donapost go or say you will have to drop and go as you have no childcare for sibling. Donapost just invite whoever you want to someone aposs party. A fourth demanded: Why wouldn’t you just say something to the mum  More fool the people who just allow it. Another penned: I’ve had this too, I ran out of party bags for DC’s friends because of unexpected siblings taking them. Lesson learnt and they are kept hidden until going home time. People still bring siblings without asking. It’s annoying, especially when the activity isn’t suitable for their ages. I now put on the invite a message about no siblings.

Thanks to one woman on TikTok though, you no longer need to suffer from mediocre potatoes, as sheaposs uncovered the secret to nailing deliciously crunchy croquettes every single time - and the process only takes five steps. Montana, who posts under the account @monmackfood, also spoke to the Daily Star about her recipe, which sees her grate her spuds with a cheese grater to achieve a crispy layered result. She said: You want a starchy potato so all the strands of potato stick together and don’t fall apart when you fry them. Itaposs best to get a cheese grater for the job. You technically could dice them really finely with a kne but it’d take ages.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The dish probably takes two to three hours in total including freezing time. In her TikTok video - which went viral and has racked up more than . million views - Montana explained you should start by peeling and grating your potatoes before frying the spud strands in olive oil and salt for around five minutes. She then takes them off the heat, drops them in a glass container lined with cling film, and puts them in the freezer to set - which could take several hours. Once the potatoes have cooled and are solid, Montana says you should remove the frozen block from the container and chop it into small squares - before tossing the square in cornflour.  Then, simply add the potato squares to a pan of hot oil and deep fry for six to seven minutes. Drain the crispy potatoes on some kitchen towel, season with salt, and enjoy the crunchy perfection. Montanaaposs video received over , comments - with many people admitting they couldnapost wait to try out the recipe for themselves. One person wrote: You just made an amazing recipe. Iaposm so trying this! While another said: Mmmm. Honestly, this looks like magic. And a third added: I want to do this so bad. Other commenters were just as keen to ty out the hack but were concerned with the fat content of frying the potatoes in oil as they asked whether the recipe would work in an air fryer.Someone said: These look soooo good. I wonderI could make it with an air fryer  As someone  had the same question, asking: Would this work in an air fryer  Do you have a food story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Grim images and footage have emerged showing strays being ­inhumanely caught and ­transported to remote shelters where it is understood they are left to starve in filthy cages. In other horric cases, some are left to die after being hit by shovels and metal poles. Campaigners are now calling for people in Britain to boycott breaks to Turkey. The brutal government crackdown came after a Christmas Day speech by President Erdogan who demanded city officials round up often beloved stray dogs, which are frequently allowed to roam free in public squares and streets. It came after a pair of Pitbulls attacked and seriously wounded a four-year-old girl in the south.  But it’s thought the dogs were not strays - though some accounts claimed they had been abandoned by their owner. Since then, thousands have taken to the streets to demonstrate, calling for an end to the killings. Zulal Kalkandelen, a journalist and animal liberation activist, said the orders to place the dogs into “prison-like” shelters “effectively means death for the animals”. She added: “In many cases, animals die of hunger and diseases in tiny and filthy cages, while at other times, municipality employees kill them as soon as they collect them from the streets.” Last year, the documentary Stray captured daily le in Istanbul through the eyes of the dogs Zeytin, Nazar and Kartal, who roamed the streets, searching for food and interacting with humans. Animal welfare campaigner Dominic Dyer said: “Municipalities across Turkey are rounding up and killing thousands of stray dogs in what could be one of the largest ­dog genocides in the world. “Street dogs pose little risk to people in Turkey and the most responsible way of controlling their numbers is via neutering, spaying and rehoming. “President Erdogan could pay a very heavy economic price, as thousands of people in Britain and across Europe choose to no longer holiday in Turkey until the round-ups and killing stops.  The Turkish Embassy in London said: “Turkey is one of the leading countries in the protection of animal rights, and legal framework for protection of animals is very robust. “The issue of stray dogs is on the agenda in Turkey as it concerns the safety and health of both animals and iniduals. What is being planned is moving stray dogs in cities to municipal animal shelters, similar to the practice in many other countries. These animals will be looked after in the shelters, as required by related Turkish laws and regulations. “The ongoing process aims to shelter animals in better conditions and in a way that does not threaten public health.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AnimalsAnimal crueltyDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

To date, , people have been killed in fighting between Ukraine forces and pro-Russia separatists. But Kyiv’s iconic Maidan Square, where the ­revolution moving closer to Europe and away from Russia began in late , was business as usual yesterday.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below... Cafes, bars and shops were full of people and there was little sign of civilians readying ­themselves for invasion. Local man Roman Kliuk, , a married father of two, explained: “People are tough and also they tend not to think about what can happenRussia comes. Unless you are from the east or connected to the military in some way you don’t know there is a war as it is so very far away. “Also many Ukrainians here know there is little they can do about the situation, perhaps they cannot afford to stockpile food or flee.  “So they just carry on as usual as they are used to pressure from Russia and the threat from its ­leadership. What  can they do  That’s how they feel. Nobody wants it to happen but they cannot stop it.” Russian tanks could burst across the Belarus border and encircle the capital within days, shelling government buildings, which could also face vicious airstrikes from Russian warplanes. But last night in Kyiv all restaurants, cafes and bars were still open despite that potential threat. Kseniia Polenskiya, a secretary, said: “Nobody knows what will happen so why change how we live  “Many of my friends have discussed leaving and heading west but most have stayed. “It is either because they cannot afford to go or it is impossible to foresee what will happen.

It was confirmed on Monday North Korea had tested a Hwasong- intermediate-range ballistic missile , state media reported.US and South Korean officials warned Sundayaposs launch could lead to resumed testing of long-range weapons and nuclear bombs. It was the seventh conducted by North Korea this month and the first time a nuclear-capable missile of that size had been launched since . The launch was first reported by South Korean and Japanese authorities on Sunday, who condemned it as a threat to regional security.  The inspection firing test was conducted for the purpose of selectively inspecting the ground-to-ground mid-range long-range ballistic missile Hwasong- and verying the overall accuracy of this weapon system, North Korean state news agency KCNA said. North Korea has previously said the Hwasong- can carry a large-size heavy nuclear warhead”. KCNA said the missile launch was conducted in such a way as to ensure the safety of neighbouring countries, and that the test warhead was fitted with a camera that took photos while it was in space.  Photos released by state media showed space-based images of North Korea and the surrounding areas through a round camera lens. North Korea first took such photos in , analysts said. Leader Kim Jong-un was not reported to have attended the test, which was at least the seventh launch in January, one of the busiest ever for North Koreaaposs advancing missile programme. On Sunday South Korean President Moon Jae-in said the launch takes North Korea a step closer to fully scrapping a self-imposed moratorium on testing its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles . Kim has said he is no longer bound by that moratorium, which included a stop to nuclear weapons tests and was announced in  amid a flurry of diplomacy and summits with then-U.S. President Donald Trump.North Korea suggested this month it could restart those testing activities because the United States and its allies had shown no sign of dropping their hostile policies”. The US shares the concerns that North Koreaaposs escalating missile tests could be precursors to resumed tests of nuclear weapons and ICBMs, a senior US official said on Sunday night, while urging Pyongyang to join direct talks with no preconditions. They are looking to take actions, which we believe are fundamentally destabilising, as a way to increase pressure, the official told a briefing of journalists in Washington.  I think that there probably is a component that is also to validate the systems that theyaposve developed and further refine them. It is unclearIRBMs such as the Hwasong- were included in Kimaposs moratorium, but those, too, have not been tested since . That year North Korea flight-tested the Hwasong- at least six times, achieving three successful flights and three failures. Controversially, in two of those tests North Korea launched the missile over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. In Sundayaposs test, North Korea said it fired the missile on an elevated trajectory in consideration of the safety of neighbouring countries”. The test confirmed the accuracy, safety, and operational effectiveness of the produced Hwasong- type weapon system, KCNA said. The Hwasong- has an estimated range of , kilometres , which would put the US territory of Guam and the far western tip of Alaskaaposs Aleutian Islands chain within reach, according to the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies . By comparison, the largest, most powerful missile North Korea has tested to date is the Hwasong- ICBM, with an estimated range of ,-, km, which could threaten anywhere in the United States, CSIS said. The Hwasong- was tested once, in November .

She added that some head teachers would also be expected to retire within the transition period.#Job sizing will be criticalthe proposals are to be implemented,# Ms Connor said.Council documents explain that the process of job sizing takes into account the size of schools, leadership roles and teaching time when deciding on the salary scale for promoted posts in education.#Head teachers retiring would also form part of the modelling,# Ms Connor added. #If a school collective was agreed where there were, for example, seven head teachers then two might be retiring and that would form part of the model.#Until collectives are looked at in more detail we can#t have a clear idea of staff numbers.#As part of the consultation process, which started in November and is due to finish on March , the council has shared its proposals with parent groups and community councils.Feedback from the consultation is timetabled to be presented to Argyll and Bute Council in April.This will be followed by the proposals being voted on towards the end of  and,approved, interim processes to bring in the changes would begin in spring .At Tuesday#s meeting it was explained, however, that the consultation will continue throughout the process with pupils, parents and educators being included in the process throughout.In addition, dialogue is continuing with the Roman Catholic Diocese of Argyll and the Isles concerning the involvement of faith schools in school collectives.These discussions were described by council officers as #ongoing# and #collaborative#.Concerns were also raised about the timing of the proposed changes, coming when pupils# education and wellbeing had been impacted by the pandemic.Acting Head of Education Learning and Teaching Wendy Brownlie said: #Young people#s views have been gathered throughout and they have expressed really interesting points both for and against the changes.#The consultation paper addresses the issue of the pandemic by saying: #The last couple of years have been extraordinarily challenging for schools.

And now. after two years they have recruited over  participants from  sites across the UK.Prior to the launch of MND-SMART, only three of the sites had run clinical trials in MND in the last decade.MND-SMART is designed to test more than one drug at the same time and be adaptive so that researchers can mody their approach according to emerging results. The trial has so far been testing two active drugs and more drugs will be added, in due course, while medicines that prove ineffective will be dropped.Dr Suvankar Pal, Euan MacDonald Centre for MND Research, University of Edinburgh and Co-lead Investigator of MND-SMART, said, “Historically, you would have a two-armed trial that looks at one active drug against a placebo [dummy drug], but this trial design allows us to test many, many more active drugs simultaneously and therefore get a definitive answer [phase ] more quickly, which is a much more efficient way of doing things.”Doddie’s Foundation has a clear vision of a world free of motor neuron disease and was founded in response to his frustration at the lack of options given to MND patients – no effective treatment, no access to meaningful clinical trials and no hope.The aims of the Foundation are to raise funds to aid research into the causes of MND and investigate potential cures and to make grants to iniduals suffering from MND, to enable them to live as fulfilled a le as possible.Olivia Bird, Research and Grants Officer at My Name’ Doddie Foundation, said, “We are delighted to continue our involvement in this landmark trial in MND and it is brilliant to see what progress has been made, despite the challenges of working around a pandemic.“We are incredibly grateful to the trial teams across the UK who have shown commitment and enthusiasm to get the trial up and running, and to our supporters who have gone to extraordinary s to raise much needed funds.”.removeA £, grant was also awarded to Newcastle NHS Foundation Trust to facilitate recruitment of patients in the northeast of England."},{"url":null,"title":"highway-code-changes-make-roads-safer-says-cycling-scotland","story":"CHANGES to the Highway Code have been welcomed by Cycling Scotland, the nation’s cycling organisation.The changes come into effect today and will impact all road users but will have the overall goal of making roads safer for people on foot, bikes and horses.Around , people took part in a consultation, with the UK government saying that most people who responded were in favour of the proposed changes.The change in rules will see users who are most at risk moved to the top of the hierarchy and enforces the idea that motorists need to be more aware of cyclists, and cyclists need to be more aware of pedestrians.Among the many changes, cyclists are advised to ride in the centre of a lane on quieter roads, in slower-moving traffic, and when approaching junctions to make themselves as visible as possible.They can ride two abreast, as is already the case but must allow drivers behind them to overtakeit is safe to do so.Other key amendments include clearer guidance for drivers to leave a distance of at least . metres when overtaking cyclists, and there will also be a recommendation for car occupants to open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder behind them.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opening into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Drivers and motorcyclists should now give priority to cyclists on roundabouts. The guidance will say they should not attempt to overtake people cycling within that person’s lane and should allow people cycling to move across their path as they travel around the roundabout.Cyclists will still be able to remain in the left-hand lane when going across or around a roundabout.

We encourage everyone to read the new guidance and follow it, whether you’re walking or wheeling, riding a bike or horse or driving a vehicle.“While good progress has been on road safety overall in the last decade, sadly still too many people are killed or seriously injured while walking or cycling”All road users are urged to study the new rules."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-mps-david-mundell-john-lamont-expenses-revealed","story":"THE two Borders MPs cost the taxpayer around £, last year, new figures reveal.Data on business and staffing costs for the financial year   has been published by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority .And the figures show that Tweeddale representative David Mundell was the fourth most expensive MP in the UK, claiming £,. – up from £,. last year.Mr Mundell, of the Conservatives, spent around £, on staff wages, approximately £, on rent, and around £, on advertising and contact cards, according to the data.Meanwhile, he paid out more than £, on air travel, around £, on stationery and printing, and approximately £, on a working from home allowance.:Fears that new supermarket would hurt Galashiels laughable, says councillorIn response to the figures, Mr Mundell said: “The constituency I represent is one of the largest and most erse in the whole United Kingdom, stretching from the Scottish border to the Pentland Hills south of Edinburgh, and covering three separate council areas and three separate NHS health boards.“I try at all times to provide the best possible service to my constituents across the more than  inidual communities which make up my constituency and this necessarily involves a level of expenditure that other MPs, representing smaller, less complex constituencies, are not required to incur.”The Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale MP added: “COVID has made this all the more challenging, including expenditure on local newspaper advertising to help ensure constituents and businesses who have queries about how COVID regulations impact them, or how grants or other forms of support can be accessed, had my office contact details easily to hand.”:Police tasked to target inappropriate and dangerous parking in Borders townAccording to the IPSA data, the average cost of an MP in the UK was £,..removeThe figures show that fellow Westminster representative for the region John Lamont claimed £,. in  .Mr Lamont’s largest type of cost was around £, on staff wages, followed by £, on rent and £, on bought-in services.Meanwhile, the Conservative MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk spent approximately £, on advertising and contact cards, just under £, on air travel and around £, on a working from home allowance.Mr Lamont’s costs were up on the £,. recorded the year before.:Police appeal for information following reports of graffiti in SelkirkOn the data, he said: “During the last year, we have seen an unprecedented  per cent increase in the number of enquiries and requests for help from local residents.

honour the traditional Scots dish with a rendition of one of Robert Burns’ most famous and oft-performed poems: Address To a Haggis.Usually recited by the dinners host, the tongue-in-cheek address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.What is the history of an Address to a Haggis The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas given give her weekly Covid update in parliament today.The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iantwere removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should

The parking within that area is really under pressure.“To put another development without additional parking at the back would have made it dangerous for the people living there.”: Subscribe to the East Lothian Courier for FREE... but offer ends on Monday!Pippa Swan, chairwoman of Dunbar Community Council, was keen to ensure the building had a future.She was “surprised” by the decision but added that the reasons for refusal were “well rehearsed”.She said: “Everybody is supportive of development and any development has got to be respectful of the shape of the Assembly Rooms.”"},{"url":null,"title":"sustaining-north-berwick-welcomes-new-members","story":"The community group looks at sustainable, ecological living on a local level, and is part of the nationwide Climate Cafe movement.Member Ruth Hunter-Pepper highlighted the group’s successful COP meet on the beach last November, and spoke of plans for a March event, which will feature businesses and organisations such as energy companies and environmental charities, and provide advice and guidance on ecological living to visitors.: Subscribe to the East Lothian Courier for FREE... but offer ends on Monday!Member Kathy Duncan also spoke about the group’s tree-planting programme and her work to help create a wildle garden ‘trail’ through the town.Ruth also expressed her gratitude to the Seabird Centre for the use of its cafe, and a hope that the two organisations could work together in future on local sustainability projects."},{"url":null,"title":"last-chance-subscribe-free-thirty-days","story":"The East Lothian Courier team want to bring you consistent exclusive coverage of our one-of-a-kind area.  In order to continuously deliver that, we need your support.

address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iant were removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

for a \"phasedfrom the office\" to a \"hybrid working model\".This means that you can work some time in the office and work sometimes at home rather than a full .Nicola Sturgeon has said a requirement for two-metre physical distancing in settings where face coverings are exempt is being reduced to one metre.The change will apply to settings such as religious services and those carrying out receptionist duties.Updating MSPs, the First Minister also announced a change affecting organised activities for children.She said: “From Friday, face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities when they are directly interacting with children under the age of five.”Scotlands international travel rules have been brought in line with the rest of the UK. From February , vaccinated travellers will no longer need to take a PCR test when they arrive back in Scotland. However, vaccinated travellers will need to fill in a passenger locator form.Unvaccinated travellers will need to take a pre-departure test two days before travelling and two days after they arrive back in Scotland. Currently, the international \" fully vaccinated\" definition includes two doses of the Covid vaccine and not the booster dose. However, this is being kept under review. Ms Sturgeon warned that travel restrictions could be reintroduced in light of a new iant so this is constantly being monitored. Ms Sturgeon has been facing renewed calls to remove the requirement for mask-wearing in Scottish schools.Masks are no longer needed in English secondary schools with the requirement being dropped from Thursday  January.Face coverings will no longer need to be worn by adults who are leading activities in childcare and early learning settings with children under  years old. Mask wearing restrictions will be changing in schools due to the increase in cases for this age group but the advice will be kept under \"close and regular review\".The First Minister was expected to outline a strategic framework or  roadmap to move the country to a “less restrictive” society.Ms Strugeon has confirmed that a full outline will be available in the coming weeks. Nicola Sturgeon has encouraged Scots to take note of the Scottish Government’s Distance Aware scheme.The First Minister said badges and lanyards with the Distance Aware logo, indicating the wearer would like extra space, would be available to anyone who wants one.She said: “Soyou or anyone you know is worried about being out and about and would feel safer with a bit more space, please get a Distance Aware badge.“And for everyone ,you see someone wearing the badge or lanyard, give them the space and consideration that they are asking for.”Nicola Sturgeon also updated the Scottish parliament over the latest Covid cases. While the First Minister said that cases remain high, we are starting to see a \"broadly positive picture\"., new cases of COVID- reported have been reported as well as  new reported deaths of people who have tested positiveThere were  people in intensive care on Monday, January  with recently confirmed COVID- and , people were in hospital

and pedestrians risk failing to boost safety due to not being widely promoted, campaigners have warned.Charity Cycling UK said that a “long-term and well-funded communications campaign” is needed to make people aware of the update.The Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, is being amended this weekend to introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.Here’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip hazard from trailing cables."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12800707.jpg?type=article-full","title":"runs-scotland-investigation-scotlands-corridors-power-full","story":"Our subscribers will get

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant.

Even so, there still seems to be some uncertainty about whether or not this date is set in stone. Meanwhile, there are many questions that remain unanswered about how the scheme will work in practice. #That is particular the case in our islands, where national schemes often fail to recognise local circumstances. That is why I felt it was important to bring together local stakeholders in Orkney and provide them with an opportunity to raise any questions or concerns with Circularity Scotland, the body responsible for overseeing the rollout of DRS.#I would also encourage any local business or community group with an interest in this issue to get in touch with me.#We have seen from the experience of other countries how such schemes can deliver real benefits in terms of reducing waste, litter and emissions.

We need to be careful that the national messaging, which currently sits well within larger city areas, does not impact negatively here.“The simple solution is for everyone to maintain the good practices in place that have kept many of us safe to this point. They include the wearing of masks, distancing, sanitising and keeping up the regular lateral flow testing and logging the results online whether positive or negative which help our colleagues in Public Health keep on top of potential community transmission.”The Scottish Government has announced new guidance on working from home will come into effect on Monday, January .This will recommend that employers consider a hybrid working system, with staff spending some time in the office and some time at home.Businesses had previously been asked to enable staff to work from home where possible.The requirement for physical distancing in settings where certain people are exempt from wearing face coverings # like those leading religious services or carrying out some receptionist duties # will be reduced from m to m from January .Face coverings will no longer be required for any adult taking part in organised activities with children under the age of five.OLECG vice-chair and the council’s interim executive director of environmental, property  IT services, Hayley Green, said: “Our business continuity plans are holding up but there remains a fragility and we do not want to react in a manner that could potentially risk services, particularly frontline essential services, by implementing change too quickly # we must maintain a steady as we go approach.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up.

He always has huge belief in himself but, after fearing a month and a half ago that a chronic foot problem might end his career, he certainly did not expect to be walking away with a title he had not won since . That he did so from two sets down against a man who may soon be world number one made it all the more remarkable.The greatest of all time debate has raged ever since first Nadal and then Djokovic began to close in on Federer’s records. The grand slam tally is seen as the most important one but it is far from the only metric, and the others mostly favour Djokovic. He is starting his th week on top of the rankings compared to  for Federer and  for Nadal. Djokovic has also won all the ATP Masters tournaments at least twice and leads both Nadal and Federer in head-to-head records. He is also a year younger than Nadal. vw,vw,px, px\"Novak Djokovic was deported from Australia We will never knowDjokovic would have made it  titles in Melbourne had he not been deported – a sentence that still seems extraordinary to write. His record at the tournament, including two final victories over Nadal, would certainly have made him a big favourite.A post shared by Rafa Nadal This incredible feat can surely only boost the -year-old for the season ahead and the years to come. He proved he can still physically match and better players a decade his junior and he will want to regain the French Open title from Djokovic and win a th crown in Paris. If he could reach  with the others still on , it would be a signicant gap.Congratulations to @RafaelNadal for st GS. Amazing achievement. Always impressive fighting spirit that prevailed another time. Enhorabuena 👏🏆👍 @Medwed gave it his all out there and played with the passion and determination we have come to expect from him. pic DsOvKidNc— Novak DjokovicJanuary , That will be the key question in tennis over the next few months. If restrictions stay the same and he continues to refuse to be vaccinated against Covid-, then he will find his options limited. As it stands, he is unlikely to be able to play the big ATP tournaments in Indian Wells and Miami as well as the French Open. There is a realistic scenario whereby Wimbledon is his next major tournament, although the situation could change signicantly in the coming months. Federer, meanwhile, continues to recover from knee surgery.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Of course I am proud. The personal satisfaction is higher than years ago. I think I just stay more in the moment without thinking so far in front.” vw,vw,px, px\"Rafael Nadal celebrates his win over Daniil Medvedev The triumph brought Nadal a record st grand slam title, nudging him ahead of Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic in the race to top men’s tennis, and with the chance for  at the French Open in the spring.His priority for now will be to let his body recover before he s to tour action. His next event is scheduled to be the ATP tournament in Acapulco at the end of February prior to the big Masters events in Indian Wells and Miami.“I don’t know what can happen on clay or not,” said Nadal, who will look to regain the Roland Garros title from Djokovic.“I have hopefully some events before clay. Just enjoying these moments, hope to share with the family this unforgettable moment, then I’m going to think what’s next for me.”It was not a dream‼️ 😍🏆Good morning evryone‼️ pic ikCBLBkgm— Rafa Nadal Academy by MovistarJanuary , The big question over the next few months will be how often Djokovic is able to playhe remains unvaccinated. Having been so close to  himself at the US Open last year, the Serbian could find himself two behind Nadal heading into Wimbledon.Eurosport pundit John McEnroe said: “What I wanted was that they all end up with the same number. It’s OKthey are all at  and it’s OKthey are all at .“I think it’s doubtful that Roger’s going to win another one. How much is he going to play  But, then again, we didn’t expect Rafa to do that here. With Novak, everything’s up in the air at the moment, especiallyhe’s not playing in the French. The next thing you know, Rafa is going to have .”Medvedev was left licking his wounds after failing to take his chances in the third set and seeing Nadal turn the match around.The Russian was most upset, though, about the behaviour of the crowd towards him and began his press conference afterwards with a monologue saying his childhood dream had died.It was surely at least partly disappointment talking and, having appeared to delight in playing the role of villain, Medvedev must accept that he has made himself a isive figure.What is not in doubt, though, is the talent of the -year-old, who played superbly for two and a half sets before his body and mind became fatigued.He could soon overtake Djokovic to become world number one, and he said: “Talking about tennis, I have not much regrets. I’m going to try to continue my best. I’m going to work even harder to try to be a champion of some of these great tournaments one day.”Medvedev even raised the possibility of not playing in grand slams, but Nadal told Channel Nine: “I think he will. Of course it’s tough after a match like this. I had huge support of the crowd and it was tough for Daniil, I felt sorry for him. It just takes a little bit of time.“I really believe and hope that he will have these amazing feelings in the future because he’s going to be a great champion and the people are going to understand how good he is and are going to understand a little bit better his personality. I’m sure he’s going to have the crowd supporting him soon.”We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Late results could come in on Monday.Socialist leader Antonio Costa, who is expected toto his post as prime minister, immediately offered an olive branch to his adversaries.He said he would encourage alliances with other parties in parliament to overcome the country’s pandemic-inspired economic dficulties.“The mission is to turn the page on the pandemic and bring affected sectors back to le,” Mr Costa said in a victory speech.The stakes are high for the next administration. vw,vw,px, px\"Andre Ventura, leader of the populist party Chega!Portugal, a country of . million people and the poorest in western Europe, is poised to begin deploying  billion euroof aid as a member of the EU to help spur the economy after the pandemic.Two-thirds of that sum is intended for public projects, such as major infrastructure, giving the next government a financial bonanza. The other third is to be awarded to private companies.A parliamentary majority would smooth the next government’s path in allocating those funds in a country whose economy has struggled to gain traction since the turn of the century.The past two Socialist administrations were minority governments. Since coming to power in , the Socialist Party relied on the support of smaller allies in parliament – the Left Bloc and thePortuguese Communist Party – to ensure the annual state budget had enough votes to pass.But two months ago their dferences, especially over public health spending and workers’ rights, were insurmountable, leaving Mr Costa short of votes in parliament to pass his party’s plan and triggering a snap election. vw,vw,px, px\"It is not yet clearMr Costa’s party will have enough seats for a majority in parliament Mr Costa may need to forge another cross-party alliance in a fragmented parliament.Some . million voters – . million of them living abroad – were eligible to choose legislators in the Republican Assembly, Portugal’s parliament, where political parties then decide who forms a government.Chega! , a populist and nationalist party founded less than three years ago, collected around % of the vote. That might give it a dozen MPs, up from only one in the last parliament.The Left Bloc captured some % of the vote, with about the same going to the Portuguese Communist Party. Other smaller parties could get one or more parliamentary seats and offer Mr Costa their support.Portugal’s economy needs a shot in the arm, which the EU funds may provide.The country has been falling behind the rest of the -nation EU since , when its real annual gross domestic product per capita was , eurocompared with an EU average of , euro . By , Portugal had edged higher to , eurowhile the bloc’s average surged to , euro .The Socialists promised to increase the minimum monthly wage, earned by more than , people, to  euroby .

Late results could come in on Monday.Socialist leader Antonio Costa, who is expected toto his post as prime minister, immediately offered an olive branch to his adversaries.He said he would encourage alliances with other parties in parliament to overcome the country’s pandemic-inspired economic dficulties.“The mission is to turn the page on the pandemic and bring affected sectors back to le,” Mr Costa said in a victory speech.The stakes are high for the next administration. vw,vw,px, px\"Andre Ventura, leader of the populist party Chega!Portugal, a country of . million people and the poorest in western Europe, is poised to begin deploying  billion euroof aid as a member of the EU to help spur the economy after the pandemic.Two-thirds of that sum is intended for public projects, such as major infrastructure, giving the next government a financial bonanza. The other third is to be awarded to private companies.A parliamentary majority would smooth the next government’s path in allocating those funds in a country whose economy has struggled to gain traction since the turn of the century.The past two Socialist administrations were minority governments. Since coming to power in , the Socialist Party relied on the support of smaller allies in parliament – the Left Bloc and thePortuguese Communist Party – to ensure the annual state budget had enough votes to pass.But two months ago their dferences, especially over public health spending and workers’ rights, were insurmountable, leaving Mr Costa short of votes in parliament to pass his party’s plan and triggering a snap election. vw,vw,px, px\"It is not yet clearMr Costa’s party will have enough seats for a majority in parliament Mr Costa may need to forge another cross-party alliance in a fragmented parliament.Some . million voters – . million of them living abroad – were eligible to choose legislators in the Republican Assembly, Portugal’s parliament, where political parties then decide who forms a government.Chega! , a populist and nationalist party founded less than three years ago, collected around % of the vote. That might give it a dozen MPs, up from only one in the last parliament.The Left Bloc captured some % of the vote, with about the same going to the Portuguese Communist Party. Other smaller parties could get one or more parliamentary seats and offer Mr Costa their support.Portugal’s economy needs a shot in the arm, which the EU funds may provide.The country has been falling behind the rest of the -nation EU since , when its real annual gross domestic product per capita was , eurocompared with an EU average of , euro . By , Portugal had edged higher to , eurowhile the bloc’s average surged to , euro .The Socialists promised to increase the minimum monthly wage, earned by more than , people, to  euroby .

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

Credit: Stephen DavisonAlf McCrearyEmailJanuary   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe congregation of Windsor Presbyterian walked in a pilgrimage after their final service on Sunday morning to their new home at Great Victoria Street. They did so with a mixture of sadness but also with hope that great things will develop in their Christian mission nearer the city centre.The Windsor congregation has been forced to leave its beautul late th century building on the Lisburn Road because it cannot pay for the expensive refurbishment of its stonework, dating from . However, the building will be developed as an arts and drama centre by supporters aiming to raise the finance required.The Windsor Church was virtually full for its last service and the large congregation included many current and former members, and former ministers and well-wishers from neighbouring churches.The music was inspiring with much-loved hymns familiar to generations of worshippers, and some people wondered what will happen to the splendid organ which featured for the last time at Windsor in Presbyterian worship. Perhaps it will be used by the new artistic owners.Father Eddie O’Donnell brought best wishes from St. Brigid’s Catholic Church at the other end of Derryvolgie Avenue, as did Mark Houston from the nearby Windsor Baptist Church which moved relatively recently into the old Majestic Cinema on the Lisburn Road.He said “We know how you may be feeling. There will be challenges ahead, but God will be with you.”The Windsor minister the Reverend Ivan Steen preached on the Gospel theme of “new wine in new wineskins”. He said: “The Christian Church and the people of God cannot stand still. Our departure from this building and our pilgrimage to Great Victoria Street is a visual representation of the Christian le on the move.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The Presbyterian Moderator, the Right Reverend Dr David Bruce said: “Places, including buildings, are important to us, because this is where memories are made. It is likely the things we remember best are connected with places, buildings, gardens and rooms.“We are all on a journey and the landscape continually changes. For Windsor that landscape has changed and accelerated, but as you move on you are being a tutor to others throughout the Presbyterian Church who face the challenges of radical change.”The service which ended with the familiar hymn “Be Thou My Vision” to the traditional Irish melody of Slane was also presented in sign language to cater for the Kinghan Mission for the Deaf which has close connections with the Windsor Church.There were also translations in the Persian language by Hassan Sabahi, a chef who came to Belfast six years ago from Iran. He said: “I have felt at home in Windsor where I was given adult baptism. I am always very happy to help with the service in the Persian language. My fiancée Mina is still living in Iran but we are working to try to ensure that she will join me here within the next few months.”The Windsor congregation includes a number of refugees and asylum seekers. A young Mongolian woman Demi Mijiddorj Tenuun was at Sunday’s service with her son Tumurchuder . She was a laboratory chemist in Mongolia and came to Belfast six years ago. She said: “When I came I spoke no English and had no family, but the people of Windsor Church became my wider family. If I had to leave this church on my own I would be sad, but I am leaving with my Windsor family and I am leaving with hope for the future.”Norma Dawson, an Emeritus Professor at Queen’s University, has been a Windsor elder for over  years. She said: “Today is bittersweet. I am sad at leaving but I am also grateful that the people of Great Victoria Street Church are being so warm and welcoming to us.”Cecil Graham, an elder for over  years, said: “I will also be sad at leaving but the move to Great Victoria Street will provide a greater base for outreach nearer the city centre”The congregation included Tom Hartley, a former Sinn Fein Councillor and Lord Mayor of Belfast who has a special interest in Presbyterian Churches. It is estimated that  of these in Belfast have closed since .A former Presbyterian Moderator, the Very Reverend Dr John Dunlop who was also at the service, said: “It is a sad day because Windsor is closing. It is such a beautul building on a great site, but it is also a positive move which will provide a place of worship and of meeting from many immigrants and asylum seekers from all parts of the city.”The Reverend Steen added: “We are also near the Kinghan Mission in Botanic Avenue which is now the most international part of the city.”At the Great Victoria Street Church later on there was joy and celebration as people from both congregations shared a barbecue and light refreshments,The minister, the Reverend William Harkness, said: “I am very excited. This feels just right and we welcome the Windsor people with open arms, like two parts coming together.”Most ReadIan Paisley gives we Fiona a £k pay rise for part-time jobOusted Jim Wells fears he will have to sell home to pay for we’s careIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverThe cruel sextortion seductress whose plot led to victim’s suicideTop VideosPlayJohn Travolta makes horric attempt at Irish accent as he lands in ShannonPlayHundreds attend commemoration event to mark th anniversary of Bloody SundayPlayDoug Beattie describes Bloody Sunday as ‘unjustied’Latest Northern IrelandGetting balance was key in Kieran McGeeney’s plan to topple mighty DublinCrusaders boss Stephen Baxter hit with a six-game banIt’s RBAI next for Sullivan after they storm into quarter-finalsPublic urged to help combat rising hate crime attacks in Northern IrelandStaffing crisis in agri-food industry is down to immigration rules, Poots toldLatestPregnant reporter fights New Zealand’s government to come home from KabulFatal stabbings during altercation an ‘isolated incident’Manchester United player Mason Greenwood arrested over alleged rape and assaultRyanair misses target in December as Omicron hits air trafficGetting balance was key in Kieran McGeeney’s plan to topple mighty Dublin,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We firmly believe that these new laws will protect children’s health,” she said. We have already protected adults in workplaces and public places from second-hand smoke and it’s high time we gave our young people the same protection. It’ll also reduce their perception that smoking is normal behaviour. We know that children who regularly see adults smoke are more likely to try smoking.”It became illegal to smoke in any pub, restaurant, nightclub, and most workplaces and work vehicles, in Northern Ireland and across the UK in .The latest ban follows other measures to steer young people in Northern Ireland away from smoking in recent years.These include the ban of tobacco sales in vending machines the ban of tobacco displays in shops tougher sanctions on retailers caught selling tobacco to children standardised packaging and a ban on selling cigarettes in packs of ten.Ms Thompson also noted that “most e-cigarettes contain nicotine and nicotine is highly addictive, so it makes sense to limit access to e-cigarettes for under s”.There are concerns that young people who start vaping and become addicted to nicotine, may also become tobacco smokers, so we see this legislation working not only to reduce usage of e-cigarettes among young people, but potentially reduce the number of young people who ultimately take up smoking,” the charity worker continued.She said there are currently , deaths caused by tobacco in Northern Ireland every year, along with thousands affected by cancer, respiratory and other smoking related illnesses.Most ReadIan Paisley gives we Fiona a £k pay rise for part-time jobOusted Jim Wells fears he will have to sell home to pay for we’s careIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverThe cruel sextortion seductress whose plot led to victim’s suicideTop VideosPlayHundreds attend commemoration event to mark th anniversary of Bloody SundayPlayDoug Beattie describes Bloody Sunday as ‘unjustied’PlayStorm Corrie set to bring mph gusts as , remain without power following Storm MalikLatest Northern IrelandGetting balance was key in Kieran McGeeney’s plan to topple mighty DublinCrusaders boss Stephen Baxter hit with a six-game banIt’s RBAI next for Sullivan after they storm into quarter-finalsPublic urged to help combat rising hate crime attacks in Northern IrelandStaffing crisis in agri-food industry is down to immigration rules, Poots toldLatestFatal stabbings during altercation an ‘isolated incident’Manchester United player Mason Greenwood arrested over alleged rape and assaultRyanair misses target in December as Omicron hits air trafficGetting balance was key in Kieran McGeeney’s plan to topple mighty DublinWeekend Takeaway:  things we learned from a dramatic set of games in the Irish Premiership,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mining, drilling and fracking risks the destruction of our environment through contributing to our already high emissions, and polluting our water further,” she said.“The five-party Executive must step up to represent the community, by supporting the anti-mining campaign and ensure that mining and fossil fuel extraction come to an end.“I have tabled an amendment in the Assembly to introduce a legislative ban on the exploration and extraction of fossil fuels in Northern Ireland.“Fracking is a dangerous and environmentally harmful practice, which should have no place in Northern Ireland as we make a just transition to a net-zero future.”People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll added: “There are clearly mixed messages and policy coming from the Stormont Executive in relation to climate change. “On the one hand the Executive makes occasional good soundings about climate change but then continually implements policies that specically destroy the environment.“This is a clear example of that in practice. “There is countless evidence of the harm and environmental damage committed by the extractive industry, yet the minister has ignored those warnings and allowed millions to go directly into the coffers of extractive companies.”Invest NI said: “An experienced Invest NI assessment  considers all aspects of a project against Invest NI’s intervention principles and the assessment process is rigorous. In addition, applications are assessed on the basis of the level of innovation, the potential for commercialisation and the economic impact of the project.”The Department for the Economy said it is undertaking a review of both minerals and petroleum licensing policies to ensure that the regimes remain fit for purpose.“As regards oil and gas, independent research has been undertaken to consider the environmental, social and economic impacts of onshore petroleum exploration and production in Northern Ireland,” the department said.“Informed by this research and other relevant international studies, a range of policy options for the future of the petroleum licensing system are being considered. “Given the controversial and cross cutting nature of this topic the options will be presented to the Executive. “The minister hopes to bring options to the Executive soon for agreement of a preferred policy option which will then be subject to public consultation.”The department said the review of minerals licensing is being taken forward separately to that for oil and gas and research is being undertaken into the economic, societal and environmental impacts of mineral exploration and mining in Northern Ireland.

The CEO’s salary is set by the remuneration and performance committee which is made up of three members of the board, known as the Council. All of our board members are volunteers.”Unicef Ireland’s director, Peter Power, has an annual salary of €, , while St Vincent de Paul’s national director , Andy Heffernan, brings home between €, and €, Agnes Lunny is the chief executive of learning disability charity Positive Futures, based in Northern Ireland, and Positive Futures Ireland, based in the Republic.Her combined salary for both roles is £, annually.In her response to this newspaper request, Ms Lunny said: “My average working week across both roles is + hours, more often than not  hours. That puts my hourly pay at between £ and £.“My salary was recently increased following a benchmarking exercise against similar roles in Health  Social Care.”All-Ireland wellbeing charity Inspire’s chief executive, Kerry Anthony, has an annual salary of between £, and £,. An Inspire spokesperson said: “You will see from our accounts that our income mostly comes from contracts for services with very little coming from donations from the public. Any donations we do get from the public to support our work go straight to the projects for which they are raised and don’t contribute to the pay of our CEO.”Ulster Unionist MLA Andy Allen, a member of Stormont’s Communities Committee, said he can understand why some may be concerned by charity bosses taking in large salaries, however the signicant amount of work they undertake must be taken into account.“The structure and complexity of modern charities require leadership and ability at the highest levels to ensure the organisation is managed effectively to deliver vital support services for their beneficiaries,” he said.“While I understand fully the public concern that salaries of some charity chief executives are over £,, it is important to recognise the experience and skills required to run an organisation that employs hundreds of people, manages millions of pounds of public money and donations — delivering vital services to our most needy and vulnerable.If an inidual could earn more in a similar position in the private sector, as is the case in many of these examples, then how can our charities attract the best and most qualied leaders to ensure services to those most in need are deliveredthey are not offering a comparable salary that recognises the skills and experience needed ”In December , it emerged that the then-Communities Minister Caral Ni Chuilin had commissioned an independent review of the Charity Commission, following a report by senior civil servant Jonathan Baume looking at how the Department for Communities handled complaints in relation to the Commission.Responding to an Assembly question about the Baume report’s recommendations by TUV leader Jim Allister at the time, Ms Ni Chuilin said: “The former Head of the Civil Servicecommissioned a review into how the Department for Communities had handled a number of complaints from a member of the public in relation to the Charity Commission.“HOCS asked my Department to respond to the suggestions set out in the review. These are currently being progressed, including consideration of the Department’s role as the custodian of charity regulation law and policy and sponsor for the Commission.“The Department’s Head of Governance has also written to the Chief Commissioner to seek assurances in relation to matters highlighted in the Review.“In order to restore public confidence in a system that has undoubtedly been damaged, I have also decided to commission an independent review of charity regulation including a review of the performance of the Charity Commission in its role as statutory regulator.”Related topicsAndy AllenJim AllisterDepartment for CommunitiesMore On Andy Allen PremiumShock figures show  died while waiting for place to call home last year PremiumDurkan ‘shocked’ that Stormont minister ed almost £m in funding PremiumQuestions raised after Justice Department s £m to Finance Department as PSNI faces budget shortfall PremiumHousing Executive owns more than  acres of unused land while, people on homes waiting listHargey wants £m aid for homes hit by energy costsMost ReadIan Paisley gives we Fiona a £k pay rise for part-time jobOusted Jim Wells fears he will have to sell home to pay for we’s careIn Pictures: Bloody Sunday... images from the BelfastarchivesRarely-seen Bloody Sunday pictures: Twelve minutes that changed Derry foreverThe cruel sextortion seductress whose plot led to victim’s suicideTop VideosPlayHundreds attend commemoration event to mark th anniversary of Bloody SundayPlayDoug Beattie describes Bloody Sunday as ‘unjustied’PlayStorm Corrie set to bring mph gusts as , remain without power following Storm MalikLatest Northern IrelandGetting balance was key in Kieran McGeeney’s plan to topple mighty DublinCrusaders boss Stephen Baxter hit with a six-game banIt’s RBAI next for Sullivan after they storm into quarter-finalsPublic urged to help combat rising hate crime attacks in Northern IrelandStaffing crisis in agri-food industry is down to immigration rules, Poots toldLatestFatal stabbings during altercation an ‘isolated incident’Manchester United player Mason Greenwood arrested over alleged rape and assaultRyanair misses target in December as Omicron hits air trafficGetting balance was key in Kieran McGeeney’s plan to topple mighty DublinWeekend Takeaway:  things we learned from a dramatic set of games in the Irish Premiership,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in . It took over the vacant Albion clothing factory on the Antrim Road and at one point last year was employing  people.The number has been whittled away and will be reduced to  employees.The other two major employers have also been hit over the last four years. The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success. Surveys have shown more people go racing on a Sunday than on any other day, he remarked.ldquoYet the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture last November rejected the appeals of deputations representation Downpatrick and Down Royal seeking an equal opportunity.Mr Duff said thatSunday racing is permitted, the law relating to gambling would have to be changed.Mr Duff added: ldquoEverybody in racing respects the views of people who may be against Sunday racing, but I donrsquot think they should be allowed to dictate to the majority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Matt.jpg","title":"Matthew survives on Dancing With The Stars  ","story":"LOVE Islander Matthew MacNabb survived the first public vote in RTErsquos Dancing With The Stars mdash despite gaining the lowest number of points.The Downpatrick man was faced with the challenge of dancing the jive on Sundayrsquos show, known to be notoriously dficult for tall male dancers.Standing at ft in, the  year-old admitted it was tough going, but was personally delighted with his effort with professional dance partner Laura Nolan.Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Matthew told the Recorder: ldquoI was happy with my dance last night as I had a nightmare with it all week trying to get the timing and coordination down.ldquoThat was the best I danced it and I worked so hard all week but I guess giraffes arenrsquot meant to jive.In the end, it was novelist Cathy Kelly who was the first celebrity to leave the show.The local GAA player and digital marketing consultant said he had been overwhelmed by the support and votes he had received.He said: ldquoTo be bottom and to get through shows how amazing people are to vote for me and I really appreciate it.

ST MARYrsquoS KrsquoLEAGH.... THE big match of the week saw the top two teams face off against each other as the league leaders from Killyleagh made the trip to Spa to face the only team to have beaten them this year.They were just left to pick up the crumbs as the hosts continued their unbeaten run which led to this big win that no makes them favourites for the league with two games in hand and only eleven points behind with four rounds left to play.Davy Cavan, Paul and Don McNamara were up against Stevie Brown, Kieran McMullan and Ricky Cathcart and after four ends it was all square at -. But then Don upped the pressure and the hosts dominated thefinal ends to run out - winners.On the other mat the home triple of Hilary Cavan, Robin Horner and Graham Christie were playing some great bowls against Paddy Murray and after lting a count of six on the third end would only lose three ends in their - win. At the break the home side had a -shot overall lead.The Saints made a slight comeback in the third game as Philip Woodside, David Anderson and Neil Brown continued their good run of form against Frances and Derek McCann and skip Alan Laughlin, who after losing the first two ends won the next three to go - up before Alan hit back to make it it - after seven ends.This would be as good as it would get as the visitors won the last three ends to finish - winners to secure the only away points of the match.A mention must go to this triple for playing and controlling this game so well, especially as Philip had a throwback to past times with the quality of lead bowls.The last game of the night saw Rose Marie Wylie, Davy Vance and Peter Christie score seven shots from the first two ends against Terry Quinn, Nigel Brown and Tony Ward.They never relinguished this lead as the game finished - in their favour to secure another great win.Surely now no-one can stop Spa from continuing on and finish the season unbeaten and as champions.DROMARA..................... OWENBEG..................... DROMARA made their second trip to Owenbeg and got their best result of the season.They came away with a well deserved draw, but will be thinking they should have had the overall win.On mat one Jim McNeill, Brian and Ann Marie OrsquoHare were playing E Milligan, Marc Crothers and Sean Toman.They shared the end wins and at the end nothing could separate them as it finished -.On the other mat Mark Brady, Niall and Michael McGreevy were involved in an equally close game against Isobel Rooney, Damian Tumelty and David Gibson.After nine ends found themselves three up.Davidrsquos triple tried their best on the last end but could only manage to score two shots to finish - down.With only a couple of shots in it at half-time it was all still to play for. Dromararsquos Denis Kane, Richard Kelly and JamesMcKinney took control of their game against Haydn Tumelty, Dermot Rooney and Liam Higgins and even though they won only four ends and scored  shots to win -, this left Dromara with a five-shot lead in the overall.Owenbeg finally got going in the final game as Nathan Tumelty, Alan Telford and Collie Gibson really put Marie McNeill, Phil and Eamon Kelly to the sword.They only let their opponents score two shots as they scored steadily and heavily to run out victors by a - margin.It has to be said that Nathan was giving his team-mates an easy time with his standard of lead bowls on what are tricky mats.This win was enough to get Owenbeg the extra points and scrape an overall draw.ST MACARTANrsquoS........... MARINA........................ MARINA made the trip to Loughinisland and went home with a good eight points that keeps them the best of the rest after the top two.It was the Saints who got off to the better start with Kevin Cassidy, Ann Marie McGreevy and John Gavin winning - against Norman Gordon, but sadly this would be as good as it would get for the home side.On mat two the visiting triple of Jimmy Graham, John Cummings and Ronan Smyth were involved in a high scoring game against Francie McGreevy with both sides having multiple counts, but it was Ronan who was getting the better of them to finish winners by -.After the break it was back to a low scoring affair between Sammy Hardy, Gerry Toman and Don Corrigan, who were playing Patricia Russell, Roy McKibben and Joey Chambers, who would win the last three ends for a - win.The final game saw Raymond Gelston along with Cecilia Magill and Manzi Cullen score two threes on the first two ends but would not score again until the seventh end against Isobel Cunningham, Henry McDowell and Billy Collom, who finished strongly to win -.All in all, a good nightrsquos bowls for the visitors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Control.jpg","title":"Take back control in your life  ","story":"SO here we are officially into . How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times. If you feel that you like to find out more about ways of real self care, developing good habits and creating change, you can contact me on  .For the month of January, I am offering free -minute assessment sessions.

This device is located in a mph zone.A closer examination of the latest PCSP figures reveal that the mph speed in Ardglass was recorded on November  at am.In addition,  drivers were clocked at travelling over mph in the mph zone at the entrance to the village, with almost  percent of drivers detected travelling at between mph and mph. Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph. The highest number of offences was recorded at pm.The highest speed recorded at the Newcastlersquos South Promenade was mph, with two drivers recorded travelling at over mph. The highest number of speed offences were recorded around am.Across the council area, the latest figures indicate that recorded speeds have reduced by six percent. The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry. The consequences of a driver losing control of a car travelling at mph is truly frightening. The message that speed kills cannot be reinforced enough,he remarked.ldquoThere is clearly a hardcore of drivers who care little for their own safety, or that of other road users.

They enjoyed each otherrsquos company and are still coming to terms with the tragedy.Cllr Roisin Howell, who organised the event, told the assembled people: ldquoAll of us in the branch are shocked and saddened by the death of Ashling Murphy.ldquoThe brutal manner of her death has both angered and bewildered the entire nation.

She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/9387609.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Now he seems secure again.Days ago Boris Johnson seemed finished as prime minister. It was being reported last night that the only people who can sack him, Tory MPs, were now beginning to rally behind his leadership.Anda week is a long time, a year is an eternity.Arlene Foster’s demise was sudden. Edwin Poots’s rise to be her DUP successor was swt and his fall from that post almost as fast.Then only weeks ago there seemed to be a Westminster solution to the DUP’s challenge in getting its third leader in quick succession, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, into Stormont without having immediately to give up his Lagan Valley constituency and force a risky by-election there.But then that proposal — a temporary exemption to the double jobbing ban — was pulled from under him and there was fresh focus on how the DUP would manage the ious obstacles to finding a seat for Sir Jeffrey in the constituency where he is long established, but so are Mr Poots and Paul Givan.What then does last night’s political twist within the DUP mean By going for the South Down MLA nomination, Mr Poots was leaving the way clear for Mr Givan and Sir Jeffrey to be DUP MLAs for Lagan Valley .What did Jim Wells make of the Poots bid to move to the constituency in which Mr Wells is long established as the main DUP personality  Perhaps it was a disappointment, after Mr Wells had been such a gushing supporter of Edwin Poots as DUP leader.Or perhaps Mr Wells already knew that he was not going to be on the DUP shortlist, so it was not too much of a problem.Mr Poots will now have to cast around for another constituency.His leadership manoeuvre last May clearly annoyed much of the DUP establishment, who treated his victory with an overt coolness, even contempt, that the party rarely displayed in public towards senior figures, whatever private misgivings there might have been about any of them.Do some such figures now want to bury Mr Poots’s career entirely or were they only motivated by the view that Diane Forsythe was a better standard bearer in South Down One thing that strikes me about Mr Poots is an admirable ability to weather setbacks and even humiliations like his astonishingly brief tenure as DUP leader, and to soldier on without seeming bitter, so he might well cheerfully continue his search for a seat.The ious developments in unionism in recent weeks do not tell us much about ideological direction, except that the UUP and DUP are both chasing the liberal vote.In the case of Doug Beattie, it is a more explicit pitch to the values of the Alliance Party.In the case of Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, it is a move to capture the centre of unionism.But while the DUP is not moving in what anyone would call a strongly liberal direction, and while it still wants to be a broad church, it seems to have calculated that very traditional or fundamentalist Christian voters are sufficiently small in number that it can afford to lose many of them.It cannot afford to lose the growing numbers of people who are moderate on social questions such as abortion policy or same-sex relations. People, in other words, who are by no means radical on such matters but who are not traditionalists on them either.But all these political labels at times seem confused or contradictory.Doug Beattie is a ‘liberal’ who has, as a result of his tweets, potentially fallen foul of voters who have a ‘woke’ outlook on the world. He also took quite a robust unionist line on matters such as legacy and the Irish language.Edwin Poots is a ‘conservative’ who was in fact notably pragmatic on issues such as Gaelic and evenon the Irish Sea border.While it would not be quite right to characterise his politics as ‘liberal’ it was in no way hardline.Where will this all end Over the longer term unionism seems destined to become a centrist-leaning conservative movement. It will always been seen as somewhat on the right of the political spectrum because its primary position is preservation of the status quo. At the moment things seem bad for unionism, but that might not be so for long.There are still signs that very large numbers of voters, probably a comfortable majority, are themselves happy with the status quo.And radical liberal or leftist movements, in both the UK and the United States, have helped to bolster both the Conservative Party in England and the Republican Party in the US. In Northern Ireland, Alliance has been riding high for some years now, and certain polls suggest it could go higher still. But it might yet be damaged by its embracing of what some voters still consider to be ultra liberal values, or its europhilia A thing to watch is support for the TUV. Jim Allister’s standing in opinion polls fluctuates signicantly. He is trying to capture traditionalists, as is obvious from the party name, but also that large number of people who are very strong on the Union but not religious.l Ben Lowryis News Letter editor"},{"url":null,"title":"the dup gets weaker within grassroots unionism ","story":"Armed robber makes off with cash from shop after threatening staff   Ben Lowry: DUP seems to be staking out the centre of unionismNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionThe DUP gets weaker within grassroots unionismA letter from John Mulholland:By LettersSunday, th January , : pmUpdated Sunday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Letter to the editorYes, as Ben Lowry pointed out on Saturday January , the DUP are running out of road .The turnaround by Boris Johnson has brought them to a crossroads. It’s either continue to do nothing and run the assembly down until March, trusting Liz Truss, one of Johnson’s commandants, with the protocol, or collapse it now. The failure of the DUP to carry out their threats has left them in a very weak position. I would even question their support among grassroots unionist people who have seen their weakness.

It seems that the DUP position with grassroots unionism is weakening. They argue it was their opposition that has brought the foreign aggressors of the EU back to the table. If it were not so serious, it would be laughable. Who are they trying to kid  Someone like Kate Hoey and other lay people, who are not elected politicians, have taken more action to oppose the iniquitous protocol. May is fast approaching and we will be waiting for the usual spiel such as vote for usyou oppose the protocol. It took some unionist politicians time to waken up to the rubbish being spun, like, Northern Ireland can have the best of both worlds. If we look at the DUP’s record of their opposition, it is derisory.Unionist parties need to make their position clear that a vote for them will mean all-out war against the protocol evenit means scrapping support for the Belfast Agreementand pulling down the Assembly. The powers that be must be made to sit up and realise that unionists have had enough of their country being made a bargaining tool.

PIC: Rob Youngson Focus Features“I think that I probably began to realise over the years that the leaving of Belfast was really an event that I couldn’t ever escape in its impact,” reflects Sir Kenneth, now . “The film really describes quintessentially a  seconds where my le changed forever, when a mob came down our street, a neighbourhood that otherwise had been very peaceful and harmonious, where we lived side by side with Catholics.“In what followed, which was the street being completely reconfigured into a fortress really, I think a series of things psychologically started to kick in, like they do when youthful experiences have a big impact, that have been with me ever since.“I didn’t know how such a story could manest itself in a film, but at the beginning of this lockdown there were so many similar feelings thrown up of being unsettled, of le providing the unknown, and really a desire to reach for all the things that helped you get through it – humour, human connection, your family, and a search for all the coping mechanisms – music, dancing, anything that asserted le, and fun and certainty at a time when things were so very deeply uncertain.”Kenneth Branagh plays the great Dane in his adapted version of Shakespeares Hamlet in It has taken Sir Kenneth some time to realise that day was “a very, very, I suppose, traumatising thing”.“One of the reasons it takes so long is that a big part of the Northern Ireland DNA is that you don’t go on about stuff like this,” he muses. “You don’t indulge, you don’t suggest that your challenges, your struggles, your problems, are any greater than anybody ’s. “So it’s taken me a long time to get to the point where I realised that remains the truth, but it doesn’t mean that your story doesn’t have some kind of value, quite the opposite, because you begin to recognise that other people might benefit from understanding these moments. with his older brother Bill as children in Belfast before the family move to England after the outbreak of the Troubles in \" \"\" width\"\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMNDMy.jpg width w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMNDMy.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-intrinsic i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"intrinsic\" with his older brother Bill as children in Belfast before the family move to England after the outbreak of the Troubles in \" fallback layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"Kenwith his older brother Bill as children in Belfast before the family move to England after the outbreak of the Troubles in “Going back to experience it, in the doing of it, the shooting of it, it wasn’t so bad, because so much of that was mechanics. “It was afterwards, as you put it all together, and as it started to have its own le, it began to be a cumulatively more emotional experience. And it has had me quite a bit closer to tears on a day-to-day basis than I might otherwise be. But part of the process was understanding that tears can be helpful.”It was only during the editing process that Sir Kenneth, whose previous directing projects include Thor, Cinderella and Murder On The Orient Express – as well as a string of Shakespeare adaptations, thought about how the film might be received by others who had lived through this period in history.“The film sort of revealed that that’s what it was about, and that’s what it was for.

It couldn’t be more personal really, to be able to tell the story.“I left at , Caitriona left at , not to avoid the beginning of a war, but we all did for dferent reasons, and I understand what that means. And I’ve also spent  years going around the world, telling people I’m from Belfast and seeing all kinds of reactions to just that.“And I think this film can help to settle some of the ideas that people have about that place and the people in my place, because we get to see it through the eyes of a normal family and that’s really vital.”Balfe, , who was born in Dublin and grew up right on the border, added: “When I read the script one of the things that impacted upon me was just the compassion and the empathy Ken had for this ordinary working class family who had not asked for this. “We’ve seen many great films about the Troubles, but there’s been an absence of films just about the everyday family, who sort of got caught up among it.”From North Belfast to RADA and playing the great DaneSir Kenneth Charles Branagh was born on December , and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London where he has served as president since . He has been nominated for five Academy Awards, as well as having won three BAFTAs, two Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. Ken was knighted on November ,  and was made a Freeman of Belfast in January . In , he was listed at number  on Thelist of Ireland’s greatest film actors.Branagh has both directed and starred in several film adaptations of William Shakespeare’s plays, including Othello , and most notably Hamletwherein he played the tormented Dane and delivered the lapidary ‘To be or not to be’ speech with perhaps more fervour than any actor before or since. He was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Director for Henry V and for Best Adapted Screenplay for Hamlet.He has starred in innumerable television series and films including Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein , Wallanderand Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets .‘Overnight our street was turned into a war zone’ recalls Branagh of By Joanne SavageKenneth Branagh’s older brother Bill told Ann Ferran of The Sunday Times in : “Ken was a regular little boy growing up in Belfast, who played football in the street. When my father went away he’d bring us back a little matchbox car. I used to keep mine pristine clean, but Ken used to take the tyres off his.”In the same illuminating article, Ken said of the place where he grew up: “The area was predominantly Protestant, but there was a smattering of Catholics. Everybody got on. There was a real sense of community. “We had a large extended family. “Le in Belfast was very grounded and family-orientated, and Bill and I were thrown together - we shared a bed. I remember being in bed next to him, and whichever book he wasn’t reading for school I’d pick up. So I was introduced to Shakespeare through him. “The cardinal sin back in Belfast was to show off or make a fuss. ‘Don’t have any ideas above your station.’ That was my parents’ philosophy. “To them, money was only important for putting a roof over your head it wasn’t an end in itself. And a person’s religion made no dference to my parents, though not everyone in Belfast shared that view. “My Dad was a Protestant, but he was never in the Orange Order.”Sir Ken continued: “My mother had just got pregnant with my sister when things became quite intense in Belfast. One night Bill came running up our street saying: “Get in the house!” We heard a terrible buzzing noise. “I saw a sort of cloud at the bottom of the street, which turned out to be a huge bomb. “Bill pushed Mum and me under a table in the back room. We didn’t know it then, but it was the mob outside, who were picking up the iron gratings from the drains at the side of the roads and throwing them through the windows of the Catholic houses. “Hours later, there were barricades at the top and bottom of the street, while the men ided themselves into vigilante groups. “Our street had turned into a war zone overnight.“In the wake of that, my parents felt uneasy about Belfast. My father, who was a joiner, had been offered a job in England, at a management level, and they decided to take the opportunity.” Branagh added: “The move to England felt at times like some kind of betrayal. The transformation from that very grounded Belfast le, with its comfortable and simple expectations, had a profound effect on me. “I feel that only now do I have a strong sense of who I am in the way that I did in Belfast. “Today I’m less conflicted and guilt-ridden. And, believe me, Jews and Catholics don’t have a monopoly on guilt. “The Protestant work ethic was branded on my forehead:you are fit and talented it is your duty to use it.” Heartfelt tribute to a city with spirit defiantly undimmedFILM REVIEW: BELFASTBy Joanne SavageThis superbly directed film, shot in elegant monochrome, is a nostalgic and fiercely affectionate paean to a city that shaped its director in his heart and soul. Buddy, played by the adorable and wide-eyed Jude Hill, is a double for the young Ken, who, while crushing on the smartest girl in his class, and simply wanting to enjoy trips to the cinema to see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and play in the street with a fake sword and a bin lid, struggles to understand why violence breaks out so suddenly and inexplicably, as he looks up with wonder at his Pa, played masterfully and with real sensitivity by Jamie Dornan, who refuses to be drawn into the persecution of his Catholic neighbours, and emerges as the moral centre of the piece, alongside Caitriona Balfe’s stoical and beautul Ma.Ciaran Hinds and Judi Dench are profoundly affecting as Buddy’s grandparents, full of earthy, Ulsterish wit and tenderness, even as the community outside their humble terraced abode becomes mired in internecine stre.The warmth and humour shared among the family at epicentre of the film stands in stark contrast to the street vigilantes who will no longer tolerate the Catholics among them.There is a wonderful moment where Popis helping Buddy with his maths homework. Pop, ailing in health, tells him to make his answers blurry, to keep the teacher guessing, he might get marked up or down, but does he want to impress his would-be classroom sweetheart or not  Still, Buddy wants to know the right answer. “If there were a right answer son, and we all knew it, would they be doing what they’re doing out there ” muses Pop. Some may find Branagh’s liberally applied doses of sugar to a narrative about the birth of Belfastian tragedy something of a sentimental gloss over the true horrors of , but actually what the much vaunted director achieves here is heroic and defiant: as those who chose violence raged, le still found a way, love triumphed over hatred in most homes and nothing could blot out the fundamental spirit of the right-thinking members of both communities. We’ve all seen gritty films about the Troubles that besieged Belfast, but what Branagh is really saying is that through the eyes of a young boy living with a loving family who protected him, it was still shot through with magic, wonder and people who did not care about who was Catholic or Protestant or neither.Certainly Dornan’s Pa tells Buddy that it doesn’t matterthe girl he loves is a “Catholic or a Hindu or a vegetarian Antichrist” because Everlasting Loveis a flame unextinguished, indeed, as Morrissey might say, a light that never goes out.RATING:  Belfast is in cinemas now."},{"url":null,"title":"jim wells there could be a twist in tale of dup south down nomination ","story":"Bloody Sunday: First Minister Paul Givan will not attend th anniversary commemoration event   Ben Lowry: DUP seems to be staking out the centre of unionismNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPoliticsJim Wells: There could be a twist in tale of DUP South Down nominationOutgoing DUP MLA Jim Wells has insisted his political ally within the party, Edwin Poots, could yet win the party’s nomination to stand in the South Down constituency.By The NewsroomMonday, st January , : am  \"       \"  Jim Wells said he believed Edwin Poots was the obvious candidate for South Down when he realised he was toast“It’s not a foregone conclusion because the final decision has not yet been made,” Mr Wells said of the nomination of Diane Forsythe as the DUP candidate at the expense of former party leader Mr Poots.“The decision that was taken on Friday night can be challenged,” he added. “I think Edwin would have a lot of support in the DUP Executive committee.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

You can’t leave him not running in the election, you can’t.”Mr Wells said he was quick to lend his support to Mr Poots in the South Down selection contest, saying: “When it became apparent to me that I was toast, I was gone, the obvious person I thought was a very suitable candidate was Edwin who has vast experience and could give South Down first-class representation. “That hasn’t, as yet, happened and I think that’s very regrettable. “We’re going to have to wake up on Monday morning and ask ‘how do we deal with this’.”The News Letter approached Mr Poots, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, and Ms Forsythe for comment on the selection process yesterday.The party has remained tight-lipped following Friday’s selection process.A spokesman pointed the News Letter to a brief statement outlining its selection of Ms Forsythe.Jim WellsEdwin PootsJeffrey DonaldsonDUP  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most PopularBen Lowry: DUP seems to be staking out the centre of unionismSecond weather warning issued for parts of Northern Ireland as Storm Corrie arrivesMale dies after collision with car, police appealing for informationLee Johnston announces team manager role and confirms British Supersport bid in Armed robber makes off with cash from shop after threatening staffMost PopularBest indoor rowing machines UK : at home rowers including the best-selling Concept  and Aldi’s budget optionSmart smoke alarms UK: what do you need to keep your home safe from a fire, and is a heat alarm worth it  best women’s running shoes  UK: running trainers for women from Asics, On Cloud, Merrell, HokaBest wine subscription boxes UK : delicious discovery boxes from Savage Vines, Laithwaites, Virgin WinesBest Valentine’s Day gts for him : romantic gt ideas he will love, to suit every budget                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-fbyfCU sc-GEbAx ueSoA gsnYBQ\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
