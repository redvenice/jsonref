Video: Reuters Oireachtas TVNorthern Ireland’s Minister for Agriculture Edwin Poots: ‘The advice concluded that I can direct the checks to cease in the absence of Executive approval.’ Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA WireThe North’s Minister for Agriculture has ordered that post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland’s ports are to be halted from midnight tonight. The Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said that such a move by Mr Poots would be “a breach of international law”. “The protocol is part of an international agreement,” Mr Coveney told the Seanad on Wednesday evening. “It was agreed and ratified by the EU and the UK and its implementation is not only is it part of an international treaty, it’s part of international law.”“To deliberately frustrate obligations under that treaty would be a very serious matter indeed,” he said. “It would be essentially playing politics with legal obligations.”He said that the protocol was “designed and conceived to protect the Good Friday Agreement” and that it “fully recognises the constitutional position of Northern Ireland”. He urged that the negotiations between the UK and the EU on the protocol should be allowed to continue.“International law matters,” he said. However, making the announcement to reporters at Stormont, the Mr Poots said “a decision to initiate or continue such checks could not be validly taken in the absence of Executive approval. “The advice concluded that I can direct the checks to cease in the absence of Executive approval. “I have now issued a formal instruction to my permanent secretary to halt all checks that were not in place on December 31st 2020 from midnight tonight. “I will prepare a paper for Executive consideration in the near future to seek agreement on a way forward,” he said. The DUP and other unionist parties are opposed to the Northern Ireland protocol, the part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement which avoided a hard Border on the island of Ireland by creating a customs and regulatory border in the Irish Sea. They claim it is creating economic hardship and has undermined the North’s constitutional position as an integral part of the UK by placing a barrier between it and Britain. StuntSince the UK left the EU physical checks have been required for some agri-food shipments from Britain to Northern Ireland. Mr Poots sought legal advice from senior counsel after he attempted to bring a paper to the Northern Executive last week to seek a vote on the checks. It is party’s broader campaign against the protocol, which has led it to repeatedly threatened to withdraw its ministers from the Stormont Executive – potentially leading to the collapse of the power-sharing institutions – if sufficient changes are not made to the protocol. Mr Poots claimed recent court rulings mean the Executive must give its approval for the checks to continue, but last week’s move was criticised as a stunt by other parties, who maintain the Executive has already agreed his department is responsible for carrying out the checks and he does not have the authority to halt them as they are a requirement of the Brexit withdrawal agreement, an international agreement. Sinn Fein MLA John O’Dowd said the Northern Ireland protocol was the law and Mr Poots and all Executive ministers were required to follow the law.“The DUP signed off at the Executive that they would adhere to the regulations within the protocol,” he said. “I have a number of questions which require to be answered by Mr Poots. Where did he get this legal advice? “Did he go to the Attorney General? Did he use government legal advisers? “The facts remain the same. The Executive has a position that they will adhere to the protocol, to the European Withdrawal Agreement, and the principle remains for all Executive ministers, you have to adhere to the law,” he said. Mr O’Dowd said he had “no doubt” civil servants were “already taking advice on these matters. “The civil service has its own guidance and protocols to work to and I have no doubt the civil service will be examining that very closely,” he said. The Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said on social media that people were “tired of this grandstanding and instability” over the protocol and Mr Poots had “received clear legal advice in March 2020 when he first tried this stunt.” “The Executive was clear”, she said, as was the UK’s Department of Agriculture, that the department in Northern Ireland is “obliged by law to undertake these checks”.Asked by The  if the Department of Agriculture would follow the minister’s order, a Daera spokesman said: “The minister has received senior counsel advice and has issued an instruction on that basis.” Additional reporting - PA.

Photograph: Brian LawlessPA A wide range of expanded cost-of-living supports will be examined by the Government as it seeks to offset the impact of rampant inflation and insulate itself from political damage on the issue.Senior coalition sources acknowledged that the cost of living was the most pressing issue faced by the Government as the threat of Covid remained suppressed. “Everyone agrees it’s the burning issue,” one senior source said, with a “strong feeling we need to do more”. While a €100 support for utility bills has already been announced, there is a desire to go further, multiple sources confirmed, with scoping exercises planned for the coming days.“We’re casting the net as wide as we possibly can to look at the options,” a second senior source said. Consideration will be given to the “full range of costs and charges that people face to see what can be done”. Social welfareThe Coalition leaders, Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe and Minister for Public Expenditure Michael McGrath will steer the effort. Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys has asked her officials to present options for assisting those on social welfare. On Wednesday evening, Taoiseach Micheál Martin told his party that the Government was looking at measures to “enable people to cope with the cost of living increases” and to protect disposable incomes “during this difficult time”. Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar told his parliamentary party on Wednesday evening the electricity subsidy was “not enough” and that “more needs to be done to help families”. He cautioned, however, that there would not be a “mini-budget”. Mr McGrath told an Oireachtas committee that “you can never go far enough at the moment given the level of inflation that is there”. Inflation was now expected to be higher across the year than the 2.2 per cent anticipated at budget time, he said. While specific measures have not yet been identified, sources suggested further energy subsidies or measures to shield people from charges directly imposed by the Government could be considered. However, the State’s capacity to drive down the costs of rent, mortgages, groceries and other items which present a burden on households was limited in the short term, sources said. It is expected that further discussion will take place at a meeting of the Cabinet subcommittee on economic recovery planned for next Thursday. Buoyant tax takeCoalition figures expect to come under pressure from unions on Thursday on inflation, when a meeting of the Labour Employer Economic Forum convenes, with one eye on public pay talks which are planned for the autumn. However, Ministers are pointing to a buoyant tax take as giving them room for manoeuvre. “We’re conscious the exchequer returns present a favourable backdrop,” one said. It comes after the latest exchequer data showed pre-Christmas spending by consumers generated more than €3 billion in VAT receipts for the Government in January. This was €400 million more than in the first month of 2020, before the pandemic hit.The figures published by the Department of Finance show the Government collected €6.7 billion in tax last month, up 24 per cent (€1.3 billion) on the same month last year. Some €3.1 billion came from sales tax as consumers spent more in shops and online in the lead-up to Christmas and during the post-Christmas sales period."},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics politics after the pandemic","story":"Opposition parties are still putting pressure on the Government over the so-called “champagne party” in the Department of Foreign Affairs on the night Ireland was elected to the UN Security Council two years ago, but will the incident have any lasting political impact?

Asked if the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (Daera) would follow the Minister’s order, a spokesman said: “The Minister has received senior counsel advice and has issued an instruction on that basis.”Lorries were still being received at a Daera checking facility in Belfast Port earlier on Thursday morning. Several vehicles entered the facility after the ferry arrived from Cairnryan in Scotland at 6am.A staff member declined to confirm to the PA news agency whether the Northern Ireland Protocol checks were continuing.Announcing his ordering of a halt to the checks, Mr Poots told reporters on Wednesday that “a decision to initiate or continue such checks could not be validly taken in the absence of Executive approval” and therefore the advice “concluded that I can direct the checks to cease”.“I have now issued a formal instruction to my permanent secretary to halt all checks that were not in place on December 31st, 2020, from midnight tonight.”He said he would prepare a paper for the Northern Ireland Executive’s consideration “in the near future to seek agreement on a way forward”.Move condemnedThe move was strongly condemned by the Irish Government and by Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Alliance Party, who questioned the legal basis for Mr Poots’s action and said it was more about politics than attempting to find a solution to the issues around the protocol.Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said such a move would be “a breach of international law”.He said the protocol was part of an international agreement, and “to deliberately frustrate obligations under that treaty would be a very serious matter indeed”.“It would be essentially playing politics with legal obligations,” he said, and urged that the negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the protocol should be allowed to continue.Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill described it as a “stunt” and an “attempt by the DUP to unlawfully interfere with domestic and international law”.It is understood the UK government has been in touch with the Northern Executive and is considering the details, including the legal position. A UK government spokesman appeared to indicate it would not seek to intervene, saying “the operation of checks” was a matter for the Executive, adding that there were “significant problems with the protocol which urgently need fixing”.UK foreign secretary Liz Truss is to speak to European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic on Thursday, the spokesman said."},{"url":null,"title":"russia demands answers from ireland about security stance","story":"The letters signed by Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, question whether the recipients have abided by a security agreement signed in 1999. Photograph: Jean-Christophe BottEPAPoolIreland is among the countries to receive a terse letter from the Russian government demanding answers about its security policy as tensions rise over Ukraine.The letters, signed by Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, were sent to a wide group of countries including the United States, Canada and European states at a delicate moment as Russian troops massed near the Ukraine border.The letters question whether the recipients have abided by a security agreement signed in 1999, broadly casting western countries as the aggressors in current tensions.“You are well aware that Russia is seriously concerned about increasing politico-military tensions in the immediate vicinity of its western borders,” reads a version of the letter published by the Russian government.There are “serious differences in the understanding of the principle of equal and inisible security that is fundamental to the entire European security architecture,” it adds.“We believe it is necessary to immediately clarify this issue, as it will determine the prospects for future dialogue.”The letter refers to a 1999 agreement of the 57-member Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), signed in Istanbul at a time when Bertie Ahern was taoiseach.That accord stated that countries were free to choose their security arrangements, alignment or neutrality but that they “will not strengthen their security at the expense of the security of other states”.After sending the letters, Mr Lavrov told reporters that western countries were trying to do away with this principle.Moscow views Nato’s expansion eastwards following the cold war as aggressive encroachment, and sees a provocation in Nato’s refusal to rule out accepting Ukraine as a member. Nato insists it is merely a defensive alliance that new members can join.The letters request a “prompt” response, and asks that countries write back inidually rather than co-ordinating joint replies.Not exclusiveEU diplomats will discuss the letters when they meet to discuss the security situation on Thursday, and may consider whether to co-ordinate a response.The Government has said it will respond to the letter from Mr Lavrov “in due course”.“We understand that Minister Lavrov has written to all his OSCE counterparts regarding the principles underpinning collective European security, as outlined in various OSCE agreements and acts,” a spokesman for Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney said.“Minister Coveney received the letter on Monday and intends to reply to the letter in due course.”Speaking before the Oireachtas committee on foreign affairs on Wednesday evening as news of the letter broke, Russia’s ambassador to Ireland, Yuriy Filatov, said the letter was “not an exclusive letter to Ireland”.“With the only point and question ... how do you at this point in time view the principle of inisibility of security?”“You can tell by our own discussion here that it’s quite an important and crucial thing to make up our minds, because with the answer to this question everything else will depend upon.

The commission’s report is currently being assessed by the Government, which is scheduled to deliver an implementation plan by next month.But Government sources say that the country has to face the looming question of the affordability of the pension system, with Ministers insisting there are few easy choices to address the inevitable demographic pressures.Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe said the Government was likely to make a decision on the State pension age by the end of March.Government sources said that no decision had yet been made though the political difficulty of the issue is clear. Both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil reversed their previous position on increasing the pension age during the last election campaign under pressure from the Labour Party and Sinn Féin. Mr Donohoe said the decision on the State pension age was very important due to the cost implications.Longer lives“The only money the Government has is the money that the Government collects from its citizens or borrows in their name in the future,” Mr Donohoe told the RTÉ News at One programme.He said while it was welcome that people were living longer, at present there were 4.5 workers for every pensioner.However, by 2050, due to demographic trends, this would fall to just two workers for every State pension holder.The economic consequences of this could mean “there will be things we will not be able to do”, Mr Donohoe warned.In the Dáil, Taoiseach Micheál Martin said the Government had “an open mind” when it came to decisions on the pension age.Mr Martin said there were no easy choices and any proposals must be “fiscally sound”.Mr Martin said the fact that people were living longer had implications for “pensions, for how we sustain society with longer lives and greater access to healthcare and interventions”."},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"havana syndrome could be caused by pulsed energy devices us expert report says","story":"Pulsed electromagnetic energy had been “credibly demonstrated” to cause the observed symptoms, the panel found.A US intelligence report by a panel of expert scientists has named pulsed electromagnetic energy and ultrasound as plausible causes for the mystery Havana Syndrome symptoms suffered by US diplomats and spies in recent years.The report found that a group of cases could not be explained by health or environmental factors or by psychosomatic illness. It also said that devices exist with “modest energy requirements” which were concealable and could produce the observed symptoms and be effective over hundreds of meters or through walls.The panel, established last year by the director of national security, Avril Haines, and the CIA director, William Burns, said the investigation was not tasked to identify a culprit, but in a statement accompanying the report, Haines and Burns said it would help sharpen the search for the origins of the mysterious ailments.“We will stay at it, with continued rigor, for however long it takes,” they said.In a redacted executive summary of its report published on Wednesday, the panel of experts said that the signs and symptoms of the syndrome were “erse and may be caused by multiple mechanisms” but that a subset of them “cannot be easily explained by known environmental or medical conditions”.The expert panel report clashed in tone to a briefing given by the CIA last month which said that in the majority of cases, there was no sign of a malignant campaign by a foreign power. That briefing, possibly aimed at limiting the further spread of psychosocial illness among US officials, did caution that in some two dozen cases the symptoms could not be easily explained.The latest panel narrowed its review of the hundreds of reported cases by defining four “core characteristics”: the sudden onset of sound or pressure in one ear or one side of the head near simultaneous symptoms like vertigo, loss of balance and ear pain a “strong sense of locality or directionality” – the feeling of being assailed from a particular direction and the absence of known environmental or medical conditions that might otherwise explain the symptoms.The summary did not go into details of cases, but the description of symptoms matched the earliest cases in 2016 reported among US and Canadian diplomats stationed in Havana, from which the syndrome got its name.The expert panel found “the combination of the four core characteristics is distinctly unusual and unreported elsewhere in the medical literature, and so far have not been associated with a specific neurological abnormality”.When looking at probable causes, the panel – which includes experts on medicine and engineering – pointed towards some form of external energy source.The report found that: “Pulsed electromagnetic energy, particularly in the radio frequency range, plausibly explains the core characteristics, although information gaps exist.”It added that “sources exist that could generate the required stimulus, are concealable, and have moderate power requirements”.Using what the report described as “nonstandard antennas and techniques”, electromagnetic pulsed energy could be directed at a target “through air for tens to hundreds of meters, and with some loss, through most building materials”.Pulsed electromagnetic energy had been “credibly demonstrated” to cause the observed symptoms, the panel found, and that “persons accidentally exposed to radio frequency signals described sensations similar to the core characteristics”.However, the report said there was a “dearth of research” on the effects of such pulsed electromagnetic energy on humans.Engineers who had been working on a potential weapon for the US marines two decades ago, known as Medusa, said that one of the reasons it was discontinued was that it was ethically impossible to conduct human tests on the prototype.A large part of the section on pulsed electromagnetic energy was redacted in the published expert panel report.The executive summary said that ultrasound energy was also a plausible explanation for the symptoms but only in situations where the source was close to the target. – Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"boriss betrayal revolutionary brexit mandate now almost total","story":"This is the week a Government that began with such promise finally lost its soul.

It was not to be.Michael Gove’s levelling-up blueprint is a grotesque disappointment, a list of buzzwords and targets masquerading as strategy, its pseudo-intellectual veneer and cod history intended to camouflage the fact that it essentially advocates the very same nostrums that ultimately destroyed Labour.A proper conservative approach to levelling-up would focus on schooling, and the heart-breaking results of the white working class. It would investigate family policy and the values crisis. It would create dozens of libertarian pro-business areas, run by development corporations, with almost no taxes and regulation. It would target cheaper energy. It would liberate an extra one per cent of Britain’s landmass for house building. It would tackle the failed monolith that is the NHS. It would not see spending on public transport as a panacea. It would reject targets, subsidies and bureaucracies. It would break with socialism.Instead, Torsten Bell of the Left-wing Resolution Foundation, Britain’s most influential economics think-tank despite our nominally Tory administration, describes Johnsonian levelling up as a fusion between George Osborne and New Labour. “The agenda combines the devolution of the former Conservative Chancellor with the last Labour government’s biggeractivist central state reprioritising spend towards deprived areas”, as he puts it.A central problem is that too many Tories now have a vested interest in pretending that the form of devolution practiced in this country has been a success. This is the very reverse of the truth.Competition between local jurisdictions works, but only if set up correctly. Britain’s flawed model encourages bailouts from Westminster, grants power without fiscal responsibility and encourages municipal socialism. It doesn’t incentivise local leaders to improve competitiveness, or to think carefully enough about spending projects.Eurosceptics were always opposed to Labour’s flawed devolution: The North East Says No campaign, which defeated John Prescott’s devolution drive in 2004, was a dry run for the Brexit referendum, and included figures who went on to work for Vote Leave.The Tories also have not answered a fundamental contradiction: why do they want to make everywhere like London, given that our capital voted Corbyn and Remain? Left to its own devices, London would self-destruct, imposing punitive taxes and chasing away its value-creators. Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, is at it again, threatening to shut roads and tube services if he isn’t bailed out. We need more Canary Wharfs, created before devolution, and fewer City Halls.In the US, the Republicans don’t want to turn the whole of America into New York or San Francisco – they look instead at Texas or Florida. We need to replicate the brilliant bits of London, its ability to create jobs and wealth, without the socialism and cultural Left-wingery. If the Tories really believed in local accountability, they would break London up into several competing entities, not create yet more dysfunctional, statist, subsidy-hungry, rotten boroughs all over the country.If the establishment technocrats are getting everything they want, the Right has been left with almost nothing, including on Brexit. The scale of the betrayal is staggering. The Brexit white paper is one of the most shameful economic policy documents ever produced by a Conservative government. Margaret Thatcher’s Bruges Speech, Christopher Booker’s Mad Officials, Brian Hindley’s Better Off Out, the Open Europe deregulatory reports, Business for Britain’s Change or Go: all targeted over-regulation. Yet that powerful intellectual movement, built over decades, has virtually zero presence in the Remainers’ Brexit being delivered by Johnson.There have, of course, been major changes on immigration and foreign policy, and the vaccination success would not, in practice, have happened had we been part of the EU. That alone means that it was worth it, though the agricultural reforms are flawed. The decision to allow Hong Kongers to settle would also have been politically impossible had EU free movement still existed.But when it comes to the economy, the Government’s policy barely differs from Theresa May’s Brexit in name only. The authors of the 2016 Treasury attacks on Brexit have triumphed: they argued that there was very little in Britain’s tax, spend and regulatory structure that needed to be changed, and, staggeringly, Johnson’s government now agrees.All of which brings us to energy policy, another case study in extreme failure. A sensible government would urgently accelerate its nuclear plans by creating a powerful agency modelled on the vaccines taskforce. As a temporary solution, such an administration would also push to extract more oil and gas, including by fracking.Instead, a government that no longer believes in markets will now simply pretend that prices are much lower than they are. The Treasury will lend billions to energy companies to allow them to moderate price rises customers will then pay higher bills in the future to ensure the Treasury (hopefully) recoups its money.The furlough and bailouts that accompanied Covid – necessary evils given state-mandated lockdowns – have perverted our politics, undermining self-reliance and normalising handouts.That wail you hear is the cry of Toryland: among the true believers, the long-marchers, the Eurosceptics and the free-marketeers, there is sorrow, anger and despair.

It is the first time a university cancel culture row will be heard in court.The row has seen fellows at Cambridge pitted against academics from Oxford University. Prof Lawrence Goldman, a Jesus alumnus and an Emeritus Fellow in History St Peter\u0027s College, Oxford, opposed Jesus\u0027s application. Opponents have called Prof Nigel Biggar, a Regius Professor of Moral and Pastoral Theology at Oxford, as a witness.For opponents, attempting to remove the memorial represents an oversimplification of history and denies students the chance to think for themselves.But the college has taken the view that it represents a celebration of Rustat that is incompatible with the chapel as an inclusive community and a place of collective wellbeing.Rustat (1608-1694) was a courtier to Charles II and an investor in the Royal African Company (RAC) and the Company of Royal Adventurers, both slaving enterprises.He commissioned the memorial himself when he was already a significant benefactor to the college.Supporters of retaining the monument, including Dr Goldman, have argued that the totality of his life should be considered, not just his investments in slavery. Among his many other donations was a contribution to the reconstruction of St Paul\u0027s cathedral.Reverend James Crockford, the chapel\u0027s dean, who is responsible for the historic building, believes the memorial is a barrier to (students\u0027) participation in the chapel, the hearing was told.He told the court that there were students who did not attend the chapel because they “find it distressing to enter” and others who attended but “feel disquieted and discomfited by the presence of the memorial”.Being questioned, he was asked Do you think that church should always be a safe space? and he gave an adamant yes.But Justin Gau, the lawyer representing opponents to the memorial\u0027s removal, said: We shouldn\u0027t remove the difficulties life throws at us in a chapel, should we?.Mr Gau also suggested that adding context to the memorial to Rustat would be enough to stop it being distressing to students.For some unchurched undergraduates, he said, seeing images of Jesus, a crucified man, a dead man who had been tortured, might also be disturbing, if they didn\u0027t have the well-known context of Christianity.Mr Gau raised the role of slavery in the Bible, saying: Where, for example, in the gospels is slavery condemned?Were the memorial not to be moved, the Rev Crockford said, some of these students would be a “lot less ready to participate in the life of the chapel” and that it “would do untold damage to reputation of chapel within college” and its role in non-religious events.Historic England has warned that its removal would harm the significance of Jesus College Chapel.In 1671, Rustat donated £2,000 (approx £450,000 in today\u0027s money) to Jesus College for the education of the orphan sons of Anglican clergy.His investment in the Royal African Company is believed to have been £400. He is better known, however, for serving Charles II for 18 years, including in exile in Europe and during the English Civil War.The decision to attempt have the plaque removed came after the college set up a Legacy of Slavery Working Party (LSWP) to pursue critical self-reflection on the long-term legacies of slavery and colonial violence.The group of eight academics and two students recommended that the memorial be contextualised and its history acknowledged.The LSWP was also behind the return in 2021 of a large bronze cockerel looted from Benin City in the 19th Century.As the chapel comes under the jurisdiction of the Diocese of Ely, the college has had to petition a consistory court for permission to remove the plaque.The hearing is taking place in the chapel itself, with representatives and witnesses regularly gesturing towards and turning around in their seats to look at the memorial.The college wants to place it on permanent display elsewhere in the college alongside “contextualising” material.Alumni have also written in support of the college\u0027s application, including witness Amatey Doku - a former Cambridge Union president who was part of a group that led a five-year campaign to hand back Jesus College’s Okukor Bronze, one of the Benin Bronzes.Mr Mark Hill QC, representing the college, told the court that “This is nothing to do with erasing, cancelling or in some way nullifying the existence and the name of Tobias Rustat”.The Right Reverend Stephen Conway, the Bishop of Ely, told the hearing that the memorial needed to be removed so that current students were not reminded of the ways in which their forebears were tortured and dehumanised.Mr Gou and Mr Goldman, who is also representing the petitioners opposed, both questioned witnesses as to why the memorial could not be contextualised in situ.Sonita Alleyne, the master of Jesus College and the first black master of any Oxbridge college, told the hearing that adding context “wouldn’t take the memorial out of a position of veneration”.Mr Gau said Mr Rustat was a generous benefactor of the college and that, despite his very small involvement in the slave trade, there was now a black female master of the college.Ms Alleyne replied: How much sin do you need to have before you come off the wall?Defenders of Rustat have previously insisted that only a small fraction of his wealth ever came from slavery and that he was not directly or actively involved in it.Speaking in the hearing, Mr Gau said that students had made incorrect statements about Rustat’s involvement.Mr Gau referred to a phrase often repeated in students\u0027 emails: It\u0027s totally wrong for the statue of someone who was so heavily involved in the horrific crimes of slavery to be glorified in the heart of our community.And he said one email saying Mr Rustat made his money from slavery and caused immeasurable human suffering was incorrect.The Rev Crockford replied: It\u0027s my understanding that he did make some of his money from slavery.A student\u0027s email dated December 19 2020 said Mr Rustat amassed much of his wealth from the RAC, which Mr Gau said is simply not true.Another email from an undergraduate expressed strong support for the removal of the memorial, and claimed Mr Rustat has been clearly demonstrated as a very active slave trader.Mr Gau said there was no demonstration in any document that Tobias Rustat was any sort of slave trader.The Rev Crockford said: Not perhaps in the narrow definition of the word.The hearing will continue on Thursday.More from NewsCouncils to record which children are being home schooledMary Beard tells those who cheered the toppling of Colston: your lifestyle depends on ‘slavery’ tooHeat pumps could leave householders in the cold by failing to warm homes adequatelyAfghan Christians have been abandoned\u0026#39It\u0026#39s one hour to midnight for Boris Johnson\u0026#39: Our writers discuss the PM\u0026#39s futureMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"plaid cymru demands end quirky names farm called hakuna matata","story":"Plaid Cymru has demanded an end to “quirky” non-traditional names after a farm named “Hakuna Matata” replaced the original Welsh title on an Ordnance Survey map.Sara Davies bought a plot of empty land, originally named Banc Cornicyll, near Gorslas, Carmarthenshire, in 1997.She built a house on the land and named the property with the Swahili phrase, which means “there are no troubles” and is used in the Disney film The Lion King.Now it has emerged that this change means the original name no longer appears anywhere on the Ordnance Survey map.Speaking to Wales Online, Mrs Davies said that the name, Banc Cornicyll, had disappeared before they had purchased the land in 1997, although it is listed on documents recording the sale still on the land registry.She added: We went to the Post Office, and said we were a new-build house.They said there was no registered address for the land so we could choose to call it whatever we liked.Obviously Lion King was popular at the time, some of my husband’s friends had been working in South Africa and knew that ‘hakuna matata’ wasn’t just a Disney term but genuine Swahili and therefore it had a meaning to it.”Despite Mrs Davies saying she would never have changed the name if she knew there was a historic alternative, Plaid Cymru warned that there was a growing “trend of anglicising names”.Plaid Cymru’s rural affairs and housing spokesperson, Mabon ap Gwynfor, said: “Wales has its own language and culture. This is no clearer imprint of this than in the unique place names of many homes, farms and places across the country.“As part of safeguarding the language, there must be an end to this trend of anglicising names, and the false belief that having quirky or anglicised names makes somewhere more palatable for others.“Our place names, be they houses or fields, tells a story, a story that is unique to this corner of the world. That rich heritage is a treasure that must be valued and protected.“There must be mechanisms in place, whether that’s through planning or legislation, to help protect the language, and to reflect the valuable history of locations in Wales.”Solicitor Simon Chandler, who helped create a scheme called Diogelwn, which aims to protect Welsh names, said a lot of people simply don’t understand the importance of place names.He added: “It is important because a house name or a place name is like a time capsule.“It tells us something about the history of the land and every time we lose one of those we lose a connection with the land and the past.“A lot of people who buy houses don\u0027t necessarily understand the significance of the name.”Mr Chandler’s scheme wants those who intend to sell property to include a clause in the contract which would block buyers from changing the name.More from NewsCouncils to record which children are being home schooledMary Beard tells those who cheered the toppling of Colston: your lifestyle depends on ‘slavery’ tooHeat pumps could leave householders in the cold by failing to warm homes adequatelyAfghan Christians have been abandoned\u0026#39It\u0026#39s one hour to midnight for Boris Johnson\u0026#39: Our writers discuss the PM\u0026#39s futureMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"trusting people do right thing saved lives covid lockdowns","story":"Lockdowns prevented just 0.2 per cent of deaths in comparison with simply trusting people to do the right thing, a new study suggests.Researchers from Johns Hopkins University, in the US, Lund University, in Sweden and the Centre for Political Studies, in Denmark, said the costs to society far outweighed the benefits and called for lockdown to be “rejected out of hand” as a future pandemic policy.The team even found that some lockdown measures may have increased deaths by stopping access to outdoor space, “pushing people to meet at less safe places” while isolating infected people indoors, where they could pass the virus on to family members and housemates.“We do find some evidence that limiting gatherings was counterproductive and increased Covid-19 mortality,” the authors concluded. “Often, lockdowns have limited people’s access to safe outdoor places such as beaches, parks, and zoos, or included outdoor mask mandates or strict outdoor gathering restrictions, pushing people to meet at less safe indoor places.”To calculate the benefits of lockdown, the researchers looked at 24 academic papers estimating their effectiveness as well as other interventions such as wearing masks, business and school closures, border closures and stay-at-home orders.They found that some measures did save lives. Closing non-essential businesses was estimated to have lowered mortality by about 10.6 per cent, a fall largely driven by closing drinking establishments.Shutting schools probably also lowered deaths by 4.4 per cent, while asking people to stay at home prevented 2.9 per cent of deaths and border controls roughly 0.1 per cent.However, the researchers found that legally enforced lockdowns were only a tiny bit better at cutting deaths than allowing the public to follow recommendations including working from home and limiting social contact, as happened in countries such as Sweden.The first lockdown prevented just 0.2 per cent of deaths, they concluded – which for Britain in the first wave would mean it saved about 100 lives out of 52,000 – when compared to letting people take precautions themselves.Jonas Herby, a special adviser at the Centre for Political Studies and one of the study’s authors, told The : “When we look at lockdown, we don’t find much of an effect. “We think that most people don’t want to get sick or infect their neighbours, so if you just give people the proper knowledge they do the right thing to take care of themselves, and others, and so that’s why lockdowns don’t work.“In general, we should trust that people can make the right decisions, so the key thing is to educate them and tell them when the infection rates are high and when it’s dangerous to go out and how to protect yourself.“One possible reason that lockdowns seem ineffective is that some measures are counterproductive. There is some evidence that putting limits on gatherings actually increased the number of deaths.”The authors criticised the original Imperial College London model which suggested that Britain could see 500,000 deaths without a lockdown, saying it did not take into account the real-world behaviour of people during a pandemic.Researchers said it was clear that the public would naturally socially distance and cut their contacts even without state intervention, leading to a large drop in deaths. Steve Hanke, a professor of applied economics at Johns Hopkins University and another of the study’s authors, said: “Lockdowns in Europe and the US decreased Covid-19 mortality by a measly 0.2 per cent on average, while the economic costs of lockdowns were enormous. I find zero evidence to support lockdowns.”One of the studies cited in the review found that voluntary behavioural changes are 10 times as important as mandatory behavioural changes in combating Covid. It found that lockdowns only regulate “a fraction of our potential contagious contacts” and cannot enforce hand washing, coughing etiquette or how close people stand together in supermarkets.Countries such as Denmark, Finland and Norway, which all kept mortality relatively low, allowed people to go to work, use public transport and meet privately at home during the first lockdown, the authors said.They concluded: “Lockdowns during the initial phase of the Covid-19 pandemic have had devastating effects. They have contributed to reducing economic activity, raising unemployment, reducing schooling, causing political unrest, contributing to domestic violence and undermining liberal democracy.“These costs to society must be compared to the benefits of lockdowns, which our meta-analysis has shown are marginal at best. Such a standard benefit-cost calculation leads to a strong conclusion: lockdowns should be rejected out of hand as a pandemic policy instrument.”Critics of the study claimed the authors have conflicting interests, particularly Prof Hanke, who has been an outspoken critic of restrictions that damage the economy. He also signed the Great Barrington Declaration, which called for the shielding of the most vulnerable while allowing the virus to spread through society, allowing the build-up of natural immunity.Many scientists believe lockdowns were essential before vaccines and antiviral drugs were available, with one study suggesting the first lockdown saved 20,000 lives in Britain. Imperial College estimated that lockdowns saved about 3.1 million lives in Europe, including 470,000 in Britain.More from NewsCouncils to record which children are being home schooledMary Beard tells those who cheered the toppling of Colston: your lifestyle depends on ‘slavery’ tooHeat pumps could leave householders in the cold by failing to warm homes adequatelyAfghan Christians have been abandoned\u0026#39It\u0026#39s one hour to midnight for Boris Johnson\u0026#39: Our writers discuss the PM\u0026#39s futureMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"afghan christians have abandoned","story":"A strange and ancient verse in the book of Deuteronomy, 26.5, has long puzzled scholars. It says, “a wandering Aramean was my father” and is at the centre of vexed and energetic Rabbinic argumentation. One obvious meaning, however, is that the Hebrew people were themselves a migrant people – as the Bible clearly indicates. Migration is, of course, part of the human story to be found in the history of the British Isles as well as the Middle East, and everywhere where there are communities of people who suffer conflict, or natural disaster.But the displacement of millions of people in recent times is unprecedented, and the sheer numbers of those risking their lives to cross the Channel even on cold mid-winter days tell a story of desperation that is experienced all over the world. Many people fear that as the world fragments into conflict and climate change places pressure on resources, migration may spiral out of control.Today a new Fund is being launched in the name of the great 20th-century wartime leader, Bishop George Bell, specifically to support persecuted Christian pastors who are refugees. George Bell famously helped Lutheran pastors who opposed Hitler and had to flee for their lives. He, together with other British humanitarians such as Sir Nicholas Winton, recognised a need and acted upon it. There are still times today when Government inaction means that private iniduals have to act in the wake of a crying need.In response to the refugee crisis, former prime minister Gordon Brown said: “We’ve got to act for moral reasons but also it’s in our own self-interest to do so.” This reminded me of Archbishop William Temple’s dictum that the art of government is the art of so ordering life that self-interest prompts what justice demands. Both are right – allowing the situation to get worse is irresponsible.Another point to note is the fear in stable societies that we might be unsettled by the consequences of allowing large numbers from other cultural traditions to settle among us. I recognise the worry which, to some degree, we all share. Clearly those who join us must recognise that they need to embrace the values, traditions and history of the host nation, just as the hosts will allow the customs of the migrants to have a place among us.We are enriched by the presence of those who have joined us in recent decades. I hope the UK will give a firm moral lead as nations respond to the crisis facing the world today.To take one example, Afghanistan is now recognised by the Open Doors charity’s “watch list” as the worst place in the world to be a Christian. In spite of the pleas of organisations working with persecuted Christians, who face the death penalty for apostasy under the country’s strict interpretation of shariah law, the Government has not taken any steps at all to allow Christians to claim asylum in the UK. We have been awaiting a long-promised announcement from ministers on how they plan to include persecuted religious minorities in resettlement schemes.Barnabas Fund Freedom of Information requests to the UK Home Office found that in the Syrian resettlement scheme, Christians were consistently underrepresented in spite of the fact that they clearly faced violence and persecution. A tiny percentage – just 0.2 per cent – of the Syrian refugees accepted by the UK in 2017 were Christian. Underlying such shameful statistics was the Home Office’s apparent admission in its own equality assessment that the effect of its policy was to “disproportionately advantage” Muslims.Several hundred Afghan Christians, including pastors and converts, are currently in hiding in neighbouring countries. They are waiting to see whether they have a place on the UK Government’s resettlement scheme.The George Bell Memorial Fund will help them flee danger, despotism and violence, and travel to safety – whether they land on British shores or elsewhere. Sometimes it takes brave humanitarians like George Bell to stand up against even our own Government and bring the persecuted to safety.George Carey is a former Archbishop of Canterbury.

Instead, what the Government should be focusing on is making sure that vital support services are available to support schools and pupils when they need it.”More from NewsMary Beard tells those who cheered the toppling of Colston: your lifestyle depends on ‘slavery’ tooHeat pumps could leave householders in the cold by failing to warm homes adequatelyAfghan Christians have been abandoned\u0026#39It\u0026#39s one hour to midnight for Boris Johnson\u0026#39: Our writers discuss the PM\u0026#39s futureStatism is not the route to levelling upMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"ketamine effective treatment curbing suicidal thoughts says","story":"Ketamine is an effective treatment for suicidal thoughts among three-fifths of patients, a study has suggested.The drug was tested by researchers at the University of Montpellier, France, compared to a placebo in a clinical trial among patients hospitalised for severe suicidal thoughts.The study, published in the British Medical Journal, recruited 156 participants who had been voluntarily admitted.About half of the patients had two 40-minute intravenous infusions of ketamine, while the control group had a placebo, in addition to their usual treatment.After three days, the participants were scored according to a scale for suicidal ideation by clinicians, to assess their rate of full remission from suicidal thoughts.More patients receiving ketamine reached full remission at day three than those receiving the placebo - 63 per cent versus 32 per cent, the study found.All side effects of the trial were reported as minor.Between day four and week six, the drug continued to have better full remission from suicidal ideation than the placebo group, but the authors said the results were not significant.Ketamine is a powerful and fast-acting sedative, and previous research has shown it can have a rapid effect on depressive symptoms after one dose.The drug is licensed to be used by doctors as an anaesthetic in England. However, it cannot currently be prescribed on the NHS to treat depression, as it is yet to be approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence as a cost-effective treatment.Researchers set out to examine if full remission of suicidal thoughts is achieved 72 hours after two infusions of the drug compared to a placebo.The effect of the drug was greatest in patients with bipolar disorder, the authors said, while no meaningful benefit was seen in patients with major depression or other mental illness.Concluding the study, the authors cautioned whether ketamine will be given to eligible patients with suicidal thoughts any time soon, “given the plausible concern that the widespread use of ketamine might trigger a new opioid style crisis”.In a linked editorial, Riccardo De Giorgi, of the University of Oxford, said: “Whether ketamine reduces suicidal ideation in some people is a matter of evidence, which this trial by Abbar and colleagues provides.“But whether the emergency use of ketamine for suicidal crises will be recommended in practice depends on many other factors, including the values and preferences of patients, clinicians, researchers and policymakers.”More from NewsCouncils to record which children are being home schooledMary Beard tells those who cheered the toppling of Colston: your lifestyle depends on ‘slavery’ tooHeat pumps could leave householders in the cold by failing to warm homes adequatelyAfghan Christians have been abandoned\u0026#39It\u0026#39s one hour to midnight for Boris Johnson\u0026#39: Our writers discuss the PM\u0026#39s futureMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mary beard tells cheered toppling colston lifestyle depends","story":"People who cheered the toppling of Edward Colston’s statue should confront the fact that their own lifestyles rely on modern slavery, Prof Mary Beard has said.The academic and television presenter said she initially felt a “thrill” when the statue of the slave trader was pulled down and thrown into Bristol’s harbour in June 2020.However, she now believes the issue is more “complicated”.Prof Beard has made a new BBC documentary series, Forbidden Art, in which she tackles censorship and controversy.“I confess in the programme - or boast - I felt a thrill,” she said of watching the statue being torn down.“I thought this had been a controversial statue for years, if not decades, and there was a bit of old-fashioned ‘public taking things into their own hands’ political protest here.“I have to say, I thought it was exciting and the right thing to do at the time. I’m not going to reject that thrill I had.”However, she went on: “Since then I’ve come to see a greater complexity to this, and in particular how the spotlight in these kinds of things is not just on Colston or any other unacceptable subject of statuary. I think the spotlight also comes down to us.“As I reflected back on my own thrill, I also realised I was sitting there with my smartphone, tweeting away and enjoying the moment, and had it crossed my mind that my smartphone was made in conditions - I don’t know if you want to call them modern slavery - but we know the exploitative conditions in which the things we rely on are made.“And I came to think that, in some ways, Colston and our feelings about him also had to work as a challenge to us.”Prof Beard said she wondered if our failure to consider what happens in foreign factories “is much the same as Colston’s sense, that we don’t really see things that are happening a very, very long way away”.She added: “Maybe we ought to look harder at ourselves… As well as deploring Colston, we might look at our own weak spots and we might wonder, I suppose, if our heroes will be toppled long after we’re dead, in a couple of hundred years’ time.“What are our faults, that will bring opprobrium onto us?”Last month, four people who admitted toppling the Colston statue walked free from court after a jury agreed that they had committed no crime.Prof Beard’s two-part series, which begins on Thursday on BBC Two, looks at art that has “challenged the political and social status quo”, including works banned by the Nazis and religious imagery.“These debates are not new. As long as there have been works of art, there have been works of art that people wanted to destroy or not see or pull down,” said Prof Beard.“We need to be a bit careful about thinking we invented the statue wars.”More from NewsCouncils to record which children are being home schooledHeat pumps could leave householders in the cold by failing to warm homes adequatelyAfghan Christians have been abandoned\u0026#39It\u0026#39s one hour to midnight for Boris Johnson\u0026#39: Our writers discuss the PM\u0026#39s futureStatism is not the route to levelling upMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"statism not route levelling","story":"Visitors to Florence will have seen the six-ball emblem of the Medicis dotted around the city, attached to buildings financed by the family’s considerable fortune. Michael Gove alluded to this example of self-publicising 14th-century paternalism in his announcement yesterday of the Government’s “levelling up” proposals. The idea is that by bringing together innovators in one place, the Medicis unwittingly instigated the Renaissance.Mr Gove believes that by applying a similar model in England, left-behind parts of the country can be brought up to up to the standards of living seen in more prosperous regions. Boris Johnson, will also hope that investment directed towards these areas will be similarly badged to leave no doubt in the so-called Red Wall constituencies as to its provenance. Levelling up is the Prime Minister’s Big Idea for the parliament, but showing voters the benefits before the next election scheduled for 2024 will be a difficult task.Attracting entrepreneurs, businesses, arts venues, good schools, effective transport and the rest to areas that have hitherto struggled is clearly to be commended. The issue is how to do it. Top-down dispensation of taxpayers’ largesse to regions that for decades have relied disproportionately on the public sector for jobs is not the answer, although yet more public money was Labour’s demand, as it always is.The plan comprises a dozen pledges enshrined in statute to be achieved by 2030, with targets to reach certain benchmarks for improving outcomes. The political architecture to bring this about will involve greater devolution and the appointment of regional mayors with the powers to drive the agenda. As a former mayor, Mr Johnson clearly sees merit in this approach provided the right person is in charge. A mayor can act as a barrier to investment and development by pursuing anti-business policies. In London, and soon in Manchester and Bradford, “green” motoring charges are more likely to drive commerce away, not encourage it.The analysis of the UK as top-heavy is correct: London and the South East have a greater dominance in this country than almost anywhere else. But this is a function of the decline of manufacturing and the rise of services, not of state interventionism. If there is to be a renaissance in the regions they need competitive tax policies, freeports, deregulation and less, not more, government.More from NewsCouncils to record which children are being home schooledMary Beard tells those who cheered the toppling of Colston: your lifestyle depends on ‘slavery’ tooHeat pumps could leave householders in the cold by failing to warm homes adequatelyAfghan Christians have been abandoned\u0026#39It\u0026#39s one hour to midnight for Boris Johnson\u0026#39: Our writers discuss the PM\u0026#39s futureMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"7 false misleading claims boris","story":"  or misleading claims Boris Johnson made today in fiery PMQs clashAt one point the Prime Minister repeated a  claim about jobs just hours after a data watchdog begged him not to.

The CPS said he had no involvement in the decision. Meanwhile, he claimed it was wrong for the PM to insist the Tories are the party of low taxes at a time when heaposs squeezing working people to the pips. Things were so tense, Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle had to warn MPs not to accuse the PM of lying, which is unparliamentary.In his replies to Sir Keir, Boris Johnson earned roars of support from his own MPs as he trumpeted employment, GDP and wage figures.But perhaps he got a little carried away in his wording. Here are seven things he said that are either outright , or don’t stack up in context.  There are ‘more people in work than before the pandemic began’ This claim had been branded incorrect by the Office for Statistics Regulation just a day earlier in a letter to No. Director Ed Humpherson said the PM was referring to people on payrolls, but this excludes many self-employed. Mr Humpherson told Downing Street: The number of people on employer payrolls does not include everyone in work. ONS publishes data on the number of people in employment. The data for January – March  estimate that .m people were in employment compared with .m people in employment for September – November . It is therefore incorrect to state that there were more people in work at the end of this period than the start.  Tories are ‘lting the Living Wage - which this party introduced’ Tory Chancellor George Osborne introduced the National Living Wage in , but this was a rebranded version of the National Minimum Wage for over-s. That means the National Living Wage is, legally speaking, the same thing as the National Minimum Wage - which Labour introduced in . Importantly, the NLW is lower than the ‘real’ Living Wage which has been promoted for years by campaigners as the amount that meets everyday needs. The real Living Wage is currently £. or £. in London - compared to £. for the government’s National Living Wage, which will rise to £. in April. ‘In spite of all the dficulties we’ve faced, we have now got the fastest growth in the G. Absolutely true’ Technically yes, the UK’s GDP is forecast to grow by .% in  - the highest of any G country. But that is not the full picture - it also fell by .% in  according to the IMF, the worst of any G country. That means it’s now bouncing back faster too. According to the House of Commons Library, UK GDP was still down by .% in July-September  compared to pre-pandemic levels. This was the second-worst of any G country, behind Canada, Italy, Germany, the Eurozone, France and the US. The Commons Library also warned these figures are not % comparable across countries due to dferences in how output in the education and health sectors is calculated. ‘We’re getting , people off welfare and into work through our Way to Work plan’Tory ministers have set a ‘Way to Work’ target to help , Universal Credit claimants into work by June.But despite the PM’s boast, it’s thought the plan is only to get , people into jobs - not off Universal Credit. Sources told the Mirror some of those people are likely to continue claiming, at least in the short term, as around two-fths of UC claimants already have a job. They remain eligible for benefits because their wages are too low. Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves wrote a letter in April  ‘suggesting we could secure PPE supplies from a theatrical costumier and we could get ventilators from a professional football agentapos Ms Reeves did write a letter, and the firms it mentioned did include one behind ‘historic re-enactment clothing’ that was offering to make - gowns a week. However, the context is that she passed on the details of  firms that were offering to supply PPE - without actually endorsing their work.Instead her letter told Michael Gove : “You and your officials and those at the Department for Health and Social Care will be best placed to validate what capability and capacity these firms have.“But as they have not received a reply after contacting the Government, I wanted to ensure that the Cabinet Office was aware of them.” Labour insist she was simply raising concerns about the number of firms at the time that were not getting a response.  Keir Starmer ‘would have kept us in lockdown’While he didn’t specy this time, Boris Johnson has repeatedly made this claim in relation to December  when Omicron surged.The Labour leader welcomed additional measures to curb Omicron rates before Christmas  - but he had never called for a lockdown. At one point Mr Starmer said: Weaposve got a government that are hinting at further restrictions but theyaposre more concerned and tied up with party management at the moment than it is with public health. The question on my lips and I think on the publicaposs lips is where is the prime minister One time Keir Starmer definitely did demand a lockdown was in autumn  - and Boris Johnson eventually caved and obeyed those calls a few weeks later. ‘We’ve opened Freeports across the country just in the last few days’Eight successful bidders for Freeports were announced at the March  Budget.Since then they have been working up their plans. Teesside opened in November and Thames in mid-December. But when we asked the government today, we were told the other six are yet to open. Neither the Mirror nor officials we asked could find evidence of new Freeports opening in the last month or so.

Ministers said the missions include “improving wellbeing in every area” of the UK, a devolution deal for every part of England that wants one, and bringing public transport connectivity across the country “signicantly closer to the standards of London”.Levelling-Up Secretary Michael Gove also raised the prospect of the House of Lords moving out of London. “I think it’d be a really good thingthe House of Lords were to meet for at least part of the time in Glasgow or in York,” he told Times Radio. But Labour said all of the pledges so far have been recycled pots of money and not what we were promised.Here, we look at some of the things announced by the government, and give our verdict on what they really mean.  Schools They say: “By , the number of primary schoolchildren achieving the expected standard in reading, writing and maths will have increased.”Our verdict: The government has set a new goal of ensuring that % of schoolchildren will have reached the national standard, but in , the figure was %.Ministers have identied  communities for intensive additional support and they are largely outside of London. Quite how “intensive” this support will be delivered is also not clear.  Housing What they are promising: Improve the quality of rented homes and bring in the National Landlord Register to aid tenants. The green belt will be protected and first-time buyers will increase.Verdict: Alicia Kennedy of the Generation Rent campaign group welcomed the National Landlord Register and pledge to end no-fault evictions.But there is no extra money to build more affordable housing. No is stoking the property market by helping people get a foot on the ladder rather than investing in social housing. Mayors What they say: “By , every part of England that wants one will have a devolution deal with powers at or approaching the highest level of devolution and a simplied, long-term funding settlement.”Our verdict: Critics have hit out at the Tories’ piecemeal approach to devolving power so far, with cities having more controls than neighbouring areas, as well as the benefit of mayors such as Andy Burnham acting as national champions. The fear now is that doing deals with each area in turn could achieve the opposite of an “end to the postcode lottery”. Health and wellbeing What they say: By , the gap in Healthy Le Expectancy between local areas where it is highest and lowest will have narrowed, and by  HLE will rise by five years.Our verdict: The latest ONS data showed that the UK overall had seen the first fall in le expectancy in  years. Researchers recently found a -year gap between the le expectancy of a man living in Kensington and Cha and Blackpool. The Health Foundation says the Government “faces a massive challenge”, with funds needed to tackle smoking, obesity and NHS improvement.Crime What they are promising: By  homicide, serious violence and neighbourhood crime will have fallen, focused on the worst-affected areas.There will be , more police officers on our streets by  and a £million Safer Streets Fund to improve the environment and cut offending in high-crime areas. Verdict: There is a question mark over whether these targets can be hit. Under the Tories police officers fell from , to ,.Despite a vow to recruit , more, there are now ,. In the year to March  there was a % rise in homicides and % rise in kne crime. Latest figures show fewer than one in  crimes are solved. Transport What they say: “By , local public transport connectivity across the country will be signicantly closer to the standards of London, with improved services, simpler fares and integrated ticketing.”Our verdict: Towns and cities outside of the capital require dferent transport solutions to the economic powerhouse that is the UK’s capital, with buses and creaking rail lines badly in need of investment.The Government says the plan will take in £.billion for city regions UK-wide and £bn for the integrated rail plan. But already, promises of £bn for bus services appear to be roughly half of the cash promised, with ministers to focus on “bus improvements in areas where this can make the most impact”. The £bn integrated rail plan, meanwhile, has been watered down with the key £bn plan for Leeds to Manchester to be delivered through upgrades on the existing transpennine track, rather than a new line through Bradford.  Sports and culture What they are promising: A £bn Culture Recovery Fund for museums, theatres, cinemas and heritage groups. More Arts Council cash to go outside London. Extra support for grassroots sports.Verdict: All of these measures have been previously announced. The Culture Recovery Fund was part of the pandemic package to help venues during lockdown.While more money from the Arts Council will go to regions, its budget has not been increased. The £m for new football pitches was unveiled last June. Broadband What they are promising: By , the UK will have nationwide gigabit-capable broadband and G coverage, with G coverage for most of the population.Verdict: Not only a re-announcement – it’s actually a delay. Ministers already said they were investing £billion in G coverage, aiming to have it across most of the UK by . Now it’s . MPs on the Public Accounts Committee warn the goal of full coverage does not include more than , remote homes.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSHouse of LordsHealth Trust Inc.Andy BurnhamMichael GoveEnergy billsFirst-time buyersLe expectancyPublic transportCrimePoliticsLevelling Up WatchDaily Mirror\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Former Education Secretary Gavin Williamson pushed for a ban on mobiles last year, which he said were “not just distracting but they can have a damaging effect on a pupil’s mental health and wellbeing”. The move drew criticism from teaching unions, who branded it a distraction from wider issues facing schools after the pandemic.His successor Nadhim Zahawi has now stepped back from a blanket ban with revised guidance for heads, which will be consulted on from today. Children who are not in school will also be listed on a new register in an attempt to stop pupils falling through the cracks. Local authorities will be told to log where each child is being educated after a rise in children being home-schooled during the pandemic.Mr Zahawi said:While the majority of children already learn in a calm and well-maintained classroom, and some learn at home with dedicated parents, there are areas across the country where high standards are not being met.As Education Secretary, it is my priority to make sure every child gets the start in le they deserve, which is why Iaposm announcing clearer guidance to help every school boost behaviour and new legislation to create the first local authority register for children not in school. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , welcomed the introduction of a register for children not in school - but branded new guidance on behaviour unhelpful.  He said: We need to remember that in the vast majority of schools there are no major issues when it comes to behaviour, and that schools already have strong systems in place for supporting good behaviour. The Governmentaposs current obsession with being seen to apostalk toughapos on behaviour is frankly unhelpful. Instead, what the Government should be focusing on is making sure that vital support services are available to support schools and pupils when they need it. It is important to find outthere is an underlying cause for an inidual childaposs behaviour, whether it be mental wellbeing, undiagnosed SEND, or problems at home. Geoff Barton, General Secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: We are relieved to see that the Education Secretary clearly doesn’t share his predecessor’s obsession with the use of mobile phones in classrooms. He appears to have accepted what we told Gavin Williamson at the time, namely that schools and colleges already have rigorous policies in place on mobile phone use and should be left to get on with the job at hand.

The UK and the EU agreed that goods from Great Britain must be checked at Northern Irelandaposs ports to ensure they comply with EU laws. But Mr Poots argued the checks are unlawful after seeking legal advice. Speaking at Stormont, Mr Poots said: I have now issued a formal instruction to my permanent secretary to halt all checks that were not in place on December   from midnight tonight.  I will prepare a paper for Executive consideration in the near future to seek agreement on a way forward. But it is unclear whether the senior civil servant in his department will comply with the order. Northern Irelandaposs Deputy First Minister Michelle OaposNeill branded the decision a stunt. She said: This stunt is an attempt by the DUP to unlawfully interfere with domestic, and international law. DUP fixated on their own priorities, which are clearly at odds with where the wider community is at. The move comes amid ongoing tensions between the EU and the UK over a key part of the Brexit deal, known as the Northern Ireland protocol. The protocol was designed to prevent ato violence on the island of Ireland by avoiding a land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Island. Instead, a trade border was effectively created in the Irish Sea. Mr Johnson has spent most of the past two years trying to tear apart the Brexit deal he negotiated to reduce these checks, which have caused red tape and delays for businesses and consumers in Northern Ireland.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has taken over the negotiations following the resignation of Brexit Minister Lord Frost, who repeatedly threatened to unilaterally tear up the deal.The DUP are opposed to the NI protocol, as they fear it means Northern Ireland is treated dferently to the rest of the UK.

Treasury insiders denied that Mr Johnson had set a precedent that other ministers should follow.  They said Mr Sunak had felt it was important to be visible and supportive of the Government on the day Sue Gray published an update of her report. The Chancellor later attended a crowded meeting of the Toriesapos backbench  committee in a show of solidarity with his beleaguered boss. And he led Treasury questions in the House of Commons chamber on Tuesday.  Mr Sunak, who was one of the only ministers wearing a facemask on the frontbench, tested negative before the Commons statement.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, sitting on Ms Patelaposs other side, later tested positive for Covid and was forced to miss her trip to the Ukraine with the PM. The legal requirement to stay at homeyou have a positive case in your household is no longer in place.But official NHS guidance still “strongly advises” people to limit close contact with others in crowded spaces and work from homepossible.It states that they should limit close contact with other people outside your household, especially in crowded, enclosed or poorly ventilated spaces. The advice adds that people should work from homeyou are able to and wear a face-covering in crowded places. A spokesman for Mr Sunak said: The Chancellor has followed the legal requirements to the letter. “He has taken daily lateral flow tests and has limited his social contact where possible, whilst also ensuring that he is able to continue to conduct important Government and Parliamentary business as the public would expect.  Just last month, No  announced Mr Johnson was unlikely to be seen in public for a week after a member of his immediate family, later revealed to be baby Romy, tested positive for Covid. The PMaposs official spokesman said he would heed official guidance to limit outside contacts as much as possible for seven days after the test. “In line with the guidance, he’s reducing contact, he told reporters. He’ll be working from No , doing daily tests and limiting contact with others both outside No  and indeed inside No  as well, having limited contact with others in the building, and conducting meetings online.” However, Mr Johnson faced accusations he was hiding behind the illness, as it came while he faced intense scrutiny over his attendance at a BYOB garden party in No  during lockdown. The PM cancelled a visit to a vaccination centre in Lancashire, where he would have faced tough media questions, while a Downing Street press conference was also axed.

While the -page report has been subbed down to just , it contains all the facts needed to decide the PMaposs future. Extensive, substantive, factual information is now available, wrote Sue Gray. There were failures of leadership and judgement. There was excessive consumption of alcohol. There was no way for those working in government to stop it breaking the law. There was a serious failure to observe, not just the standards expected of those working at the heart of government, but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.The killer line is in paragraph . The excuse of long hours worked in the pandemic, in a building that could not be entirely Covid-secure, was destroyed. Those challenges... also applied to key and frontline workers across the country who were working under equally,not more, demanding conditions, often at risk to their own health... criminal sanctions were applied to many... the hardship under which citizens across the country worked, lived and sadly even died while observing the Governmentaposs regulations and guidance are known only too well.

A suspected serial killer who evaded police for decades was given the nickname Toy Box Killer after kitting out a trailer with torture devices and holding women as \"sex slaves\"David Parker Rayand his lawyer Jeff Rein at the  trial Image: Getty ImagesByJessica TaylorReal Le Features Writer:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsCynthia Vigil was just  years old when she was arrested by an undercover cop for soliciting sex illegally in a car park in . But after she was handcuffed by the mysterious officer, it didnapost take long for Cynthia to realise something was seriously wrong. Before she could resist, Cynthia was tasered, drugged and blindfolded. When she woke up, she was chained to a bed. This was when it became clear to the then sex worker that she hadnapost been arrested - sheaposd been abducted. The man who had kidnapped Cynthia was David Parker Ray, a sadistic serial rapist and torturer - who is suspected to have killed several women in his home state of New Mexico, US. Ray, who kept diaries including details of his victims, owned a repurposed trailer that heaposd soundproofed and kitted out with torture devices. And when his depraved crimes were finally revealed, they horried the community around him. Early le of a monster Ray, born in , was primarily raised by his grandparents who were believed to have run a strict, religious household. Growing up, Ray and his sister Peggy were sporadically visited by their violent, alcoholic father.  As the siblings grew up in a tiny rural town, Peggy became a popular, outgoing girl - while Ray remained shy and something of a loner. Although he didnapost have many friends at school and spent lots of time on his own, Ray wasnapost considered a troublemaker but showed signs of weird behaviour in childhood. From an early age heaposs believed to have taken an interest in pornography and violence, which he hid from those around him. It is also reported that Ray developed a fetish for broken bottles, keeping a stash of them in a dungeon heaposd built in the woods when he was . But after reaching adolescence, he lived a seemingly normal le and joined the US Army, receiving an honourable discharge at the end of his enlistment. Family and fatherhood Over the years Ray married several times and fathered lots of children, but he abandoned his families and only really bonded with a daughter he had - Glenda Jean Ray. Described as a Daddyaposs girl, Glenda Jean idolised her father and the pair were incredibly close as she got older. Their bond was even more unusual given that Ray had abandoned Glenda Jean, her mother and her siblings when they were young to live on the road and eventually adopt a hippy lestyle.  But just a few years later, he ed to Glenda Jeanaposs mum, who took him back. As Rayaposs beloved daughter developed into an adult she was tall, slim and blonde - looking much like a younger version of her dad. She also changed her name several times, going by Jessy to most people she knew. The relationship between Ray and Jessyaposs mum lasted another decade before he moved on to other women - including Cindy Hendy, who became his accomplice. The aposToy Boxapos To carry out his sick crimes, Ray bought an old trailer and converted it into a Toy Box, which included soundproofing and installing a gynaecological chair to strap victims into. The ceiling of the trailer was lined with mirrors, meaning the victims watched in horror at the torture he was inflicting on them. The rest of the Toy Box was kitted out with chains, whips, straps, clamps, saws and sex toys. Perhaps most disturbingly, the walls of the torture chamber were adorned with diagrams showing dferent methods of inflicting pain.  Ray is thought to have had several accomplices who helped him commit his unthinkable crimes, including friends and even girlfriends. When he was finally caught and the FBI raided the trailer, they found disturbing audio tapes heaposd recorded in which he told victims what was about to happen to them. One recording recovered reportedly told a victim she was going to be raped thoroughly and repeatedly, telling her she was a sex slave. Cynthiaaposs escape After kidnapping an unknown number of victims, Ray was finally caught in  when Cynthia Vigil escaped the Toy Box. She had spent three days chained to the gynaecologistaposs table in the torture trailer by Ray and three accomplices - girlfriend Cindy, daughter Jessy and friend Dennis Yancy. Seizing her opportunity for freedom after Ray had gone to work, Cynthia managed to grab the keys to her chains after Cindy left them on a nearby table. While she was unlocking herself, Cindy walked back into the room and a fight broke out between the two. But Cynthia managed to stab Hendy in the neck with an ice pick and make her escape.  Completely naked save for chains and a dog collar and covered in Cindyaposs blood, Cynthia fled and tried to flag down a passing car, before finding a house she considered safe and running inside. The homeowner covered her up and called the police. When they arrived, Cynthia recalled the gruesome tale and led cops to the location of the trailer. Ray and Hendy were swtly arrested - leading two other women to come forward claiming they had also been kidnapped and tortured by the sadist. Police investigations identied Jessy and Dennis Yancy as accomplices to the crimes - with Yancy admitting to murdering his girlfriend Marie Parker after Ray had kidnapped and tortured her. Trials and death Rayaposs attacks were separated into three trials for each woman who came forward against him. After the first trial had to be repeated, Ray was convicted of  counts of torture and sexual assault. The victim in the second trial sadly died before she could see justice, meaning no verdict was ever made. Eventually in , Ray was sentenced to  years in prison for ious offences in the abduction and torture of his victims. He was soon dubbed the Toy Box Killer as cops believed he was responsible for up to  murders - but no bodies relating to his crimes were ever recovered. Jessy Ray was given a sentence of nine years while Cindy Hendy was given  years in prison. On  May , Ray was taken to a facility in New Mexico to be questioned by state police. Shortly before the interrogation took place, he had a heart attack and died. Since managing to escape from the Toy Box, Cynthia Vigil has gone on to have a family, but she has shared her story in the hope other victims of evil Ray will come forward. Recalling her ordeal to reporters in , she said: This was a very sick man. The only thing that gives me any comfort is that he’s gone. If I didn’t get away, I wouldn’t have my three wonderful boys. I wouldn’t be here.

The only way to solve the problem was to dig up the ground floor of the Hampshire house and remove hundreds of metres of bamboo rhizomes. The home insurance claim for the damage was apparently more than £,, reports the Express.Japanese Knotweed is famously a nightmare, but experts have said bamboo can be just as baditaposs left to grow unmonitored. The roots of bamboo can travel up to a whopping  metres and they can break through all sorts of surfaces, from bricks and drains to cavity walls and patios.  aposRunningapos ieties of bamboo like the one found at the Hampshire property are particularly prolic as they send lateral shoots out underneath the ground which can sometimes pop up on neighboursapos plots. Founder and MD of Environet UK, Nic Seal, told the Sun: Through no fault of their own, the homeowners have suffered signicant financial cost, stress and inconvenience, being required to vacate their home for several months. The truth is, most bamboos are invasiveplanted directly into the ground and left to their own devices. He added that the Hampshire case was the worst case of bamboo encroachment heaposd ever seen in this country. Experts advise itaposs best to choose a clumping iety of bamboo rather than a running iety to avoid spreading problems like these. Those buying bamboo should also plant it in a pot instead of in the ground and make sure to trim it frequently.

This will not be tolerated.Bradford Police have launched an undercover operation to combat catcallingImage: Getty Images AlloyopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Feb |commentsIt probably seems like a small thing, at best. At worst, a waste of time and resources. It’s not though. It’s important. A tiny triumph. A baby step in the right direction. Bradford Police have launched an undercover operation to combat catcalling – “targeting people who are shouting things from their vehicles at women girls. This will not be tolerated.” Last week they stopped a van after the occupant yelled at some women who turned out to be plain-clothed police officers. Oh to have seen his face. He was reported for a breach of the Public Spaces Protection Order and is likely to be issued with a £ fine or taken to court, which is another way of saying that he was left in no doubt that THIS IS NOT OK. That’s apparently what men need to be told, reminded of, in no uncertain terms, so they’re one hundred per cent clear. No, it’s not just a bit of harmless fun that we need to lighten up about. It’s horrendous. Scary. Humiliating.  Maybe this concept is confusing because we’re living in an age of sharing, honesty, and talking about everything. Mostly that’s great, but somewhere within this, a simple truth has got lost. Sometimes, it’s good NOT to talk. Sometimes, you need to shut the hell up. Perhaps we need a massive advertising campaign, public service announcement telly commercials and posters everywhere to clearly inform everyone once and for all: Stop telling women what you think of their bodies. Especially when they haven’t asked, which is pretty much always. There are no Thought Police – anyone is free to think whatever they like. The opinions inside someone’s head can’t hurt anyone . The problem comes when they’re broadcast out loud to the woman you’re thinking them about, be it on the street, online, or on a radio show, like that fool who talked about Strictly’s Tilly Ramsay. What you think of the woman’s body is irrelevant, by the way. Evenyou believe it’s a compliment, still keep it to yourself. Of course there are exceptions to the rule, but most women do not feel flattered and delighted when a stranger gives them positive feedback about a body part. We feel embarrassed, and frightened. And we’re taught to ignore this behaviour – apart from in Bradford, it’s up to us to deal with it ourselves – to put our heads down, walk quicker, in case the situation escalates.We’re luckywe are only verbally harassed. Even online, where the threat of physical violence is removed, these kind of comments are dangerous, and unacceptable. They perpetuate the belief that women’s appearances are fair game for discussion and debate. That our bodies are anyone’s business but our own. They also ensure that the practice of speaking about women in this way seeps down to future generations, continuing the cycle. It has to stop. As the fight to make our streets safer for women goes on, catcalling being taken seriously in one city in the UK is just a drop in the ocean. But at least it’s a start. Maybe those TV ads aren’t a bad idea – and it’s obvious what music they should be set to. Ronan Keating, You Say It Best, When You Say Nothing At All.

Prosecutor Sara Anthony told Cheltenham Magistrates Court that a year ago Awdry was disqualied for le from owning, keeping, transporting or being in any way involved with dogs. The ban was imposed in February  at Gloucester Crown Court after Awdry and two other defendants were convicted for selling puppies without a licence, and failing to meet the needs of the animals. The puppies were kept in squalid conditions at Awdryaposs home and were poorly looked after. Awdry and his two accomplices were estimated to have made £, from puppy farming over four years. Yesterday, Ms Anthony told the court that the Forest of Dean District Council was tipped off that Awdry was still using dogs for work and had been seen transporting his dogs about, shortly after his dog ban was imposed. On April ,  at .am two members of the councilaposs street warden team were in the Bream area and were travelling along Oakwood Road when they spotted Awdry in a white Nissan vehicle beside a five bar gate,” Ms Anthony said. “They both had a clear view of a black and white Collie sitting on the front passenger seat. They watched Awdry turn the vehicle around and drive to the other side of the field and park alongside an outbuilding. They both saw Awdry unload two Collie dogs from the vehicle and usher them towards the outbuilding. Awdry was then observed ing to his vehicle without the dogs. Awdry drove down Highfield Close and disappeared from the area. The street wardens checked the outbuilding and observed that the two dogs were inside. While the wardens were making notes of what they had just witnessed Awdry ed in his van accompanied by his we. He parked beside the outbuilding and opened the door while Mrs Awdry encouraged the dogs into the vehicle from the passenger side. Awdry ed to the vehicle and drove off. On the second occasion the district council was contacted by PC Katherine McDay who was driving in a marked vehicle from Coleford to Bream on May  last year at around pm when she noticed Awdryaposs Nissan van on the B near the area of Bream Cross. She noticed a large amount of sheep coming from a field opposite. Pc McDay travelled past the Nissan and turned around. While she travelled back towards the van she noticed that Awdry was driving and his we was in the passenger seat with a black Collie dog on her lap. As Pc McDay passed she noticed that the dog was released out of the passenger door and it began herding sheep along the road. A short while later she noticed Awdry drive away from the area and saw that the sheep were no longer visible. The dog had its head out of the passenger window. Clive Rees, defending, said: I feel that Awdry did not fully understand the rules surrounding the disqualication order. He was under the impression thathe had somebody with him who was responsible for the dogs he would be complying with the terms of the order. Awdry had already transferred ownership of the dogs to his we. He has kept dogs all his le and, being a commoner, he has the right to roam sheep on the common. He frequently gets calls from police to remove them from the road, eventhey are not his own sheep. When the order was initially issued Awdry would get his we to drive his van with the dogs. However over the past few months Mrs Awdryaposs health has deteriorated and she has recently lost much of her eyesight and most of her hearing. Mr Awdry has become her carer. Awdry started the order with good intentions. His son has now taken over the responsibility for the dogs. Whoever saw the dogs, there was no mention of them being concerned about the animalsapos welfare. In the future Awdry will have to come to terms about not looking after sheep in future. He realises now that he is in a serious position. He should have known the position when he was sentenced at Gloucester Crown Court. Awdry pleaded guilty to breaching a disqualication order imposed after conviction on two occasions. On or around April ,  at Lydney, having been previously disqualied from keeping dogs he transported two black and white collie dogs inside a white Nissan white van, and on May ,  he transported a black and white collie dog inside the same van whilst directing  sheep to exit a field and move along the B Rd heading towards Bream. Presiding Justice Major Paul Adey sentenced Awdry to six weeks imprisonment for the two offences of transporting dogs and activated the  week suspended sentence consecutively. We note that the dogs are no longer in your and Mrs Awdryaposs ownership, a move which should have been undertaken  months ago, said the magistrate. “We also acknowledge that the dogs have not been mistreated whilst they have been in your care. The justices ordered that outstanding court costs of £, and the £, costs of yesterdayaposs case must be paid by Awdry by th April this year. After yesterdayaposs hearing Forest of Dean District Councilaposs Animal Welfare Member Champion, Councillor Nicky Packer said Our Street Warden team do a fantastic job year round of ensuring that animals in our district are looked after properly, and that those who mistreat or cause harm to their animals are held accountable.” This verdict should stand as testament to this. A ban on keeping dogs means exactly that. If, as in this case, it isnapost followed, our Street Warden and Counter Fraud and Enforcement team will enforce it. A council spokesperson added The prosecution was undertaken by Forest of Dean District Councilaposs Legal Services team working with the Councilaposs Street Wardens Team and Counter Fraud and Enforcement Unit .

Desperate to keep her children warm, Beth bundles them up in jumpers and scarves at home - but Tommy, who is autistic, struggles to wear the outfits. She says: “We’re wearing a lot of extra layers and having to sleep in the same bed to keep warm. “I shut the bedroom door to keep our body heat in but as soon as we got downstairs, it is freezing and we’re all shivering. “It’s a very old draughty cottage, I woke up the other morning around  am to find ice around the windowsill. “We’re wearing a lot more clothes, which means a lot more washing and a backlog of clothes as we wait days for things to dry. “It’s also a choice when it comes to hot water -the kids have a bath, I can’t have a shower as well.” She added: “I have no money and I’m worried about the kids getting ill because it is so cold. “February and March can be the coldest months so I needed to get something done quickly.” Tommy, aged five, is “very delayed” and has to wear specic clothes, meaning he doesn’t like wearing the extra layers.Beth is unable to work after becoming his full-time carer due to his severe epilepsy and the family rely on Universal Credit to get by.She previously tried to get a loan but was refused as she still owes around £ from the last loan she received. “I’ve tried everything.

Le will never be the same without him.” Jonathanaposs brother Josh added: We might not have always seen eye to eye but we always had each othersapos backs. Thataposs just family and the power of caring for someone no matter what. In our younger days we were the all time partners of all mischief. Car badges, dust caps, hot wheels and the sweet aisles in any shop never stood a chance. Danielle said her family had been “touched by everyone” after hundreds of tributes were paid to Jonathan on social media. One comment read: “Absolutely gutted to hear this awful news. JT was a lovely caring young man with a massive heart. He used to tell us jokes and then laugh, sometimes leaving me a little confused. I didn’t always get them but his laugh made me laugh and smile.” Another wrote: “A real lovely guy who will be sadly missed by many. RIP Jonathan. Youaposll always be remembered with great fondness.” Jonathan’s funeral will be held on Friday, February , at St Mary’s Church in Caldicot.*If youaposre struggling and need to talk, the Samaritans operate a free helpline open   on  .

Tests continued tonegative and the family felt nobody could explain what was wrong with him. Brian was found aposunable to moveapos on May  last year after bending down to wash his hands. Little did we know that our world was about to be blown apart, Alyson said. My dad suddenly was unable to move and we had to call an ambulance. It came to light that my dadaposs femur and hip had split open but there was no logical reason for this he hadnapost banged himself or had a fall. On the May  after much investigation it came to light that my dad had myeloma and was very poorly. He wasnapost even awake so I couldn’t tell him how much I loved him and that he had to fight. The next day, Alyson said she had to discuss a do-not-resuscitate order with her fatheraposs consultant. What a shocker, she said, we only found out about the cancer the day before and he only came into hospital  days before that. How can things be this bad so quick  May  was one of the worst days of our le, Alyson continued. We got a call to say come in, Dad wasnapost going to be pulling through, and would not make the weekend. To this point we had all been restricted to seeing my dad because of Covid but now we were allowed to be by his side. I cannot emphasise what a shock this week had been to us all. How quick the tide had turned in our le. What I can tell you is from my own point of view the heart-breaking pain I felt, Iaposd never felt pain like it and it was like I could not breathe and my world had crashed into a million pieces.  Sadly, a lot of families go through this journey leading to their diagnosis. Another reason why knowledge, awareness, training and earlier diagnosis is so important. Myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that occurs in the bone marrow. It currently affects more than , people in the UK. On average,  people are diagnosed with Myeloma every day in the UK. Alyson said: My dad had fallen sick in October  and despite many tests ran nothing came to light. Even a few weeks before May st, Dad had more tests done and still nothing had shown up, even in the blood tests for cancer. Going back through my dadaposs medical history it is now thought that his myeloma could go back  years when it was at the apossmoulderingapos stage but right up to him being hospitalised nothing ever came to light. The myeloma had remained undetected. Another reason why a better diagnosis system needs to be found. Despite being told he had just days to live, Brian went home in July - a day that Alyson says is one they never thought we would see. Brian is said to have responded well to chemotherapy - but the damage done to his body cannot be reversed. He is on chemotherapy every day to give him some extra time. Another dficult side to Myeloma is that it does y from person to person and besides the cancer, myeloma can come with many other complications. For my dad it is his heart and lungs. Now Alyson and husband Alan, who run Alan Yates Music, are planning to do weekly gigs throughout March this year in a bid to fund the research into a cure for Myeloma.Alyson is immunocompromised, meaning her immune system is extremely weak and she is at higher risk of contracting Covid-.Myeloma may become curable but funds are required for that and funds are required to help those in today’s society where there isnapost a cure, she said. She said she wanted to support Myeloma UK to help fund research into a cure and to raise awareness of Myeloma so “it doesn’t happen to anybody . We went through a horrendous journey as a family and the thought of another family going through that… I just can’t”. Myeloma UK is the only organisation in the UK exclusively dedicated to Myeloma and its related conditions. They rely almost entirely on voluntary donations and fundraising. Their ultimate goal is to find a cure for Myeloma and until then aim to help every patient live well with the diagnosis for as long as possible.To find out more about myeloma and the work of Myeloma UK click here.

The Duchess of Sussex is said to have made a comment about the royal le she was about to embark on, in front of her new family at her wedding to Prince Harry in . In their unofficial biography, Finding Freedom, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand highlighted how Meghan hadn’t spoken in public before their big day. According to the authors of the book, it was a first for a royal bride and reinforced the notion that she is no typical duchess. They wrote: A first for a royal bride, the move reinforced the idea that this American was no typical duchess.

And sheaposs respected that. aposShe does have a lot of respect for the family and the institution that she has joined. Bit itaposs just a dferent way of living. Weaposd missed hearing her speakapos. And apparently Meghan felt the same way, because she laughed, aposI know itaposs been a whileapos. During her speech, the new Duchess of Sussex thanked the Queen for welcoming her into the family with open arms and Prince Charles for stepping in at the last minute and walking her down the aisle. According to Us Weekly, it was also believed that she made reference to her orce from Trevor Engelson, and affirmed that finding love was worth the wait. She went on to brand Prince Harry as the one.

When they rushed to help they were shocked to discover it was a one-year-old terrier cross, who was malnourished and dirty. The pup, who has now been named Freya, was wrapped in a towel by Deborah Hollingdale, who watched the scene unfold. She said: The woman in the car behind saw an arm stick out of the driveraposs window and threw something out as they were going about pmh. She thought it was a teddy bear at first, then she saw it was a dog which ran onto my drive. I found her, she wasnapost making any noise. The first thing I noticed was that she looked starved. She was just skin and bones, you could see her hip bones poking through. Her fur was matted, she was covered in her own mess and she smelt terrible. It was clear she had been living in her own filth.  Deborah rushed the injured dog to a local vet for immediate emergency treatment and has since visited to check on her recovery. She added: Sheaposs still very thin, sheaposs getting lots of small meals to help build her up gradually. She gave me a little lick when she saw me, it broke my heart. Iaposm so thankful she survived being thrown out of that van. Given the state she was in I donapost think sheaposd have survived much longer living in the conditions she was being kept. Vets alerted the RSPCA, who are now investigating, after finding Freya was underweight, suffering from fleas and had a matted, dirty coat. Inspector Kirsten Ormerod, of the animal welfare charity, said: Freya was incredibly lucky to survive after being hurled from the moving vehicle at such a high speed and vets were incredibly concerned that she may have suffered internal bleeding so performed surgery immediately. for our daily newsletter to keep up to date with all the essential information atwww.mirror email.Vets are monitoring her closely and have given her pain relief and I am keeping everything crossed that she pulls through after experiencing such callous cruelty. Witnesses described her being thrown with such force that she landed on the opposite side of the road, and the vehicle didnapost stop or even slow down. Weaposre following up some lines of enquiry in the local area but Iaposm really keen to hear from any other witnesses who saw what happened or has any additional information about the vehicle, the people who were travelling in the truck, or Freya herself. The RSPCA has released adorable pictures of Freya, who is not microchipped and had no identication tag, with a sparkly bandage around her left paw in a bid to find who harmed her. Anyone who recognises the black and tan curly-haired pooch, saw the truck, or has CCTV or dash-cam footage from the area, is urged to contact the RSPCA.

This will have a devasting impact on workers and their families. “Meanwhile transporting finished products from sites in Europe back to the UK - where they are consumed - will result in signicant additional road and sea miles increasing pollution and environmental damage.  “GMB and Unite will now speak to members in Fawdon and find out what they want to do next.

Although the monarchy has now changed to put sons and daughters on an equal footing in terms of ascending to the throne, British primogeniture law has not been changed for peers such as dukes and earls.This means Louis will inherit Althorp rather than his oldest sister Kitty, who married -year-old businessman Michael Lewis in a grand ceremony in Italy last year.In a previous interview, Kitty, , said: Primogeniture can be a tricky topic because as times are changing, attitudes are as well. Weaposve grown up understanding that itaposs Louis to inherit, and Louis will do an incredible job.

It was bought for just £ in  by the airportaposs chief executive Suzannah Harvey when British Airways retired its fleet early due to the pandemic, and has been a labor of love ever since. Suzannah said: I paid a pound for her, and we have a certain obligation to maintain it as is practical for public use. The company has had to spend nearly £, getting her prepped and ready here, but I think itaposs money well spent and it preserves her for future generations.  Most of the original structure has stayed the same but the transformation has included stripping out the economy section to create the events space and turning the gallery into a bar.

Despite the backlash, headteacher Brian Mulheran, of the Citipointe Christian College, has doubled down and given parents an extra two weeks to sign their children up. The contract was sent to families last Friday and said the college will only enrol the student on the basis of the gender that corresponds to their biological sex. It also asserted that homosexuality, along with bestiality, incest and paedophilia, was sinful. One teacher, who also has a student at the college, has already resigned saying young people within the LGBTQ+ community deserve to feel safe while at school. Helen Clapham Burns was also a teacher at the school in Carindale, Australia, but quit on Monday saying she couldnapost continue to work for a school that would do that to children.  Mrs Burns said: Iaposm heartbroken. I feel like Iaposve let them down that Iaposm having to leave. But I have to let those queer kids know that there are Christians out there that love them and arenapost hiding behind Bible verses and are letting them know that they are safe with me. As an educator, my priority is to make sure that each child that I interact with feels safe. When a child tells us, with tears in their eyes, that they donapost feel safe, what are we doing  Mr Mulheran made a video for parents about the contract. In it he said he had listened to their concerns and wanted them to make the right decisions for themselves. The declaration of faith has been in place for the whole of last year, he said.  We want families to consider this ethos so that they can make the right decisions for themselves. He added: We have always held these Christian beliefs and we have tried to be fair and transparent to everyone in our community by making them clear in the enrolment contract. We are seeking to maintain our Christian ethos and to give parents and students the right to make an informed choice about whether they can support and embrace our approach to Christian education. Citipointe does not judge students on their sexuality or gender identity and we would not make a decision about their enrolment in the College simply on that basis.  A group of parents has said they want to file a complaint to the Human Rights Commission, arguing they were not consulted about the contract and that the college was discriminating against students on the basis of sexuality and gender identity. One parent who is asked not to be named said: The contract they put out is so blatantly damaging to anyone within the school who identies within the LGBTQI umbrella are not of their highest concern. But nor is anybody  who believes in standing up against this kind of discrimination, because the contract makes it clear that any kind of act that goes against this belief is something that can be disciplined. Federal Member for Moncref, Angie Bell, told ABC Radio in Brisbane she disagreed with the college lumping students who are unsure about their sexuality or unsure about their gender identity ... with the likes paedophiles and adulterers. No school child should be discriminated against based on their sexual orientation, their gender identity, their pregnancy status, or their relationship status, which are the four elements that are in that section of the Sex Discrimination Act, she said.Religious organisations also have the right to practise their faith … without a doubt … notitaposs done in a discriminatory fashion. This is not  anymore … this is a new year, this is a new decade, this is a new Australia and there is no room.

But when she started dated one of the worldaposs most eligible bachelors, Prince Harry, she was determined to keep things quiet while she worked outhe was The One.The couple successfully kept their relationship a secret for five months, flying between Canada and London to see each other, enjoying cosy nights in at his Kensington Palace cottage. But they knew it was only a matter of time before their perfect, private bubble burst. When news that Harry had been secretly dating the Suits star was leaked, they had only a few hours to prepare before it appeared on the front pages.  But the realisation that this was aposher new leapos, terried Meghan, claims royal journalists, Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand. In their unofficial biography Finding Freedom, the authors share details of what happened on the night the couple were told their time in hiding was up.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. They wrote: One night late in October in Toronto, Harry was happy, and so was Meghan. Until their received a call from one of Harryaposs aides at Kensington Palace. It wasnapost good news. A tabloid was going to run with the story of their relationship. Their main worry was that her place would be besieged by photographers within  hours. They had little time to think because there was only a couple of paparazzi in Toronto but it wouldnapost be long before photographers flew in from New York and LA, all hoping to get that first picture of the happy couple. Harry was inundated with calls from staff who encouraged him toto London as soon as possible since he had a smaller security team than normal. But, he refused to leave. Scobie and Durand claim that while Meghan was nervous about what was to come, she was relieved that the secrecy and lies to friends and family would be coming to an end. They said: Prior to meeting Harry, the only times she experiences cameras were on a set or on a red carpet. The security was necessary. Shortly after the news broke, a photographer from an LA-based photo agency had scaled the fence into her back garden and waited for Meghan by her car, hoping to get a picture before she headed out to run errands. Meghan was terried and called the police. aposThis is how itaposs always going to be, isnapost it apos, she said to a friend.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Lalia, a mixed-breed dog, has been living on the streets of Cario unable to use her back legs. One of her legs was so badly damaged that it had to be amputated, while the other still hangs lelessly on her body. It is unknown how long Lalia has been living like this - but Miracleaposs Mission has stepped up to transform her le. The animal welfare organisation, who work with sick, injured and disabled animals worldwide, wants to rehome Lalia in the UK - and already have a flight booked for her. However, as she has received no online interest from any potential owners, her spot on the plane might remain empty at take off.A statement on Twitter reads: “Laila will miss her flightwe donapost find a suitable foster this week.“She cannot thrive in a shelter environment - she really needs a home.” Lalia is currently being fostered in Egypt - but is ready to travel as soon as a new owner comes forward. A statement reads: “Laila is a sweet girl who gets around and will likely benefit from a set of wheels to aid her mobility on walks. “Laila is good with other dogs. She would rather not live with children or cats. “Shelter le is particularly dficult for dogs like Laila with disabilities, so we really would like for her to travel as soon as possible.  “She is incontinent and will require bladder expression three or four times a day. This is easy to do and we offer full training in this to all prospective foster and forever families.” Miracle’s Mission is a UK registered animal welfare charity who work predominantly in the UK, Borneo and Egypt. Founded by Victoria Bryceson in , they aim to provide safety and support to animals in need worldwide. A statement reads: “Our mission is to provide a place of safety for animals in danger, to educate on the needs of neutering both pets and strays and to neuter stray dogs and cats to prevent the birth of more animals onto the streets. We also rehabilitate and rehome dogs in need, often with disabilities, from our UK rescue base.”If you’re interested in rehoming Lalia, for either foster or adoption, please contact Miracle’s Mission viainfo@miraclesmission.org .

The cold weather s on Friday with some snow which will get a lot heavier by Sunday. Ms Nasir continued: “The air remains mild through Thursday evening and thenyou are waking up in the South East on Friday morning some heavy rain before it turns clearer and colder from the north. Wintry showers to follow in the more northern and western areas. The snow is expected for higher ground on Friday in most parts of the country.  “Here is that rain and behind that the air is a lot colder so as the rain passes down through Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England, said Ms Nasir. You can see a little bit of snow on its back edge, so cm to cm above m just for a time as it sweeps down towards the South East during the early hours of Friday morning with wintry showers to follow and again the risk of snow about m to m.” People will need to wrap up warm on Friday, especially in the north of the country.  Cold and biting wind towards the north as well as the east, icy conditions here particularly later on as the temperatures tumble and also that mix of showers, again rain, sleet and snow, added Ms Nasir. Maps from WXCharts show temperatures dropping to -C on Friday and several centimetres of snow falling in Scotland and northern England. The snow will continue over the weekend with over cm predicted for Sunday according to the maps. UK forecast for the next  days Today: Cloudy and mild with some patchy rain in the north and west of the UK, but mainly dry with a chance of some brighter spells in the east and south. Heavy rain and gales reaching Scotland and Northern Ireland later. Tonight: Band of heavy rain and gusty winds reaches all but parts of southern England later. Clearer skies with wintry showers and ice risk following, with some snowfall on northern hills. Friday: Feeling markedly colder, with strong winds driving a mix of sunshine and wintry showers.

Cristiano Ronaldo said his -year-old son isn’t allowed a phoneCristiano Ronaldo is refusing to cave in Image: Visionhaus Getty ImagesopinionByEva Simpson:,  Feb |comments I don’t have much in ­common with Cristiano Ronaldo.He’s a multimillionaire ­footballer with luxurious homes across the world and an army of fans and followers on social media. I’m a mum working from a wobbly table in the kitchen. So I was surprised to find out there is one thing we agree on: our attitude towards ­children and gadgets.Earlier this week the Manchester United star revealed his -year-old son Cristiano Jnr – who presumably could have anything money can buy – isn’t allowed a phone, despite constantly pestering him for one.Ronaldo warned of the dangers of being “obsessed” with technology and shared a story that most parents with young children will know only too well – little ones demanding phones. Speaking about tech, Ronaldo said: “Definitely it helps a lot. It helped me and the people here, all the world, and I think we have to take advantage of that but we shouldn’t be obsessed with it.”  He went on: “My oldest child is going to be  years old soon and he asks me every time, ‘Daddy, can I have a phone, can I have a phone, can I have a phone ’ I say to him, ‘Cristiano, you have time.’” I can’t believe he’s been able to hold out for so long. My six-year-old asks, on an almost daily basis,he can have a phone, insisting all his friends have one. The answer is obviously no – he’s far too young and I know most of his friends don’t own one – but nonetheless it is a source of contention. The few times I’ve given him my smartphone to play games or watch a show on, there’s a full-blown meltdown when it comes to getting it back.  When I think about ­children and gadgets, I often recall the words of Steve Jobs, when he was askedhis kids loved one of his greatest inventions: the iPad.He said: “They haven’t used it. We limit the amount of technology our children use at home.” See, even the great Jobs didn’t let his kids loose on gadgets. Technology is important but it’s far better for kids to be creative, make up their own games and, where possible, play outside. That’s what childhood should be about, not being glued to a screen. So now when my son whines, I have the perfect reply. If it’s good enough for Ronaldo’s son not to have a phone, then it’s good enough for you.

She has made a vocation of educating on dementiaWendy Mitchell has early onset dementia Image: Hull News  PictureByEmily RetterSenior Feature Writer:,  Feb |commentsThe ducks know Wendy Mitchell, greeting their old friend in a gentle huddle before she even opens her carrier bag of seed. “Because I come every day they remember me,” she says, beaming at the cacophony of quacking, feeding a couple of the birds from her cupped palm. But while the ducks in the village pond know her, Wendy does not know them at least, she can’t remember them, or doing this.She lives with a combination of Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia, diagnosed in  when she was just .We are at the start of a walk around her village, aptly named Walkington, in East Yorkshire, which she usually repeats two or three times a day. Yet, like the duck feeding, in this moment it is as new for her as it is for me.  These “trundles” give her autonomy, essential to the strict routine she has adopted that helps her continue to live independently . In place of her “memory”, she always slings a camera around her neck, snapping landmarks, birds, animals, treesso when she gets home she can reflect on what she’s done. It sounds like a perpetual Groundhog Day – only for Wendy, it isn’t. Her pedometer has been known to read , steps, but while each might feel familiar, it’s always a first. “Yes, every time, the walk is new,” she nods, brightly. “I don’t remember feeding the ducks yesterday. I know I did, whether it was rainy or sunny I don’t know, orthey came to me straight away like this.  “Once I start up it feels familiar, but every day I’m feeding them for the first time. I never get bored.” When wein an hour, she will admit only knowing she has fed the ducks because her bag is empty. But her fresh eyes, the ability to enjoy things anew, are dementia’s “blessings”, she insists. “I live in the moment. The moment is the only thing we all have for certain. You can learn a lot from people with dementia,” she says.Wendy, , once a super-organised NHS manager with “a photographic memory”, has made a vocation of educating on the disease.Her first book, Somebody I Used to Know, was a bestseller, and her second, What I Wish People Knew About Dementia, written with ghostwriter Anna Wharton, is out now.  As we walkWendy admits she hasn’t always been able to see the positives. Her diagnosis in  was harrowing, and she became depressed. The single mum and her two grown-up daughters knew nothing about dementia. “The process is so negative, it focuses on what you have lost. They say there is nothing you can do and you’re discharged. I was just waiting to die.” Testament to her strength she pulled herself up, mainly for her daughters. Of course she has bad, “foggy” days when she cannot go out, clinging to the sight of her window boxes from bed. This morning wasn’t good. “Every morning I play Scrabble and Solitaire, andI can only make two-letter words, like today, I know it’s a bad morning,” she says.  But so articulate is Wendy, so fiercely independent – she insists her daughters don’t visit every day – it is only the sporadic pauses to find a word that alert me to her dementia. But it affects her in so many ways. Dementia is not just about memory. A surprising fact: she no longer gets hungry or thirsty. She eats and drinks only as a , setting reminders. Her taste has changed too. Her beloved cup of Yorkshire Tea is flavourless to her now. She needs familiarity, so eats the same meal every day for weeks. Currently it’s fish pie.But Wendy struggles to use a kneand fork, and even to see pale food on a white plate.Dementia has played with her eyesight. Anything black, for example, can look like a void.She has hallucinations. “Joyfully” she has seen her late father. And olfactory hallucinations, too. Once a smell of smoke in the house convinced her there was a fire.Her hearing is also affected and loud noises can “physically hurt”.  But as we walk towards the church, she stops when she hears a robin. She can name the birdsong instantly this is an “old memory”. The past is still clear to her, it comes to her in dreams. We pause for  minutes for a picture. Later I remark on how many robin photos she will have. “Have I ” she replies, eagerly. We loop round, today avoiding a field route. Paths she knows will lead back home, in the fields she has become lost. It’s the outline of a row of cottages she clings to, the sound of shrieks in the school playground. Everyone says hello. Wendy replies happily, but explains: “I haven’t a clue who people are.” Worn out, she will need to head home after this to sit in silence, eyes closed. It’s a strange feeling to know she won’t recall me or our walk. “But I will remember the emotion of you,” she assures me. “I will know I met someone with a smiley face.” She now has, she says, only three emotions: happiness, contentment and sadness. She insists she is lucky as others can be left with anger, jealousy. And what about fear  Wendy doesn’t have any of it – “another blessing”, she explains. She once “didn’t like rollercoasters”, but since her dementia, she has been skying. “I’ve now seen an advert for wingwalking,” she adds with a twinkle. She continues: “I can’t say enough how lucky I am. You must never give up on yourself. Don’t underestimate what you can achieve, even at your lowest.” At her front door her sharp eyes spot one final thing. My bag in her porch. It is me that has forgotten it, me who doesn’t have the sharply trained eyes to spot it. Wendy laughs heartily.

Eltiona Skana attacked Emily Jones while she was on her scooter with her dad in Queenaposs Park, Bolton, Greater Manchester, in , when she saw her mother out jogging. The youngster called out to her mum, Sarah Barnes, as she scooted past Skana who was sitting alone at a park bench, armed with a craft kne. Skana, who is originally from Albania and has paranoid schizophrenia, got up and grabbed Emily, cut her throat and then ran off. Today Lady Justice Macur, Mr Justice Sweeney and Mr Justice Morris dismissed an appeal against the sentence by Skana’s barrister Simon Csoka QC. The -year-old admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility and was given a le sentence with a minimum term of ten years and eight months. The minimum term was increased from eight years last year after the sentencing judge, Mr Justice Wall, admitted he had made an error in calculating the term. Lawyers for Skana had appealed against the sentence, arguing the minimum term was too long and that the judge should only have given her a hospital order. She appeared today over video link at the Royal Courts of Justice with her hair pulled back, wearing a grey t-shirt with a star mot and assisted by a translator. Mr Csoka told the court none of the three psychiatrists who gave evidence at the trial have been told by Skana what she was experiencing during the psychotic episode or why she chose to attack Emily.  He said: “To carry out the act in a busy park on a Sunday is, in itself, evidence of some deluded reality that is playing out entirely in Ms Skana’s mind and then tragically playing out in the real world.” Lady Macur admitted the sentencing judge had a “dficult exercise” but the court accepted his original decisions. She said the judge had “sufficient evidence” to find Skana “knew that what she did was wrong and attempted to escape detection and escape the scene”. She said: “Not only must the judge bear in mind the most chilling aspects and most tragic outcome of the circumstances of the nd March  - but also the dficulties presented by the ability of the defendant suffering from such a mental illness. “We consider that the judge bore in mind all responsibilities to the sentencing exercise that he must conduct and did so in a fashion that is to be commended.  “We accept the sentence was severe but we regard it to be in line with the circumstances of the case as a whole.” She added that the family have faced “trauma and tragedy” following Emily’s death. She said: “We express deepest sympathies for Emily’s loss. Words cannot adequately encompass the grief that her family and friends have been subject to.” Speaking during Skana’s sentencing, Emily’s parents said: Emily was the beat in our hearts, the spring in our step and the reason we got up every morning.  “Emily was our beautul, spirited little girl, a bundle of energy with an infectious personality. “Our future has also been taken away, how can you enjoy le when the biggest part of it isnapost there any more  “We cannot move on, because at this time, we cannot see a future.

Elmer was hatched at the zoo in , and Lima in . They are the zooaposs first same-sex foster couple and are part of a colony of  penguins. The zoo has relied on foster penguin parents to incubate eggs in the past and there have been previous tragedies of breeding pairs of penguins unintentionally breaking their fertilized eggs.  Zookeepers have resorted to swapping the real egg for a dummy and giving it to another pair to incubate. Last year, Opal was hatched when first-time foster parents Luis and Calypso incubated her egg and cared for her after her biological parents Juan and Rosalita broke an egg. Elmer and Lima paired up last fall, built a nest and defended their territories.  The team that cares for the penguins decided to test their fostering abilities. Zoo Director Ted Fox said: Some pairs, when given a dummy egg, will sit on the nest but leave the egg to the side and not incubate it correctly, or they’ll fight for who is going to sit on it when. “That’s how we evaluate who will be good foster parents, and Elmer and Lima were exemplary in every aspect of egg care.”  On December , Poquita laid an egg with her mate Venta, and the team swapped it for a dummy. The egg was given to Emler and Lima. The pair took turns incubating the egg until it hatched and have been keeping it warm and feeding it ever since. Mr Fox said: At our first health check when the chick was five days old, it weighed  grams .  “It continues to be brooded and cared for by both Elmer and Lima, who are doing a great job. And once they have experience doing this and continue to do it well, they will be considered to foster future eggs.” Fox added: Elmer and Lima’s success at fostering is one more story that our zoo can share to help people of all ages and backgrounds relate to animals. Humboldt penguins are native to the Humboldt current off the coast of Chile and Peru in South America. They are considered vulnerable as the wild population is declining due to habitat loss and climate change.

People working as cashiers in supermarkets and discount shops are often faced with disgruntled customers, and anyone who has worked a retail job knows exactly how tough it is.But thanks to one woman on TikTok, those of us who donapost work in these positions can now see what itaposs like firsthand, as former Wilko employee Holly Laing has dedicated her account to sharing the funniest and most irritating customer interactions sheaposs had while on the clock. Posting on her account @holly_laing, the experienced shop-floor worker revealed her biggest pet peeve when it comes to customers is the number of mistakes they make while paying - and one particular incident saw her running after someone who had walked out before their payment was processed.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Holly revealed the introduction of contactless payments has become a nightmare for cashiers, as people will tap their card and begin walking away before the till has accepted their payment - which can lead to complicated matterstheir card is declined. Acting out the experience in one video, Holly told the fictional customer that their shopping came to £, and the shopper - who was also played by Holly in the sketch - said: Right cheers. Contactless  Thanks. After tapping their card, the customer walked out of the store, leaving Holly to chase after them to get them to come back and try to pay again. She said: Hey sir  Excuse me, sir ! You didnapost pay properly, it didnapost go through. Do you want to just put your card in the machine this time  Hollyaposs videos have also touched on how annoying it is when customers attempt to hand cashiers their card to pay instead of just using the pin-pad themselves, as well as a more recent pet peeve that has arisen since the Covid- pandemic, with people being warier than ever about using cash.The woman explained in another clip that when customers do decide to use cash, they sometimes ask the cashier to put the change directly into their wallet because they donapost want to touch it. Impersonating the customer, Holly said in her video: Oh ... would you mind just putting it back in [my wallet]  I just donapost want to touch it. To which Holly then fumed: Donapost pay with cashyou don’t wanna touch it! Hollyaposs videos have been resonating with her , followers, and many commenters who also work in the service industry shared their own irritating interactions with customers. One person said: The worst thing is when you ask them to insert their card the second time but they tap anyway andit doesn’t work. While another added: Someone sneezed in their hand then used that same hand to give me the money... And someone  posted: I once had to chase after a customer and he went into another shop.What do you think  Let us know in the comments below.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TikTokViralFunny ha ha viralWilko\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Tanisha Clay @tanishaclayyhas spoken on TikTok about having always wanted children, and how one day she decided to allow herself the pleasure of looking at baby clothes before starting her own baby closet - now sheaposs expecting her own little one. The TikToker is encouraging other women who want children one day to do the same, promising nothing will go to waste as any unused items will always get passed onto friends and other expecting mums.  Okay hear me out. If youaposre a girl who wants a baby one day, maybe not today, just one day, just hear me out, because I have a tip that is going to bring you joy and a lot less of a headache later, she told her followers. If you’re the kind of girl whose eyes light up when you walk past the baby section, let me just tell you why you should stop walking and go in. Tanisha asked her followers whether theyaposd ever been to a baby shower and seen the mum-to-be opening present after present of newborn baby clothes, but what happens when the baby is too big to fit in the newborn clothing, she asked. Instead, the mum-to-be came up with her own plan, which she started long before she fell pregnant herself, called the baby closet. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Rule number one is that the item needs to be gender neutral, she explained. Rule number two is thatit’s for a boy I need to be able to pair it with a bow to make it fit a girl. Tanisha went on to say rule number three is that anything she canapost use when she has her own child should be passed on to someone  at a baby shower. There’s actually a fourth rule in that it has to be sized three to  months. No newborn, she added. Tanisha said she always shops baby clothes when theyaposre in the sale, making the exception when she finds something thataposs just too cute to pass up. I do not purposely go looking for baby clothes, I let the baby clothes find me and it has brought me so much joy and anticipation while me and my husband are waiting for the right time to have a baby, she added. The TikToker told her followers about the baby closet back in August last year, however she has since revealed that after a long time trying, she and her husband are now expecting their first baby. Huge congratulations Tanisha, and what a well dressed baby you will have.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

According to this mum, the party is due to take place this coming Sunday at an activity centre with a climbing wall, with the kids heading for some food afterwards.Taking to Mumsnet, the surprised mother explained that they accepted the invitation some weeks back, and have already bought a present and card.However, she was left a little taken aback after being sent an unexpected message from the birthday childaposs parent less than one week before the big day.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Calling upon her fellow mums for advice, she said: Weaposve been sent a message yesterday from birthday childaposs parent last night which says that all children under eight must be supervised by an adult each, which is ok with me I donapost mind stayingbut that in order to stay and supervise we have to buy a full-price adults ticket, which costs £! Wondering whether this was a usual request - especially when made so close to the big day - the slightly peeved parent admitted that it seems a bit of a cheek to me! In the comments, she went on to explain that it is only a small party of maybe eight or so children. All of the kids are under the age of eight, except for the birthday child, meaning all parents will have to stay and pay.She added: I suspect most parents were planning on staying regardless as theyaposre quite young but I donapost think anyone would have expected to fork out £ for the privilege! Many commenters completely understood her reservations, with one user even advising that she would call the place myself and check, addingtrue I would withdraw and do something  instead. Another confessed theyaposd be pretty shocked by that! wondering whether the parent has only just realised the cost oritaposs a case of poor communication from the venue. They added: Whenever weaposve been to birthday parties at soft play leisure centres activities etc., the cost of supervising and running the activity is covered by the parents, itaposs part of the party cost in my opinion.

Soon-to-be mum-of-two Ashlee recently celebrated her gender reveal, where family and friends gathered to see her pop a balloon to reveal whether her unborn baby would be a girl or a boy. Ashlee @dinkymisspretty , from the United States, already has a son, so was absolutely overjoyed and overcome with emotion when she popped the balloon and saw pink confetti flying in front of her face, signalling sheaposs having a baby girl - or so she first thought. Posting a clip to her TikTok, Ashlee showed the moment she burst the balloon at her gender reveal, andyou look closely you can see the confetti coming out of the balloon is actually blue, but at that exact moment, her mum decided to shoot a cannon of pink confetti right in her face.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Itaposs hard to understand why any mum would want to play with her own daughteraposs emotions like that, especially when theyaposre pregnant. Ashlee can be seen jumping up and down with joy at seeing the pink confetti, only for her face to turn to thunder when her little boy came over to tell her what her mum had done. Clearly you can see I wanted a girl so bad and in that moment I felt like I hit the lottery, the mum says in the clip, adding: Then here comes my son making me realise its really another boy. I was p***ed. This is the only one I can actually be okay with the parent being mad. Cause why play like that, one follower commented, to which Ashlee responded: Right, I wasnapost mad it was a boy I was mad they had me think it was a girl. Another added: Now see this reaction is valid because you can’t play with a pregnant woman’s emotions like that. I’m sure you’ll have a beautul baby boy though.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Lots of locksmiths told her that they would not mess with a floor safe. More than six million people have since watched the video and are desperate to know whataposs inside the safe. After speaking to numerous people, the TikToker was put in touch with a man named Jim, who is known for being able to crack dficult safe combinations. Liz made an appointment for Jim to come out and take a look at the safe, meanwhile social media users couldnapost help but speculate about what was inside.

From furniture, pots and pans in the kitchen, bed and cushion covers, vases and cupboards, to her scooter and helmet, and even her mobile phone, Fitri Rahmawati has everything in yellow. The -year-old teacher and mum-of-two young boys from West Java in Indonesia, has spent years building herself a aposyellow le.apos Her personal items such as pouches, bags, drinking bottles, hand sanitiser, tote bags, calendars, cell phone cases, stationery, are all yellow. She said: “I really like yellow, every time I see something in yellow, Iaposm definitely interested and want to have it.  Fitri’s fixation with the colour yellow began as a child when she was fascinated by the bright cheerful colour that was also a symbol of a political party. By the time she grew up and moved to a university, she had amassed all her stuff in yellow. She said: “I started liking yellow colour when I was in elementary school. “In high school, I didnapost have many collections because I couldnapost afford to buy them myself, but my closest friends knew enough that I liked yellow and always gave me yellow items as birthday gts.  “When I had my own income, I started buying more yellow things and my love has continued to grow. Fitri’s unique obsession further grew when she got married and moved in with her husband. She gradually started collecting yellow items for her dream house. She said: “When I was married, I started buying yellow equipment. Starting from the wallpaper, sheets, carpets, curtains, and custom-made sofas. “Then I bought stickers for the fridge, stove, dispenser so they all turn yellow. Decorative shelves, umbrella holders, umbrellas, scales, flower pots. All yellow.  “I am very happy that Apple released yellow iPhone products on the XR and iPhone  types. Now I use the yellow iPhone . Despite her massive collection at home, Fitri’s obsession for yellow has not ended. She added: “I buy a lot of my collection online, as not many shops stock yellow goods. Although her whole le is painted with the bright colour, Fitri doesn’t wear many yellow clothes. Fitri says she has become a popular name among her social circle for her fixation with yellow. She added: “People around me such as friends, students, family and even acquaintances often say that when they see the yellow item, it immediately reminds them of me. They even send me pictures of cute yellow stuff. “When people visit our house, they are quite surprised and will always compliment for my persistence in making my house yellow. Iaposm quite happy with their reactions.

I had actually played with Scotty when he was on loan at Brechin City from Dunfermline, so I knew what he was capable of.

And it gives us the opportunity to let him see what we are about and come the end of the season we will probably assess that again.“Everyone knows Gala is a great club. I think that little bit of professionalism and trying to do things in the right manner will help bring him on. He came down and trained with us and as soon as he met the chairman and the boys make everyone feel welcome when they come to the club .“There is a real togetherness there so I think it will suit Scotty going forward so it’s up to him what he does from here until the end of the season. I told him that he will get an opportunity to play but he needs to show me that he’s here to contribute.“He has a good pedigree at Dunfermline and Celtic as a kid and he’s got a good attitude but has just lost his way a bit in terms of going on loan to Brechin City when they were in League Two. It was a tough ask to come in and play men’s football when they were just desperate for results. So it probably wasn’t the ideal fit for him. Going forward, coming to us will suit him as he has an eye for a pass and an eye for a goal and is comfortable on both feet. He can go outside or inside and has a bit of pace.

knowledgeNew Highway Code rules – what you need to knowHere’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder..removeThis technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip

and the former toll-house in Belhaven is also still there today.Kirkhill Toll in Dunbar has been demolished, nor is there any longer a toll-house in Broxburn.There have been ergent opinions whether there was also a turnpike toll in East Linton, with some suspecting that there had been a mix-up with the undoubted toll-house in West Linton, Borders [still standing and the Olde Toll Tea House today].Both places were referred to just as ‘Linton’ in Victorian times, confounding the postmen and delivery boys for many years until the names were changed.A key source about East Lothian toll-houses and milestones is Forrest’s  map of Haddingtonshire.This map clearly shows a ‘Toll Barr’ just to the south-east of the village of Linton, situated at a crossroads to be able to charge toll in both directions.A toll in the vicinity of Linton is referred to already in Taylor  Skinner’s  Survey of the Roads.The next source is the  Itinerary of Scotland, which mentions Linton Toll-bar, just at the east of the village.Importantly, the name-book of the - Ordnance Survey [OS    ] lists the house as “A toll gate at which road dues are collected between Linton and Dunbar.“It is the property of the County road trustees, and is at present occupied by Gilbert Miller.”Thus it can be concluded that East Linton did, indeed, have a turnpike toll-house, probably dating back at least to the mid-th century when the tollbars were set up and the houses constructed along the main turnpike road.Like the other tolls mentioned here, it was a casualty to the railways being constructed, reducing road traffic very considerably and starving the toll-keepers out of existence in late Victorian times.But where is the old toll-house today There is no building on the main road past East Linton in any way resembling a toll-house, and the crossroads where it once stood has long since disappeared after a scheme to construct a bypass outside the village.Computerised super-imposition of a present-day map of East Linton onto Forrest’s  map indicates that the toll-house would be situated close to what is today Lauder Place.And, indeed, a stroll through those parts reveals the existence of the ‘Old Toll House’, accessed through a driveway from Lauder Place.A humble, single-story building just like the other East Lothian toll-houses, it has been signicantly extended at the back.By the present owner, it was identied as the former toll-house by the original deeds, which have since been mislaid.It would today have had a most tranquil situation, far from any of the major roads, had not the mainline railway been just a few feet away, with the trains roaring by with a deafening noise.When its present owner bought the old toll-house  years ago, it was in decent repair, albeit very small and cramped.Curiously, there was then a three foot square stone built room with a small window with iron bars, a prison cell perhaps, intended for people who refused to pay the toll But since the toll-keepers had no powers to imprison people, perhaps it was rather a whisky store, since the toll-keepers often doubled as low-level publicans It is also possible that the magistrates required a convenient holding-cell for local offenders before taking them to a burgh tolbooth.Since the ‘cell’ has long since been removed and the toll-house extensively renovated, with no original features remaining, we will never know.The East Lothian authorities built their toll-houses sturdy and strong, and the Old Toll House in East Linton is likely to stand for centuries to come.Jan

responsibility to look out for cyclists and pedestrians risk failing to boost safety due to not being widely promoted, campaigners have warned.Charity Cycling UK said that a “long-term and well-funded communications campaign” is needed to make people aware of the update.The Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, is being amended this weekend to introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.Here’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip hazard from trailing cables."},{"url":null,"title":"pmqs-today-watch-live-stream-following-sue-gray-report","story":"Sue Gray found that “at least some of the gatherings” she investigated represent “a serious failure to observe not just the high standards expected of those working at the heart of Government but also of the standards expected of the entire British population at the time.The final line of the report reads: “There is signicant learning to be drawn from these events which must be addressed immediately across Government. This does not need to wait for the police investigations to be concluded.”Johnson addressed the Commons on Monday where he faced further calls to resign.He told the Commons: “Firstly, I want to say sorry – and I’m sorry for the things we simply didn’t get right and also sorry for the way this matter has been handled.“It’s no use saying this or that was within the rules and it’s no use saying people were working hard. This pandemic was hard for everyone.”He faced shouts of “resign” from Opposition MPs as he told the Commons: “We asked people across this country to make the most extraordinary sacrices – not to meet loved ones, not to visit relatives before they died, and I understand the anger that people feel.“But it isn’t enough to say sorry. This is a moment when we must look at ourselves in the mirror and we must learn.“While the politan Police must yet complete their investigation, and that means there are no details of specic events in Sue Gray’s report, I of course accept Sue Gray’s general findings in full, and above all her recommendation that we must learn from these events and act now.”Addressing parliament on Tuesday, Sturgeon asserted her belief that Johnson has misled parliament.She said: “I think there is very little public trust remaining in the integrity and the decision making of the Prime Minister and his government in these matters.”📣 @NicolaSturgeon: \"It is now impossible to reach any conclusion other than the Prime Minister has seriously and serially misled the House of Commons.\"👉🏼 Boris Johnson has broken the rules and lied about it - andTories allow him to continue as PM, theyll all be complicit. pic VyjeYay“I think it is now also impossible to reach any other conclusion than the Prime Minister has seriously and serially misled the House of Commons,” she continued.You can live stream the questions faced by the Prime Minister on several channels.PMQs will begin at the normal time of pm.BBC Parliament will be streaming PMQs via BBC iPlayer while Sky News will also be providing live coverage on Youtube.You will also be able to watch along at Parliament Live TV which you can access here."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/12800707.jpg?type=article-full","title":"runs-scotland-investigation-scotlands-corridors-power-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access to the people and organisations with signicant influence over so many aspects of our lives. From the hundreds of secret lobbying meetings to who really runs Scotlands wind farms, whisky and media - the investigation will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.Hundreds of meetings between Scottish ministers and multinationals, wealthy iniduals and other influential organisations were left off the lobbying register in  due to loopholes in legislation, The Ferret can reveal. Analysis of Scottish Government ministers’ engagements in  shows that meetings, potentially of key public interest, were not in the register, including those between ministers and companies awarded multi-million pound UK and Scottish contracts to supply the NHS in the run-up to Covid-.  Read the full scale of unrecorded discussions here.Professional lobbyists, including former politicians, advisors and a former minister have met with Scottish Government representatives on behalf of clients  times since March , The Ferret can reveal. Scotland is home to dozens of public relations, think-tanks and consultancy firms, including several formed by or employing people who served in the upper echelons of government. Find out the whos who of professional lobbyists here.Questions have been raised over the power and influence of energy companies following analysis by The Ferret revealing how key sectors dominate Scottish lobbying. The Ferret categorised  organisations that lobbied Scottish Government ministers since the register was introduced in  to increase transparency. Read the full exclusive analysis here.Big business including oil and renewable energy, farming, fishing, finance and whisky dominated Scotland Office ministers’ meetings last year, analysis by The Ferret has found.   We looked at all external meetings logged in  by Alister Jack, Secretary of State for Scotland, UK Government ministers for Scotland David Duguid and Iain Stewart, as well as Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross, who was deputy Secretary of State until he resigned in May that year.   Read the full report exclusively here.The number of companies registered in tax havens investing in Scotland over the last decade has increased by nearly  per cent. Analysis of Scottish Government data by The Ferret found that in  there were  firms registered in the Cayman Islands, Bermuda and British Virgin Islands operating, compared to  in .

Sam, , trained in Silversmithing and Metalwork at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts in London but grew up on the Isle of Lewis and lived on Orkney for  years. “I started fishing again when I moved up to Orkney,” he explains. “I made a fish sculpture for the house and friends saw and liked it and wanted it for themselves, and everything grew from there.”Sam now lives in East Lothian, and says that the sea has always been a major feature in his le. He is an keen fisherman, er, swimmer and retains a deep fascination with the ocean and all its creatures.He notes: “My choice of subject, the fish, suits very much the material I work with. The metals seem to suit the hard, shininess of the fish. People like the aesthetic appeal of the fish, and I think it’s the same sort of fascination people have for the sea. I sell to fishermen and ious people the majority of whom are connected to the sea or rivers in some way.”From his studio Sam creates impressions of fish using the tactile effects that metal , its processes and techniques have to offer.“Because all the scales are hand done and beaten, you can go a wee bit mad,” he laughs. “I did once count how many hammer blows were in one of the herring that I do and there was .”Sam’s work has been featured on TV and he has also shown at group exhibitions in galleries including the House of Bruar, the Royal Scottish Academy, The Wykeham Gallery and Visions West Gallery, Montana.www.sam-macdonald ROIS SCOTTISH SEA GLASSFor Rois Clark, one person’s trash truly is another person’s treasure. Since , Rois, , has been creating unique pieces of jewellery from the sea glass she finds on Scotland’s coasts.“I’d noticed someone making shell and sea glass jewellery in Hawaii years ago, and I’d never seen it used that way before,” she says.“I started to look around beaches in Scotland and found we had our own sea glass. Then I noticed how dferent shores have produce dferent types of sea glass – the colours, types of bottles and textures were unique to the conditions of the that particular coastline.”Rois Clark Rois, who is based in Glasgow, admits the main source of satisfaction from her work derives from creating meaningful jewellery from broken pieces of old discarded glass.“My background is in Student Ministry,” she comments, “mostly working with younger vulnerable women.“I find it quite a prayerful practice making treasure out of the broken pieces – the action for me is a symbol of hope. We’ve all had our own tumultuous journey, and many vulnerable people can feel a little broken themselves, but when handled with care and attention things can change.”Rois collects her sea glass from over  beaches all over Scotland, gathering samples of ying shapes, colours, and textures. Each piece of jewellery is handpicked, handmade and comes with a map stating where it was found.She says: “I’d say  per cent of people who select my products choose it for the location aspect. A lot of the time people share a story about why that location means so much to them.”www.roisseaglass IONA TURNER ARTISTSince graduating from Glasgow School of Art last June, artist Iona Turner has impressed many with her original jewellery made from seaweed foraged from Scotland’s beaches.Growing up in Edinburgh, Iona chose  to spend a lot of her time by the sea and since the age of  she has been a seasonal surf instructor in East Lothian.Iona Turner “I began working with the materials that I was foraging there after developing a desire to make something using the natural surroundings,” she says.“I came to seaweed through foraging it for food, that’s how I got a bit more familiar with its materiality.“The process I have is low-impact and a sensitive approach to the seaweed – I don’t meddle too much with it before making my pieces.”Iona forages for seaweed that’s been ripped up by natural processes, such as after a storm or a big swell. The storm-cast knotted-wrack seaweed is used to make her bold statement pieces of jewellery.She says: “I really like that I get to collect the material myself and source it from places that I love. I also love working with a material where there is no waste from it – any discards are made into compost. And what I really enjoy most about the seaweed is that I get to be the supply chain.“I think my buyers are drawn to my pieces because of the sense of the closeness to nature and the fact that they are buying something that doesn’t have the same consumer guilt that other products can have. Just having that connection to a coastal place is also a big draw.”www.instagram iona.maker"},{"url":null,"title":"ali-price-insists-finn-russell-not-maverick-lifts-lid-scotland-team-mate","story":"However, the player who almost certainly knows and understands the Scottish stand-off best believes that this categorisation doesn’t give adequate credit to Russell’s vision and rugby intelligence. Ali Price and Russell were team-mates at Glasgow Warriors for five seasons at the start of their professional careers, they have played half-back together for Scotland  times, and both toured South Africa with the Lions last summer when they featured in the final Test. They shared a flat in Glasgow before Russell’s move to Racing  in the summer of  and remain close. “I wouldn’t say he’s a maverick – I would say he reads the game dferently to pretty much any other  in the world,” said Price earlier this week, as he looked ahead to Scotland kicking off their  Six Nations campaign with an eagerly anticipated Calcutta Cup clash against England on Saturday. Price and Russell will almost certainly be named as Nos  and  in Gregor Townsend’s team when it is announced at lunchtime today. “The space he sees and the skillset he has that enables him to pull off certain moves – the chips, the long balls, the passes – makes him unique,” Price continued.  “It’s just him. He’s a world-class . For me, my job is to try and help facilitate that as much as I can.  “He’s always looking for space. We’ve got a good relationship where we know what each other is thinking most of the time, which obviously helps.” When Price first broke into the Scotland team back in , there was concern in some quarters that he was too much of a free-spirit to play alongside Russell – but the -year-old has matured into an important leader of the side. That earned him his call-up to last summer’s Lions tour, and he believes the trip took his game to the next level.  Now he is determined to use his Lions experience to help Scotland make the leap from plucky underdogs capable of one-off victories against the top teams into genuine contenders for the Six Nations title. “You can pick up on things here and there, maybe little comments that players from other nations may have made while we were in South Africa about how they approach certain aspects of a game,” he explained. “That could be quite valuable – but that works both ways in terms of the opposition maybe knowing what some of us Scottish players could be thinking at certain moments.” The key to success in the Six Nations is no secret: it is a sprint rather than a marathon, so it is essential to start fast and then accelerate. With that in mind, Price believes Scotland can learn from last year’s campaign when they finished fourth in the table despite famous wins in London and Paris. “We had that great win at Twickenham, which was the first in  odd years, and we were in a great position the following week against Wales in terms of score-line, but they got it by a point come the end,” he said. “Ireland, again, was a three-point game. So, its just about putting it all together now. “Getting victories on the board in week one and week two puts you in a good position on the table, so thats what we will be trying to do,” he continued. “Thats what were doing in training now fine tuning and getting ourselves right for the first game because you cant look past the first game, its massive.  “If you get four or five wins then youre knocking at the door on that last weekend to see where you finish up. Hopefully  we can put it all together by drawing on the experiences from last year and the year before, then we should be in a good place come the last weekend.  “From an inidual and team point of view, having the confidence and the belief that we can beat these teams comes from the fact that we have beaten these teams. “The belief is certainly there thatwe can go out and implement how we want to play and our game-plan then we have the players, the ability and the skill level to come away with victories. “I dont know whether its arrogance, but its definitely a belief, a confidence. “Theres depth in every position now, which maybe has been lacking at times in the past, so there are no excuses because weve got it all there, weve got the training facilities, weve got everything in place for us to perform.  “Theres a lot of guys in good form who are looking to go out there and enjoy it and hopefully get off to the best start possible.” "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I continue to speak with the Leader of Orkney Islands Council, to explore all the ways we can help fund these exciting projects.”Reacting after the exchange, Mr Carmichael said:“After years of success putting the Northern Isles on the map for green energy innovation, it could be easy to forget that the success of EMEC did not come out of nowhere.

Children from P , P  and P  are instead accessing learning from home. Three classes — P, P  and P — and the nursery remain open.On Monday evening, Orkney Islands Council shared hopes to reopen the school fully on Wednesday, with further updates to be confirmed today, Tuesday.Head teacher Islean Gibson has been meeting with representatives from the education service and public health on a daily basis and this will continue as required.She has also been communicating directly with families on the ever-evolving situation and is heartened by the support shown.“We are confident that the home learning on offer to our three classes is working well for families at this time,# Miss Gibson said.#Part of our meeting involved planning for the rest of this week, and I will be writing out to everyone as soon as is possible tomorrow to let parents know what we hope we can provide across the remainder of this week.“It has been an exceptionally tough day for staff and a tricky balance in terms of in class teaching and making sure we have learning going home, so I thank all from the bottom of my heart for the understanding as we all try to get to grips with our new normal for today and tomorrow. To say the team at Dounby have rallied is nowhere near thanks enough.”OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, added: “The school is experiencing a high number of teaching and support staff absences due to sickness which includes COVID, and this is now coupled with an increasing number of pupils being off across some of the classes too.“Whilst there are  reported COVID-positive LFD and PCR cases within the staff and pupils at the school, it is the combination of all the sickness absences that has led to this decision. We are looking to all measures to try and ensure the school can operate in full from Wednesday, and this will be communicated tomorrow.“Please be assured that we are doing everything we possibly can to get back to normal as soon as possible. I want to also commend the Head Teacher and her team for stepping up in these dficult circumstances.”Despite a relaxation of restrictions nationwide, it remains vital for everyone to continue carrying out lateral flow tests and to report the result, whether positive, negative or void here: https:www.nhsinform.scot # coronavirus-covid-#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is arguably one of the most important vessels in our maritime history.”His announcement came after a -year investigation of a number of th century ships in a two-square mile area off the US coast.The famous ship lay just  metres off the coast of Rhode Island, where it was “buried in nearly  years’ worth of sediment and silt”,  metres below the surface.However, an hour after Mr Sumption’s announcement, the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Projectstepped in, labelling the announcement “premature” and a “breach of contract”.The executive director of RIMAP Dr Kathy Abbass fired back at the Australians’ claim, adding that RIMAP was the lead organisation for the study.In a statement provided toAustralia, she said: “There are many unanswered questions that could overturn such an identication .“RIMAP recognises the connection between Australian citizens of British descent and the Endeavour, but RIMAP’s conclusions will be driven by proper scientic process and not Australian emotions or politics.”In a statement on the ANMM website, Mr Sumption announced: “It is with great pride that after a -year program of archival and archaeological fieldwork that, based on a preponderance of evidence approach, I have concluded that an archaeological site known as RI , located in Newport Harbor, Rhode Island, USA, comprises the shipwreck of HM Bark Endeavour”.Since , maritime archaeologists had been investigating several th century ships in the underwater site.The findings, which are the joint work of the ANMM, the RIMAP and the Silentworld Foundation, will now be published and peer-reviewed by archaeologists from around the globe.“But for now, there’s a lot confidence that Endeavour has finally been found,” Mr Sumption said.The Endeavour was deliberately sunk in  in Newport Harbour by British forces around seven years after its key role in Cook’s first voyage to the Pacic.After chartering the oceans which were largely unknown to Europeans at the time, including the New Zealand coast and the east coast of Australia – where it narrowly avoided shipwreck on the Great Barrier Reef – the Endeavour was largely forgotten.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

These investments in clean energy will help grow the green economy and reduce Northern Ireland’s dependence on imported fossil fuels.”The Academy will be driven by a public-private partnership that includes Northern Regional College, Belfast politan College, Queen’s University Belfast, Ulster University and the University of Birmingham.A consortium of key industry players also involved includes Wrightbus, Energia, Translink, Firmus, and EP UK Investments.Speaking at the launch, Mayor of Mid and East Antrim Councillor William McCaughey said: “The announcement of this revolutionary Hydrogen Training Academy is welcome and timely, particularly as we heighten our focus on creating and sustaining long term economic recovery and growth in the aftermath of a global pandemic.“Mid and East Antrim is uniquely placed in Northern Ireland in terms of the key strengths and assets we boast in energy and cleantech that align with the ambition of net zero carbon targets. The Academy will support the development of the Ballymena area as a ‘hydrogen hub’ and continue to build upon our Borough’s reputation as a centre of excellence and the main focal point of the emerging Northern Ireland wide hydrogen economy.“I commend Council’s Elected Members and officers who, in collaboration with our public and private sector partners, have invested a huge amount of time and effort in bringing the project to this stage. I very much look forward to seeing the Academy grow and to witnessing the longer-term economic impact it will undoubtedly have in the coming years.“Today’s announcement along with future plans for investment in the iC Innovation and Cleantech Centre at St. Patrick’s Barracks and the recent announcement of pound million joint funding with QUB under the Northern Ireland Executive’s City and Growth Deals Complementary Fund for a Ballymena Integrated Green Hydrogen Hub further supports and cements our ambition.”Ian Luney, Commercial Director at EP UK Investments, said: “EPUKI is delighted to support Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, alongside other partners across the public and private sectors, in the development of the Hydrogen Training Academy in Ballymena. As the owners of Kilroot and Ballylumford Power Stations, we recognise the value of supporting innovation and training, particularly in emerging cleantech industries such as the hydrogen sector.“The production and use of hydrogen is part of our long-term vision for the Kilroot Energy Park. Upskilling existing and new employees through the academy will be crucial in enabling Northern Ireland to benefit from opportunities in a thriving hydrogen economy over the coming years and EPUKI look forward to contributing to that.”The launch of the Academy comes as Mid and East Antrim Borough Council welcomes the arrival of a new state-of-the-art training pod for the first cohort of trainees to use.Based at Silverwood Business Park, the H Gas Safe Lab is the first of two facilities for the Ballymena area and is targeted at the NI Gas Safe Register plumbing and heating industry to provide a competence testing space for work with commercial level equipment.The state-of-the-art facility is the first mixed-gas hydrogen-testing lab in the UK for Gas Safe engineers, with multiple systems to help reduce carbon footprints in houses and offices.Northern Regional College will house the second training facility focusing on the production of hydrogen through specialist training equipment. This facility will provide a technology familiarisation teaching space for all levels in the basics of green hydrogen.Graham Whitehurst MBE, Chair of Mid and East Antrim’s Manufacturing Task Force, explained how the Hydrogen Training Academy will play a “critical role” in training and upskilling existing employees as well as new trainees to a recognised professional competence standard required for the hydrogen sector.“Through the Hydrogen Training Academy and a range of other initiatives, led by our Manufacturing Task Force, Mid and East Antrim is cementing its position as a hub for SME innovation and commercialisation activity and a springboard for the future of the cleantech growth sector and industry.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4419803.jpg--.jpg?1643793308000\n","title":"new moderator was brought up in ballymena","story":" A minister who grew up in Ballymena from infancy is to be the next Moderator of the Presbyterian Church. Rev John Kirkpatrick will be known as the Moderator-Designate until the Church’s General Assembly in June, when he will formally succeed the current Moderator, Right Reverend Dr David Bruce. A son and grandson ‘of the Manse’ – he was one of four nominees that the all-Ireland denomination had to choose from this year, which traditionally elects its Moderator-Designate on the first Tuesday in February.Alongside Mr Kirkpatrick, this year’s nominees were Rev Dr Colin McClure, minister of First Larne Presbyterian Church, Rev Dr Trevor McCormick, minister of Frist Kilrea and Boveedy Presbyterian Churches and Rev Alastair McNeely, minister of Richhill Presbyterian Church. Each received the following votes: middot Rev John Kirkpatrick  votes: The Presbyteries of Ballymena, North Belfast, South Belfast, East Belfast, Dromore, Dublin  Munster, Iveagh, Omagh, Templepatrick and Tyronemiddot Rev Dr Colin McClure  vote: The Presbytery of Carrickfergusmiddot Rev Dr Trevor McCormick  votes: The Presbyteries of Coleraine  Limavady, Newry, and Routemiddot Rev Alastair McNeely  votes: The Presbyteries of Ards, Armagh, Derry  Donegal, Down, Monaghan.Having received the most votes from the Church’s  presbyteries, Mr Kirkpatrick will be the denomination’s th Moderator since  and its first from Portrush Presbyterian Church.Speaking about his election, the -year-old North Coast minister said, “I am genuinely surprised by what has happened, but very excited at the prospect of the story God is going to write from June and the months that follow. As I continue to serve the Lord Jesus in this new role, I am looking forward to coming alongside our churches at this critical time, encouraging them as we move forward from Covid. I also look forward to building good relationships wherever possible, honouring Jesus and representing our Church across the island and further afield.”Born in in Limavady, Mr Kirkpatrick was brought up from the age of three in Ballymena. A third generation Presbyterian minister – his father had been minister of Balteagh Presbyterian, near Limavady, while his grandfather had also served in congregations in Counties Donegal, Tyrone and Antrim.Mr Kirkpatrick has been minister of Portrush Presbyterian for nearly  years, having served in the holiday town since . Prior to that, he spent nearly six years in Garryduff Presbyterian near Ballymoney, his first congregation. He was ordained in  as an assistant minister in Megain Memorial and Mersey Presbyterian Churches in East Belfast. When he became minister in Portrush, he also represented PCI in its partner relationships in Central and Eastern Europe until .Having attended Ballymena County Primary School and Coleraine Academical Institution, he went on to study farm management at Greenmount Agricultural College from -, with an agri career in mind. This led to three years of study at the University of Ulster’s, Coleraine campus, where in  he gained a BSc in Social Science and Environmental Studies. After spending a year working for the Department of Agriculture, in  he attended Belfast Bible College before starting his studies at Union Theological College for the ordained ministry of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the same year.Talking about his faith, Mr Kirkpatrick said, “With a father and a grandfather as Presbyterian ministers, you might say that I am not only ‘a son of the Manse’, but ‘a grandson of the Manse’ as well. While I came to a personal faith in Jesus at the age of nine, there was never an expectation that I would follow in their footsteps. But God, obviously, had other plans and I genuinely give thanks for the near  years I have spent in the ordained ministry.”Today he ministers to a congregation of around  families in and around the seaside town, which grows considerably during the summer months and at Easter. “I would describe myself as a ‘preaching pastor’, as I see the linked importance of preaching and teaching the Bible, coupled with pastoral care being the complimentary need to this.“The issues that we face at Portrush Presbyterian Church, or ‘PPC’, are set against the context of the st century, a secular society, but a hungry society. In my time in PPC we have reflected the wider cultural trends, which I am glad to say have been away from ‘nominalism’ and traditional church attendance, to a more committed church community living in a community where outwardly church is less important, but certainly not without value.“Primarily we love to share the Good News in all ways we can, but we know we must earn trust and respect. In this, we see the location of PPC as critical to a very wide community of visitors and friends, helped by street gospel distributions and other opportunities as cultural moments in the town provide s for evangelism. As Moderator, I want to translate the le and experience of ministry in Portrush, both church and community, to a bigger canvas, but with the same vision and pattern,” he said.Mr Kirkpatrick also explained that building relationships with the community, and serving the community, were both important. “We see our presence as a gospel one, building relationships with all where we can people and organisations are part of this involvement from our local schools, to the PPC’s shop in the town that connects with community in a dferent way and funds ious community projects. We also encourage our members to be active in the community in ious ways through the RNLI and REACH, for example, a community project which took on a greater signicance due to Covid.”With regards to the pandemic, he said that while the lockdown was dficult for so many dferent reasons, it also created an opportunity to try new things. “We did recorded services and streaming services. I did a daily devotional called ‘Side-by-Side’ and a video reading of several appropriate books such as ‘The hiding place’ by Corrie ten Boom, ‘To a dferent drum’ by Pauline Hamilton, and Elizabeth Kuhn’s, ‘Green leaf in drought’ as I wanted to encourage our people in their isolation.”Married to Joan for  years this summer, a palliative care nurse, they have four children and five grandchildren. “Thursday was baking day in our home during the lockdown when Joan baked. The following day I was able to deliver to folk as part of my rounds, giving me a chance to listen to them and pray for them on the doorstep, or in their garden. We’ve made every effort to be in church and have le back when we were given the chance. Thankfully we have a big building, which has meant we could welcome everyone back safely.”Thinking about his forthcoming year in office, Mr Kirkpatrick said, “For everyone, the last two years have seen all aspects of le, and Church le with it, turned upside down and the story still isn’t over yet. As time moves on, I hope and pray that we will be able to process the many painful memories that it has left behind. I appreciate that this will not be an easy, or a straightforward journey for everyone, as our stories are all dferent.“With this in mind, as Moderator, I look forward to visiting congregations, ministers and their families, seeing what they have been through, how they have coped, and ministering into that. Stepping into my predecessor’s shoes after two years will not be easy, and I pay tribute to Dr Bruce as he has led the Church through this time of national and global crisis. Whatever the year may hold, I am thankful to God, that I won’t be undertaking it alone, and certainly not in my own strength, for Jesus will be with me!”When Mr Kirkpatrick is not in the pulpit, or visiting members of his congregation, he says that he enjoys walking, reading, watching films and listening to an eclectic mix of music. His more active pursuits include a love of motorcycle sport, motocross and motorcycle racing. Since , he has been Race Chaplain to the Motor Cycle Union of Ireland. He also enjoys gardening and bee keeping.

The former DUP leader said he had taken legal advice which meant he could order the checks to stop without the approval of the Northern Ireland Executive. His party are opposed to the Northern Ireland Protocol, which had been agreed by the EU and the UK in order to ensure the free movement of trade across the Irish border after Brexit. However, unionists, who believe the arrangements are damaging to Northern Ireland’s position within the UK, have been critical. Currently, checks on goods from Great Britain must take place at Northern Irelands ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, Mr Poots believes the checks are unlawful and should not continue without the Executive’s approval. Today, Mr Poots said legal advice he had received confirmed that the implementation of Sanitary and Phytosanitarychecks required approval from the Stormont Executive. This meant he was able to direct the checks to cease, and that at a result a formal instruction had been issued to DAERA’ss permanent secretary to halt all checks not in place on December ,  as of midnight tonight.

He said it told him that approval for the sanitary and phytosanitarychecks at ports had not been obtained from the Executive, that Executive approval was required and that “a decision to initiate or continue such checks could not be validly taken in the absence of Executive approval”. The DUP minister said the advice said that “I can direct the checks to cease in the absence of Executive approval”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up When Mr Poots previously sought to stop work on building border posts in September , Ms King’s legal advice to the Executive led Mr Poots into a rapid U-turn where he allowed the posts to be built.As reported by this newspaper on Saturday, Ms King’s firm advice at the time was that such action would be unlawful on multiple levels and civil servants would not have to follow an order to break the law. Although the situation now dfers from  in several respects, the core part of the dispute is essentially unchanged.On Friday the FDA, the union which represents senior civil servants, wrote to the head of the Civil Service, Jayne Brady, requesting that officials be given “clear unambiguous guidance in the event of ministers issuing reckless and potentially illegal instructions”.At issue are two conflicting interpretations of the legality of Irish Sea border checks. The DUP argues that in the absence of explicit Executive authorisation for the checks, they are unlawful because the Good Friday Agreement requires all signicant or controversial decisions to be cleared by the Executive.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBrenda King.

Credit: Executive Office NIBut Ms King’s advice — which is accepted by Sinn Féin, the SDLP and Alliance — is that the protocol is a binding legal commitment, both in domestic and international law.That dispute could have become academicthe Government had countermanded Mr Poots using its powers under the Northern Ireland Act . However, echoing what Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told this newspaper last week, on Wednesday night Secretary of State Brandon Lewis indicated that will not happen, saying that it is a “matter for the Northern Ireland Executive” and “within their legal remit”.Related topicsEdwin PootsThe Executive OfficeSinn FéinSDLPAlliance PartyBrandon LewisNI ProtocolMore On Edwin Poots PremiumDiane Forsythe was the best candidate and I wish Edwin accepted it: Sammy WilsonPoots warned ending checks at ports ‘breaks global treaty’ PremiumAction is clearly needed on climate change, but farmers fear they’ll reap a bitter harvest‘Disappointing’ Edwin Poots has not ‘accepted’ South Down candidate selection, claims party colleague Sammy WilsonHalt to post-Brexit NI Protocol checks ‘matter for Executive’ as Brandon Lewis confirms UK won’t interveneMost ReadPervert Davy Tweed at centre of alleged buried baby probe after wooden cross foundHalt to post-Brexit NI Protocol checks ‘matter for Executive’ as Brandon Lewis confirms UK won’t interveneTeenagerwho raped his girlfriendavoids prison sentenceFire at former Game of Thrones set in Northern Ireland ‘controlled burning’, confirms fire serviceCondolences offered to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following the death of his brother AndrewTop VideosPlayLook inside Northern Ireland#s Game of Thrones Studio TourPlaySinn Fein MLA John O’Dowd responds as Edwin Poots orders halt to Brexit checks at Northern Ireland portsPlayCCTV: Gunman flees Belfast Danny McClean murder scene in fresh police appeal footageLatest Northern IrelandNI Protocol: Checks on goods expected to stop on Thursday‘Still no closure’ for family of Jenner Dornan six years on from her murderMan found dead at lough was killed as associates didn’t trust him to stay silent, senior detective tells inquestCase of murdered Seamus Maguire added to the list of DisappearedStudent numbers drop at Magee despite countless commitments to expandLatestSnow and freezing rain as storm moves across USNI Protocol: Checks on goods expected to stop on ThursdayWhat the papers say – February Derek McCallan: ‘Local government was never sexy... bins, bogs and burials’Professional snowboarder Aimee Fuller: ‘I’ve found my passion... a lot of athletes leave their sport and find they’re lost’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is unrealistic and can only be met by cutting livestock numbers on local farms, and even by doing that, it would still not solve climate change,” Mr Chestnutt continued.Instead, it will export our food production overseas to meet consumer demand for meat and dairy products, where emissions are higher and standards are lower.”After a y Assembly debate, the vote for the net zero target, which passed by  to , came during the latest stage of a bill to tackle climate change.It was supported by the Greens, Sinn Fein, SDLP and Alliance but Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots argued instead for a target of reducing emissions by % by .He accused other parties of ganging up on rural communities after the vote passed, with the DUP and UUP opposing the plan.Mr Poots said he is going to attempt to make further amendments to the bill which will mitigate the impact on the agricultural sector - and potentially leave them out of the net zero target altogether.The % figure is being passed as a headline but may not be fulfilled, Mr Poots added. The consequences are hugely damaging, he said. I have to find a means of undoing the damage.Ms Bailey believes the agriculture sector should not be left out of any net zero targets.Speaking on BBC’s Good Morning Ulster radio show, Ms Bailey said: The agriculture sector is our highest emitter. We know that farmers want to do better. In Northern Ireland, despite being a small region and a small population we actually emit double our per capita in terms of emissions - more than China.“Every single job that is linked to farming in some way will be impacted, as well as jobs in rural areas that depend on business from agri-food workers. Jobs are needed to sustain rural communities,” added Mr Chestnutt. He noted that farmers lobbied MLAs and commissioned KPMG “to conduct the economic impact assessment on the far-reaching consequence of the Private Member’s Billon agriculture and rural communities”.The UFU urged MLAs “to think again when this Bill comes back to the Assembly for further consideration at the next stage and for the many that supported the net zero target but made a commitment to us that they would ensure nothing would be done that would harm agriculture or reduce livestock numbers, to deliver on their promise!”Most ReadPervert Davy Tweed at centre of alleged buried baby probe after wooden cross foundHalt to post-Brexit NI Protocol checks ‘matter for Executive’ as Brandon Lewis confirms UK won’t interveneTeenagerwho raped his girlfriendavoids prison sentenceFire at former Game of Thrones set in Northern Ireland ‘controlled burning’, confirms fire serviceCondolences offered to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson following the death of his brother AndrewTop VideosPlayLook inside Northern Ireland#s Game of Thrones Studio TourPlaySinn Fein MLA John O’Dowd responds as Edwin Poots orders halt to Brexit checks at Northern Ireland portsPlayCCTV: Gunman flees Belfast Danny McClean murder scene in fresh police appeal footageLatest Northern IrelandNI Protocol: Checks on goods expected to stop on Thursday‘Still no closure’ for family of Jenner Dornan six years on from her murderMan found dead at lough was killed as associates didn’t trust him to stay silent, senior detective tells inquestCase of murdered Seamus Maguire added to the list of DisappearedStudent numbers drop at Magee despite countless commitments to expandLatestSnow and freezing rain as storm moves across USNI Protocol: Checks on goods expected to stop on ThursdayWhat the papers say – February Derek McCallan: ‘Local government was never sexy... bins, bogs and burials’Professional snowboarder Aimee Fuller: ‘I’ve found my passion... a lot of athletes leave their sport and find they’re lost’,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

The winning schools each received pound of NIFQA beef and lamb, kindly sponsored by ABP Food Group.Livestock and Meat Commission education and consumer promotions manager, Sarah Toland, explained that one of the key drivers for the competition was to encourage the use of NIFQA beef and lamb in schools and to complement the organisationrsquos existing schools programme.ldquoWith this in mind we specically targeted food and nutrition teachers and their students when drawing up the criteria for the project, she said.Sarah congratulated the winning schools, noting that as the competition received an encouraging number of entries, to select the top three was no easy task.De La Salle teacher Irene Stokes said the competition helped increase awareness of the importance of sourcing local NIFQA produce.She added: ldquoThis competition allowed our students an opportunity to highlight the vital nutrients that beef and lamb provide and how both can add iety, colour,flavour and texture to any dish. ldquoOur students are also becoming increasingly aware of sourcing meats that have the NIFQA symbol and the impact this has on the local economy.Down High teacher Sharon McKee said the competition was a ldquofabulous way of encouraging students to consider the valuable contribution of red meat in their diet.She added: ldquoOur Year  pupils are currently investigating the nutritional and dietary needs of adolescence so this competition fitted well into our curriculum and brought the theory to le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe partnership to help map future  ","story":"THE first meeting of a new forum involving health chiefs, hospital campaigners, trade unions and politicians to oversee service provision at the Downe hospital is expected to take place in the spring.The South Eastern Trust mdash which is responsible for the hospital and the delivery of a raft of health and social services across the community mdash has described the creation of the new Downe Health and Care Partnership Forum as exciting.Last summer, South Down MP Chris Hazzard suggested to senior health chiefs that a new partnership involving a range of key players should be established to help map out the most appropriate model of health care for the area and it will soon become a reality.Health chiefs said the forum, which is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, said the two key objectives are to plan for the future with everyone who uses services in the area and work in partnership to improve the health and wellbeing of the community.The health trust said this is in line with the organisationrsquos so-called ldquoquality  all strategy which puts excellent care at the centre of what it does.Officials say the new forum will consider local population health and social care needs, support people to lead healthier lives and take action to reduce health inequalities.Health trust chief executive, Roisin Coulter, said the organisation wants to work collaboratively with the local community regarding existing health and social care services to plan and design for the future.ldquoWorking in partnership with a wide range of key stakeholders will be vital to the forumrsquos success.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in . It took over the vacant Albion clothing factory on the Antrim Road and at one point last year was employing  people.The number has been whittled away and will be reduced to  employees.The other two major employers have also been hit over the last four years. The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service.

Surveys have shown more people go racing on a Sunday than on any other day, he remarked.ldquoYet the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture last November rejected the appeals of deputations representation Downpatrick and Down Royal seeking an equal opportunity.Mr Duff said thatSunday racing is permitted, the law relating to gambling would have to be changed.Mr Duff added: ldquoEverybody in racing respects the views of people who may be against Sunday racing, but I donrsquot think they should be allowed to dictate to the majority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Matt.jpg","title":"Matthew survives on Dancing With The Stars  ","story":"LOVE Islander Matthew MacNabb survived the first public vote in RTErsquos Dancing With The Stars mdash despite gaining the lowest number of points.The Downpatrick man was faced with the challenge of dancing the jive on Sundayrsquos show, known to be notoriously dficult for tall male dancers.Standing at ft in, the  year-old admitted it was tough going, but was personally delighted with his effort with professional dance partner Laura Nolan.Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Matthew told the Recorder: ldquoI was happy with my dance last night as I had a nightmare with it all week trying to get the timing and coordination down.ldquoThat was the best I danced it and I worked so hard all week but I guess giraffes arenrsquot meant to jive.In the end, it was novelist Cathy Kelly who was the first celebrity to leave the show.The local GAA player and digital marketing consultant said he had been overwhelmed by the support and votes he had received.He said: ldquoTo be bottom and to get through shows how amazing people are to vote for me and I really appreciate it.

But then Don upped the pressure and the hosts dominated thefinal ends to run out - winners.On the other mat the home triple of Hilary Cavan, Robin Horner and Graham Christie were playing some great bowls against Paddy Murray and after lting a count of six on the third end would only lose three ends in their - win. At the break the home side had a -shot overall lead.The Saints made a slight comeback in the third game as Philip Woodside, David Anderson and Neil Brown continued their good run of form against Frances and Derek McCann and skip Alan Laughlin, who after losing the first two ends won the next three to go - up before Alan hit back to make it it - after seven ends.This would be as good as it would get as the visitors won the last three ends to finish - winners to secure the only away points of the match.A mention must go to this triple for playing and controlling this game so well, especially as Philip had a throwback to past times with the quality of lead bowls.The last game of the night saw Rose Marie Wylie, Davy Vance and Peter Christie score seven shots from the first two ends against Terry Quinn, Nigel Brown and Tony Ward.They never relinguished this lead as the game finished - in their favour to secure another great win.Surely now no-one can stop Spa from continuing on and finish the season unbeaten and as champions.DROMARA.....................

Dromararsquos Denis Kane, Richard Kelly and JamesMcKinney took control of their game against Haydn Tumelty, Dermot Rooney and Liam Higgins and even though they won only four ends and scored  shots to win -, this left Dromara with a five-shot lead in the overall.Owenbeg finally got going in the final game as Nathan Tumelty, Alan Telford and Collie Gibson really put Marie McNeill, Phil and Eamon Kelly to the sword.They only let their opponents score two shots as they scored steadily and heavily to run out victors by a - margin.It has to be said that Nathan was giving his team-mates an easy time with his standard of lead bowls on what are tricky mats.This win was enough to get Owenbeg the extra points and scrape an overall draw.ST MACARTANrsquoS...........

How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times. If you feel that you like to find out more about ways of real self care, developing good habits and creating change, you can contact me on  .For the month of January, I am offering free -minute assessment sessions.

Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph.

The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry.

She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13437254.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The firm’s chief executive Sara Venning and director of finance and regulation Ronan Larkin explained the funding pressures the company was facing during an appearance before MLAs on Wednesday.Mr Larkin said that since the last annual budget was set in April, energy costs and inflation had risen sharply.He said: “Since then we have seen high inflation. The regulator assumed inflation of .% almost a year ago.“We know that inflation is running at about .% and possibly rising.“On top of that there is increased energy costs which is likely to continue.“At one point in December, prices for gas-based electricity were running at about nine to  times what they had been a year ago.“Today, they are four to five times higher than they were a year ago. That is the dference we have to pay.”Mr Larkin told MLAs that, at the time of the October monitoring round, NI Water was facing a shortfall of £. million in its annual budget.He said the company was given an allocation of £. million in the monitoring round and then received further additional funding of £. million from the budget of the Department for Infrastructure.He added that NI Water generated savings of £. million and was given emergency funding of £. million in January by the Department of Finance.It then received an additional £ million in the monitoring round on January  to cover the period to the end of the current financial year.He said: “We tend to look at Northern Ireland Water as a public health facility here in Northern Ireland, it is government-owned and it is very dficult to continue to operate it on a piecemeal basis, particularly as funding looks like it might not cover the issues.“That is one of the things we have to look at, are the funding arrangements around Northern Ireland Water fit for purpose today “Are they able to underpin what is a public health utility ”Ms Venning: “It is very clear that we are in a period of upward inflation and that energy price increases are very signicant in terms of overall budgets.“That means there is a need for additional resource and these increases are inescapable.“That does bring conflicts when bids for additional funding are not met. Starving the business of investment leads to service disruption and service degradation.“Our experience between the October and January monitoring round was a stark example of that.”Committee vice chairman David Hilditch asked about the accuracy of information the committee had received before Christmas, that schools and hospitals would have to close unless additional funding was supplied to cover the NI Water shortfall in the financial year.Ms Venning said: “We prepared a consequence document and,you recall the gap between the October monitoring rounds was in the region of £ million.“The question that was put to us was what would happenyou don’t get the £ million and you must live within the RDELbudget “We examined our costs and set out a series of consequences. It was all around wastewater. We said we would prioritise drinking water.“It was a ridiculous exercise because the amount of money that was short, we would have had to shut down the entire wastewater part of our business and even then we wouldn’t have saved the full amount of money.“In shutting down the entire wastewater part of our business, that waste is flowing in pipes, there are no pumps to pump it on, it would have escaped.“Of course schools would have had to have closed,they can’t flush their toilets, and they can’t remove waste and they have no hygiene facilities.“It is hard to imagine any part of society that doesn’t have an impact.”UUP MLA Roy Beggs said: “Essentially you have been operating on fumes.“There was a bid in for October monitoring, which I understand was not successful.“You were potentially going bust.

Picture by Jonathan Porter PressEyeGiven that Warner Bros are involved and the studio has been given ‘official’ status I never thought it was going to be, but when you’ve spent the last few miles of the journey travelling behind a tractor it’s hard to conjure images akin to Disneyland.I came on the tour as someone who wouldn’t describe themselves as a fan of ‘Game of Thrones’, but somehow have managed to see almost every episode thanks to my we.I left completely blown away by what was on offer, which is why I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in TV and film, and not just GoT fans.Being able to get so close to the costumes and props gives you an appreciation of the painstaking detail that goes into making it. Focus is also given to what goes into building the sets, mapping the story, making the prosthetics, and generating CGI footage, and there’s plenty of interactive sections and photo ops.Visitors will easily become immersed on a tour that takes at least  minutes to savour.Although the show itself is known for its violent scenes, the good news for families is the tour is suitable for children aged five and up.Adult tickets cost £. and childrencost £.. Students, senior and family tickets are also available.Find out more at www.gameofthronesstudiotour——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I honour and respect my father and it was a learning for me as well.”The Presbyterian Church in Ireland has selected Rev John Kirkpatrick to be its next Moderator.Having already touched on the relevance of church in an increasingly secular age and relating to the community on LGBT issues, he reflected that “some of these other issues we have talked about as well are informed in my heart by living through a le that is not simple, living through a le that has a lot of mess in it”.He said such a le is “not just religious, it is not glossed over, so that has been helpful in my story but not easy.

Rev Kirpatrick related how he had actually been ready to retire this year but believed God directly guided him to take up the role of moderator.Pressed on declining church membership in a secular age, he said that he welcomed the process in that it reduced nominal membership and pressed those inside and outside the church to think carefully about their beliefs.He also related how Presbyterian membership in large parts of the Republic of Ireland is increasing. This he put down to “open” and “developing” churches adopting new formats to reduce barriers, community, a growing interest from people with “no faith”, a focus on hospitality and more emphasis on Jesus Christ as opposed to Presbyterianism.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe move was announced as the Conservative administration at Westminster prepared to publish its Levelling Up white paper.Prime minister Boris Johnson, who has come under fire as a result of the “partygate” allegations, will attempt to ert attention from the ongoing saga by insisting the “defining mission” of his government is to “level up” the country so people have “access to the same opportunities” regardless of where in the UK they live.Levelling up secretary Michael Gove is to invite Wales first minister Mark Drakeford, as well as his Scottish counterpart Nicola Sturgeon, and Paul Givan and Michelle O’Neill from Northern Ireland, to take part in the project, calling for the four nations to work together in the same way as they did in the Covid vaccine roll out.In addition, the Glasgow city region is to be one of three new Innovation Accelerator areas, and will receive a share of £ million of UK Government funding in a bid to encourage innovation and research and development work and boost local opportunities.Speaking ahead of the launch of the White Paper, the prime minister said: “From day one, the defining mission of this government has been to level up this country, to break the link between geography and destiny so that no matter where you live you have access to the same opportunities.”He added: “The challenges we face have been embedded over generations and cannot be dug out overnight, but this White Paper is the next crucial step.“It is a vision for the future that will see public spending on RD increased in every part of the country, transport connectivity improving, faster broadband in every community, le expectancies rising, violent crime falling, schools improving and private sector investment being unleashed.”.removeThe prime minister declared: “It is the most comprehensive, ambitious plan of its kind that this country has ever seen and it will ensure that the government continues to rise to the challenge and deliver for the people of the UK.”Mr Gove meanwhile described the UK as an “unparalleled success story with one of the world’s biggest and most dynamic economies”.However he stated: “Not everyone shares equally in the UK’s success. Great cities like Glasgow, Belfast, Swansea and Manchester, and proud towns from Aberystwyth to Armagh, to Bangor and Yeovil, have huge potential but contain inequalities which hold too many back.“Our ambitious plan to unite and level up the whole UK seeks to end that historic injustice and call time on the postcode lottery.”But he added: “We will only succeedall layers of government – UK, devolved, and local – work together.“We have seen through the success of the vaccine roll-out what we can achieve when we pull together.

one of the restaurants most popular and profitable dates.Alan, the manager of Casa De Margarita, said: \"You could have people over at your home, but you couldnt go to a restaurant.\"It was frustrating and we had a lot of cancelled bookings.\"The issue was compounded because the restaurant had stopped taking bookings, thinking that they were going to have the maximum amount of people in.However, Alan said that being on the Esplanade has helped the restaurant, especially as they have outside seating.He said: \"We have been lucky with the location.\"If its dry, then people go outside evenit is cold.\"However, he did go on to say that he was disappointed with the Vale Council for not offering more support, especially in the case of not allowing heaters for the outside seats.This is because heaters are not allowed on the pavements.Alan said it is too early to saybusiness is improving following the lting of restrictions.Pickfords Galley  Bar with RoomsPickfords Galley  Bar with Rooms has been open since January ,  - just before the beginning of the pandemic.Therefore, despite being officially open for two years, they have only been open to the public for about two months including before lockdown.Despite being closed for some time, the restaurant has still been able to operate a takeaway service and has taken the opportunity to develop slowly.Huw Pickford, one of the owners, said: \"Ithelped us grow and develop slowly.\"We opened sections slowly but surely.\"He credits the location on the Esplanade as being vital to keeping the new business afloat.\"The main thing that really helped us was the weather and the location,\" said Mr Pickford\"If we were one or two streets back then we wouldnt have survived.\"The restaurant is already highly regarded, with it being one of the highest rated restaurants in Penarth on Tripadvisor.At the same time as thriving as a new business during a dficult time for hospitality, Pickfords has carried out charity work for organisations such as the NHS.Mr Pickford is optimistic for the future and believes that the business will only grow further as restrictions are eased. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community -

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityPeople who suffer in childhood are also least likely to trust NHS information, wear masks during the pandemic or follow the rules, Welsh research has found.Adverse childhood experiencesinclude neglect, mistreatmentand growing up in a household affected by domestic violence, substance or alcohol abuse and other criminal justice problems.Parents separating or orcing, abandonment, or having a parent with a mental health condition are other examples of ACEs.The new study, published in the the open access journal BMJ Open, involved surveying , people aged  and over in Wales during lockdown restrictions .Experts looked at nine dferent ACEs as well as low trust in NHS Covid- information, whether people backed the removal of social distancing and mandatory face coverings, breaking Covid rules and vaccine hesitancy .While  per cent of those in the study had not experienced any childhood trauma, around one in five had suffered one type, around one in sixreported two to three, and one in reported four or more.The results showed that the more trauma people had experienced in childhood, the more likely they were to mistrust NHS Covid- information, to feel unfairly restricted by the Government and to support the end of mandatory face masks.The nine ACEs included in the study were: physical, verbal, and sexual abuse, parental separation, exposure to domestic violence and living with a household member with mental illness, alcohol and or drug misuse, or a family member in prison.People were twice as likely to break Covid rulesthey had four or more ACEs compared with none, while vaccine hesitancy was threefold higher with more than four ACEs compared with none..removeMore than four ACEs were also associated with a desire to scrap social distancing.Vaccine hesitancy was estimated at  per cent for those aged  to  with more than four ACEs, though older age groups were much more likely to have a vaccine. Overall, eight per cent of the entire study group would not agree to a vaccine.Around a quarter of all those in the study also admitted to at least occasionally breaking the rules.The authors concluded: “While pandemic responses should consider how best to reach those suffering from ACEs, longer term, better compliance with public health advice is another reason to invest in safe and secure childhoods for all children.”Previous research has suggested that mistreatment as a child may undermine trust in the future, including of health and other public services.The latest study suggested thatpeople had mistrust in one area, this was replicated in other areas.For example, four out of  people reporting low levels of trust in NHS Covid- information also reported vaccine hesitancy, compared with just six per cent of those who did trust this source of information.The study was funded by Public Health Wales and carried out by public health experts.This article originally appeared on our sister site The National. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

It is arguably one of the most important vessels in our maritime history.”His announcement came after a -year investigation of a number of th century ships in a two-square mile area off the US coast.The famous ship lay just  metres off the coast of Rhode Island, where it was “buried in nearly  years’ worth of sediment and silt”,  metres below the surface.However, an hour after Mr Sumption’s announcement, the Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Projectstepped in, labelling the announcement “premature” and a “breach of contract”.The executive director of RIMAP Dr Kathy Abbass fired back at the Australians’ claim, adding that RIMAP was the lead organisation for the study.In a statement provided toAustralia, she said: “There are many unanswered questions that could overturn such an identication .“RIMAP recognises the connection between Australian citizens of British descent and the Endeavour, but RIMAP’s conclusions will be driven by proper scientic process and not Australian emotions or politics.” vw,vw,px, px\"HM Bark Endeavour, a full-scale replica of Captain Cook’s ship, is pulled by a tugboat from Middlesbrough to its permanent home in Whitby .removeIn a statement on the ANMM website, Mr Sumption announced: “It is with great pride that after a -year program of archival and archaeological fieldwork that, based on a preponderance of evidence approach, I have concluded that an archaeological site known as RI , located in Newport Harbor, Rhode Island, USA, comprises the shipwreck of HM Bark Endeavour”.Since , maritime archaeologists had been investigating several th century ships in the underwater site.The findings, which are the joint work of the ANMM, the RIMAP and the Silentworld Foundation, will now be published and peer-reviewed by archaeologists from around the globe.“But for now, there’s a lot confidence that Endeavour has finally been found,” Mr Sumption said.The Endeavour was deliberately sunk in  in Newport Harbour by British forces around seven years after its key role in Cook’s first voyage to the Pacic.After chartering the oceans which were largely unknown to Europeans at the time, including the New Zealand coast and the east coast of Australia – where it narrowly avoided shipwreck on the Great Barrier Reef – the Endeavour was largely forgotten..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Researchers  uconfident u they have found James Cook us ship after two centuries article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The worlds only official Game of Thrones studio tour will open to the public on Friday, February . Picture by Jonathan Porter PressEyeGiven that Warner Bros are involved and the studio has been given ‘official’ status I never thought it was going to be, but when you’ve spent the last few miles of the journey travelling behind a tractor it’s hard to conjure images akin to Disneyland.I came on the tour as someone who wouldn’t describe themselves as a fan of ‘Game of Thrones’, but somehow have managed to see almost every episode thanks to my we.I left completely blown away by what was on offer, which is why I would recommend it to anyone with an interest in TV and film, and not just GoT fans.Being able to get so close to the costumes and props gives you an appreciation of the painstaking detail that goes into making it. Focus is also given to what goes into building the sets, mapping the story, making the prosthetics, and generating CGI footage, and there’s plenty of interactive sections and photo ops.Visitors will easily become immersed on a tour that takes at least  minutes to savour.Although the show itself is known for its violent scenes, the good news for families is the tour is suitable for children aged five and up.Adult tickets cost £. and childrencost £..

each other’s houses,” said LRG committee member Angeline. “Our families, especially children and grandchildren get involved in all sorts with us, from litter picks to planting for Ulster in Bloom and cleaning alleyways.“We also have around five regular volunteers who dedicate their time to helping us on specic projects.”Public artworksSince its inception, the group has spearheaded a large number of projects in Larne and the surrounding area - in particular, a range of public outdoor artworks.One of the groups projects was a pop up shop in colloboration with Larne Through a Lens and Mid and East Antrim Borough Council.The first of these during the pandemic was the ‘selfie’ frame, made by local resident Leslie King.Inviting visitors to take a snap of themselves and share on social media

Hall steps with the addition of colourful mosaic tiles.A collaboration with the council and the local Traders’ Forum, the artwork saw east Antrim artist Janet Crymble painstakingly craft the mosaic by inidually cutting, cementing and grouting tiles onto the steps over the course of a week.Murals pay tribute to key figuresOver the past number of years, Larne Renovation Generation has also been behind several local murals paying tribute to key figures in the town’s history.Actor, film-maker, musician and writer Richard Hayward is the subject of a large-scale artwork on Main Street, unveiled in .In addition to his travel writing, which opened up Ireland to the wider world, Hayward also filmed The Luck of the Irish in Glynn, and The Early Bird in Glenarm and Carnlough.In , the group added actress Valerie Hobson, who was born in Larne in , to the ongoing outdoor gallery.A mural of the Hollywood star, created by students from Larne Grammar School alongside artist Dean Kane from Visual Waste, can be seen at Point Street.The tradition of Irish festival dancing was in focus for a mural added to the town centre last year.The tradition of Irish festival dancing was in focus for this mural.Featuring a young Irish festival dancer with a background of one of Larne’s best known landmarks, the Chaine Memorial Tower, it is located on the gable wall of the Silver Lounge café on Main

Ballygally woman Jane Park.A board next to Thompson’s Lighting on Upper Main Street celebrates the fact that Larne was the first town in Ulster and Northern Ireland to get electrical street lighting.Other projects led by the group include a pop-up shop in collaboration with Larne Through a Lens, as well as a Halloween treasure hunt and family fun day.LarneFacebook  \"       \"   for the

The Ten TownsareaincludesAntrim, Armagh, Ballymena, Ballymoney, Banbridge, Coleraine, Craigavon ,Limavady,Derry-Londonderry, Newry and more than other towns and villages in the surrounding areas. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “The Utility Regulator forewarned us that energy price rises of this nature will continue because of exceptionally high global wholesale gas prices, however it is never good news for consumers when prices go up. This is going to put extreme pressure on many households as they try to pay their gas bills. “With the cost of energy continuing to increase, the Consumer Council is concerned about a potential rise in fuel poverty as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “We welcome firmus energy’s commitment to assist some of our most vulnerable consumers through support for the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme, but it is clear that energy companies including firmus, policy makers, The Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high fuel prices will be with us for years.” Consumers who are struggling with their energy bills or topping up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support. Consumers can also get in touch with the Consumer Council for free, independent advice by calling Freephone    or by emailingcontact@consumercouncil.org.uk.

The former DUP leader said he had taken legal advice which meant he could order the checks to stop without the approval of the Northern Ireland Executive. His party are opposed to the Northern Ireland Protocol, which had been agreed by the EU and the UK in order to ensure the free movement of trade across the Irish border after Brexit. However, unionists, who believe the arrangements are damaging to Northern Ireland’s position within the UK, have been critical. Currently, checks on goods from Great Britain must take place at Northern Irelands ports to make sure they comply with EU laws. However, Mr Poots believes the checks are unlawful and should not continue without the Executive’s approval. Today, Mr Poots said legal advice he had received confirmed that the implementation of Sanitary and Phytosanitarychecks required approval from the Stormont Executive. This meant he was able to direct the checks to cease, and that at a result a formal instruction had been issued to DAERA’ss permanent secretary to halt all checks not in place on December ,  as of midnight tonight.
