That was what happened.\u0027There were other kisses after that moment. She definitely made the first move and initiated the first act of affection in that way.\u0027Silverstein, who still lives in Los Angeles, said the duo had previously hugged and held hands but had never gone further until the actress, now 36, took matters into her own hands.Meghan later recounted the moment during a 2013 interview with Larry King, telling the veteran host: \u0027I was 13, it was a summer camp and I kissed him!\u0027Silverstein added: \u0027We had already become a couple. We had held hands prior - I\u0027ve always been affectionate, so we\u0027d already hugged. But the kiss was definitely her, her initiative absolutely.\u0027The teenage romance began after the pair met at a drama-focused summer camp organized by the Agape International Spiritual Center.Silverstein has grown up to be a star in the US as he is an actor, comedian and rapper who appears on The Late, Late Show.

Silverstein said that he believes Meghan will continue her activism work once she marries Prince Harry.

For me it was almost surreal being there. I\u0027d dreamed of seeing this shipwreck and it took years of experience both in ing and photography to be able to safely capture the images I saw in my mind.\u0027Peering inside windows to see a piano still in place or a card table and chairs next to a fireplace with a clock hanging above it and the galley with gold rimmed china still sitting on the shelf is pretty spectacular.\u0027According to Becky, not many ers have the privilege of visiting the Gunilda thanks mainly to its remote location, its depth 270ft  under the water and chilly 38f3c temperatures.And she said she needed a team of very well-trained ers to be able to make the trip a success.

According to witnesses, passengers had to pull the woman back into the aircraft when she was sucked towards the window and some of her body was drawn through it          This was the view from on board the Southwest Airlines flight of the blown-out engine after the plane made an emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport.

She later became an instructor, as the Navy did not allow women to fly in combat, and she finally resigned in 1993 when she joined Southwest Airlines. A mother-of-two, originally from New Mexico, Schults now lives with her husband Dean, a fellow pilot, in Fair Oaks Ranch, Texas.\u0027She has nerves of steel.

We started descending, made the turn back to Philadelphia. \u0027We were with one engine for maybe 10 minutes.                              Some of the crew couldn\u0027t hold back their horror... some were crying as they looked through the open window and onto the engine                        \u0027We decreased altitude from 8,000 to 5,000 and then when we finally landed it was relatively smooth, kind of a typical landing so the crew and the pilots did a fantastic job.\u0027 Passengers were taken from buses to the airport.  It is not the first time the malfunction has occurred on a Southwest-operated Boeing 737-700. In August last year, a different flight from New Orleans to Orlando was forced to make an emergency landing at Pensacola Airport in Florida after the casing surrounding one of its engines tore away at a similar altitude. On Tuesday, the airline manufacturer said it was aware of the accident and was prepared to cooperate with investigations. \u0027Boeing is aware of an incident with Southwest Airlines flight #1380. \u0027We are gathering more information and stand ready to provide technical assistance,\u0027 it tweeted.The engine which exploded is a CFM56 turbofan engine which costs  $10million and has a fan diameter of 68 inches. The engines are the most popular engines on single aisle commercial planes and are used by all of Airbus A320 aircraft.          One of the plane\u0027s engines exploded not long after it had left LaGuardia Airport in New York City on Tuesday morning. The damaged engine is visible above after the plane had landed          All of the other passengers on board were evacuated after the injured woman was taken away by paramedics           \u0027Heroes\u0027: Passengers thanked the five crew members on board for saving their lives. According to witnesses, the female pilot told them to brace for impact before she made the \u0027smooth\u0027 emergency landing  The plane was on its way from LaGuardia Airport in New York City to Dallas when it erted in the air and turned back on itself to go to Philadelphia. It was flying over western Pennsylvania at around 32,500ft at the time           The faulty engine was almost entirely exposed after the plane had landed The last time a passenger died in an accident on a U.S. airliner was 2009 when 49 people on board and one on the ground were killed when a Continental Express plane crashed on a house near Buffalo, New York.Southwest has about 700 planes, all of them 737s, including more than 500 737-700s like the one in Tuesday\u0027s accident. It is the world\u0027s largest operator of the 737. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.The National Transportation Safety Board says a preliminary examination of the blown jet engine  shows evidence of \u0027metal fatigue.\u0027In a late night news conference, NTSB Chairman Robert Sumwalt said one of the engine\u0027s fan blades was separated and missing. Sumwalt says the blade was separated at the point where it would come into the hub and there was evidence of metal fatigue. He said part of the engine covering was found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles west of Philadelphia. Southwest CEO Gary Kelly said in Dallas that there were no problems with the plane or its engine when it was inspected Sunday.The jet\u0027s CFM56-7B engines were made by CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines of France. CFM said in a statement that the CFM56-7B has had \u0027an outstanding safety and reliability record\u0027 since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aircraft worldwide.Last year, the engine maker and the Federal Aviation Administration instructed airlines to make ultrasonic inspections of the fan blades of engines like those on the Southwest jet. The FAA said the move was prompted by a report of a fan blade failing and hurling debris. But it was unclear whether the particular engine that failed on Tuesday was covered by the directives.\u0027There\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0027 said John Goglia, a former NTSB member. \u0027In this case it didn\u0027t. That\u0027s going to be a big focal point for the NTSB - why didn\u0027t (the ring) do its job?\u0027In 2016, a Southwest Boeing 737-700 blew an engine as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida, and shrapnel tore a 5-by-16-inch hole just above the wing. The plane landed safely.

International Mother Earth Day 2018 therefore falls on a Sunday.What is International Mother Earth Day?According to the UN, ‘International Mother Earth Day is celebrated to remind each of us that the Earth and its ecosystems provide us with life and sustenance’.The Day calls for the recognition of our collective responsibility to promote harmony with nature and the Earth ‘to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environmental needs of the present and future generations of humanity’.Harmony with Nature is the UN\u0027s initiative to get people and societies to reconsider their relationship with the Earth and the natural world to improve \u0027the ethical basis of the relationship between humankind\u0027 and our planet.          International Mother Earth Day coincides with another event raising awareness, Earth DayThe UN says the Day should be treated as an opportunity for people to raise public awareness about the challenges surrounding the well-being of the planet and all the life it sustains.In the UN resolution recognising the day, it says member states should acknowledge ‘that the Earth and its ecosystems are our home, and convinced that in order to achieve a just balance among the economic, social, and environmental needs of present and future generations, it is necessary to promote harmony with nature and the Earth’.Last year\u0027s theme was \u0027Environmental Climate Literacy\u0027 - whose aim was to establish a global citizenry that was \u0027fluent in the concepts of climate change and aware of its unprecedented threat to our planet\u0027.                                                    Why is it called International Mother Earth Day?The day is named so because Mother Earth, as it says in the resolution, is ‘a common expression for planet earth in a number of countries and regions, which reflects the interdependence that exists among human beings, other living species and the planet we all inhabit’.How did International Mother Earth Day start?The Day was created in 2009, when the General Assembly wanted to add another dimension  to, and way of achieving the balance between economic, social and environmental needs of current and future generations.Recognising that Earth Day was already celebrated in many countries on the same day, the UN decided to assign April 22 to International Mother Earth Day through resolution ARES63278. Underground radio station set up by son of Sports Direct boss Mike Ashley is pulled off air amid claims of sexual harassment, failing to fairly pay artists and tolerating \u0027homophobic\u0027 remarks Margot Robbie to star in Harley Quinn spinoff movie directed by Cathy YanKim Kardashian \u0027annoyed\u0027 by Kanye West\u0027s Twitter tribute to Lamar OdomInternational Mother Earth Day 2018: Everything you need to know When is Kardashian Family Feud on TV?

A threat made to keep her story about then-businessman Donald Trump under wraps While many aspects of Daniel\u0027s liaison with the now-president had already come out in the press – thanks, in part, to the 2011 interview she did with In Touch Weekly, which the magazine didn\u0027t publish until this January – it was details about this threat that became the headline out of her 60 Minutes interview last month.   \u0027I was in a parking lot, going to a fitness class with my infant daughter,\u0027 she explained. \u0027And a guy walked up to me and said to me, Leave Trump alone.

And then he was gone,\u0027 Daniels said. To 60 Minutes, Daniels said she did not report the encounter to police at the time because she was scared.She reiterated that point to The View\u0027s co-host Meghan McCain on Tuesday. \u0027I was scared, it was expressly what he told me not to do,\u0027 Daniels said of taking the threat to authorities. She also pointed out that if she had gone to the police a public record would have been produced and she likely would have had to explain that she had a previous alleged sexual encounter with Trump, which is why the threat took place.          Promos for Tuesday\u0027s episode of The View showed Stormy Daniels (right) sitting down with forensic artist Lois Gibson (left), who created the sketch           Stormy Daniels (left) sat down with forensic artist Lois Gibson (right) earlier this month and described the man she says threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011 \u0027Honestly one of the main reasons I didn\u0027t say anything is I didn\u0027t tell my husband at the time,\u0027 she said of her one night stand with Trump. \u0027To go home and say, I had this guy attack me, oh and by the way he did this because of this. I didn\u0027t want him to think I was a bad mom and I put our daughter in danger.\u0027 McCain asked why Daniels had never detailed the threat until the 60 Minutes interview, as the porn star had spoken off-the-record to news outlets, including ABC News, about her encounter with Trump, then running for president, in the weeks before the election.  The adult film actress replied that she didn\u0027t want to be asked the question McCain had just asked – why not call the cops?   \u0027I did tell quite a few people actually from back then,\u0027 Daniels then volunteered. \u0027I told family members and two friends and people that I worked with.\u0027  At that point Avenatti jumped in to say that there was no way his client could \u0027fabricate\u0027 the man\u0027s face. \u0027This is a very detailed sketch,\u0027 he said. He explained how the sketch had been made by a woman named Lois Gibson who often works with the FBI. \u0027She found Stormy to be very credible,\u0027 Avenatti added. Comey insists he didn\u0027t mock the size of Trump\u0027s hands in...Michael Cohen knows he could go to prison friend reveals as...Trump continues to struggle in search of new attorney to...Comey deepens mystery of \u0027classified information\u0027 that...Share this articleCo-host Joy Behar pointed out that the man \u0027looks like an actor, sort of.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s what stood out to me because I thought, honestly, that he was, you know, sort of handsome,\u0027 Daniels said.  Avenatti had planned to release the drawing publicly last week, but the raid of Trump attorney Michael Cohen\u0027s office and hotel room delayed the unveiling.  \u0027Due to the FBI raids of Mr. Cohen’s officehome and a subsequent request we received this morning to delay the release of the forensic sketch of the thug that threatened Ms. Clifford to leave Trump alone, we will not be releasing the sketch or reward details today. Timing TBD,\u0027 Avenatti tweeted last week after the Monday morning raid.Cohen was responsible for giving Daniels $130,000 in hush money in October 2016 in exchange for her signing a non-disclosure agreement that barred her from talking about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump. Avenatti has made a number of legal maneuvers to prevent Daniels from having to pay damages for violating the NDA, which the lawyer had argued is invalid since Trump never signed on as a party. Cohen, for his part, has said he paid Daniels personally, and Trump has backed that account up. \u0027Let me just say, I work in the adult business and I\u0027m a better actress than he is,\u0027 Daniels replied to a clip The View played showing Trump denying he knew about the hush money payment.  The longtime Trump fixer was in federal court Monday trying to prevent prosecutors from examining the content seized from the FBI\u0027s raid on Cohen\u0027s properties a week before. Daniels and Avenatti showed up at the hearing and then spoke to press waiting outside. \u0027For years Mr. Cohen has acted like he is above the law, he has considered himself and openly referred to himself as Mr. Trump\u0027s fixer. He has played by a different set of rules , or should we say, no rules at all,\u0027 Daniels told the crowd. \u0027He has never thought that the little man, or especially women, even more – women like me – mattered.\u0027 \u0027That ends now,\u0027 the porn star said. \u0027My attorney and me are committed to making sure that everyone finds out the truth and the facts of what happens, and I give my word that we will not rest until that happens,\u0027 Daniels said. Pointing to Daniels\u0027 appearance outside the courtroom today, McCain said she thought it looked like a publicity stunt, mentioning how Daniels seemed to be benefiting financially from the headlines, as she\u0027s embarked on a \u0027Make America Horny Again\u0027 strip club tour.\u0027Can I say, first of all, I did not name the tour,\u0027 she said, calling the name \u0027awful\u0027 and explaining how a strip club owner in the Carolinas dubbed her appearance there after the Trump campaign slogan. \u0027I\u0027m making more money, but I\u0027m spending so much more. My daughter, we have to hire a tutor now. And I have like bodyguards. You don\u0027t even want to know their food bill, because I have to feed them three times a day, and they are big,\u0027 Daniels said to laughs. \u0027Yes, I am dancing more, yes, I am making more money, but I am spending more money.\u0027 Daniels said that her ambition was not to move out of the adult film industry using the money from her scandal, but instead had wanted to keep growing as a director. \u0027I had a passion project of mine in the works for the last several years to direct a horror movie and those people that were my investors completely abandoned me,\u0027 Daniels said. Without a beat, Behar asked, \u0027Will Trump be in the movie?\u0027  McCain also asked what the end game was for the porn star.\u0027On a selfish note, it is my chance to defend myself and make people realize how and why this happens, so I can tell my side,\u0027 Daniels replied. \u0027That is my selfish reason, not going to lie about that part.\u0027  Avenatti chimed in too saying, \u0027We want the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\u0027  \u0027You should not be afraid or bullied,\u0027 Daniels added.  Stormy Daniels gives tell-all interview, poses nude for Penthouse | Page Six"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/07/4B4269A200000578-5627145-Matthew_Foster_a_meteorologist_with_the_National_Weather_Service-a-20_1524032729078.jpg","title":"Over 200 Hawaii residents airlifted Kauai flooding","story":"More than 200 people were airlifted to safety on Monday by the US Army, National Guard and the country, officials said    The storm, which hit Saturday, dumped 28.1 inches of rainfall in the small North Shore town of Hanalei, on the island of Kauai, in the  of 24 hours          Matthew Foster, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Honolulu, a storm is headed towards Kauai Wednesday night into Thursday  The second storm is expected to bring heavy rains, which could mean more flooding in areas that were already devastated by Saturday\u0027s storm  Damascus researcher lab destroyed after being hit by airstrikes8-year-old girl raped and murdered a wedding in IndiaBritish Laura Plummer filmed in Egyptian prison for first timeMoment Theresa May appears to roll her eyes at Jeremy Corbyn\u0027Why would I help her?\u0027 Cate Campbell admits to being selfishDramatic moment knife wielding cyclist is tackled by pedestriansTheresa May holds talks with her Jamaican counterpartBattered boyfriend Alex Skeel tells of his mental torture\u0027The mouth is for eating\u0027: Uganda\u0027s president warns against oral sexTerrifying moment surfer is mauled by four-metre great white sharkTwo surfers have been mauled by great white shark just hours apartFoster said the storm, however, won\u0027t stick around as long as the storm over the weekend did.

But could that simple habit really be turning my life into such a headache?It turns out it could. Bruxism — the medical term for the involuntary clenching and grinding of the teeth, usually during sleep — is soaring.

Normal chewing puts between 20lb and 40lb of pressure on your teeth, but grinding or clenching can exert a force equivalent to an astonishing 300lb.It’s enough pressure to crack a walnut shell — and teeth-grinders can be doing it for as much as 40 minutes of every hour they’re asleep.          According to my boyfriend, who had to contend with me making an awful gnashing noise in my sleep, I did. But could that simple habit really be turning my life into such a headache? (pictured: Lara King)No wonder it can take its toll on teeth, wearing them down and causing them to crack, break or become more sensitive.It’s also not uncommon for problems to surface in the neck, shoulders and back as the jaw muscles become so tight that pain is referred to other parts of the body.Teeth-grinding can even be behind a range of symptoms as varied as vertigo and hearing loss, by triggering inflammation in the inner-ear muscles.It can ruin your looks, too. ‘If someone grinds a lot you can sometimes see it in their face, because the muscles increase in size from overwork,’ says Dr Uchenna Okoye, aesthetic dentist and director at London Smiling Dental Group.‘It’s like building up your biceps with weights. You end up with more muscle mass in the face and jaw.’The result can be a square face, bulging hamster cheeks or ‘lantern jaw’ — a long, thin jaw with a prominent chin.          Dr Shivani Patel, of Elleven Dental in London, tells me there’s a strong genetic element (thanks for that, Mum) but that stress is usually the triggerA British Medical Journal study also found that a loss of lower facial height due to teeth wearing down can make you appear as much as 20 years older.With all of that to worry about, it’s a wonder we ever sleep at all.So what causes teeth-grinding? The experts are agreed: stress.Dr Shivani Patel, of Elleven Dental in London, tells me there’s a strong genetic element (thanks for that, Mum) but that stress is usually the trigger. Dr Patel’s practice has seen cases of bruxism rocket by 30 per cent in five years as our lives become increasingly high-pressured.Most of her patients are women, but Dr Patel has also started treating children as young as 11.She says: ‘When some people are stressed they break out in spots, or get rashes or stomach upsets. Others grind their teeth.’If you think a glass of wine before bed will relax you, think again. Not only does alcohol reduce deep sleep, making grinding more likely, but Andrew Eder, a professor at the UCL Eastman Dental Institute, says that acidic drinks such as prosecco and white wine soften enamel so it’s more easily worn away through grinding.For me, two-and-a-half years after that rather painful lunch, teeth-grinding is a nightly battle that has left me with a fissure in one tooth, a clicky jaw and bouts of neck stiffness, headaches and jaw pain.And while the experts say that a spell of stress is likely to have triggered my grinding in the first place, they also warn that once it starts, it can become habitual. When I visit Dr Patel, she tells me that it’s left a line of dentine (hard, dense, bony tissue) visible on the edges of my top and bottom teeth — showing that I’ve worn away the enamel.Enamel can’t be replaced, and losing it raises the risk of cavities, decay and infection. I take good care of my teeth and pride myself on having no fillings, so it’s infuriating that something I’m doing when I’m sound asleep is damaging them.Still, it seems I’m one of the luckier ones. Emily Mason’s grinding was so severe she destroyed one tooth entirely and had to endure a root canal treatment.Emily, a 37-year-old communications consultant from Wokingham in Berkshire discovered she was grinding her teeth three years ago. ‘I had a lot of pain in what seemed to be every single one of my teeth,’ she says. ‘My entire mouth was aching constantly. I felt like I was going mad, because I just couldn’t get to the bottom of what was causing it.’Her husband Chris, 36, hadn’t noticed Emily was grinding her teeth, but her dentist eventually spotted the signs. In an attempt to stop it, Emily had three of her molars filed down, as her dentist suggested it would make her bite more even and let all of her teeth take the force of the grinding, rather than just one or two. But it wasn’t enough.‘Things came to a head last year when I had to have a root canal.‘I had clamped my teeth so hard together on such a regular basis that I had stopped the blood supply to a tooth. I was mortified that I’d allowed the situation to get to that point.’Emily admits she’s a ‘natural worrier’, but says: ‘I’m not sure what triggered it. I work full-time and have two young sons — Archie, seven, and four-year-old Rufus — and I don’t live near my family, which means the school run, helping at Beaver Scout group and generally being a taxi service all falls to me.‘But that’s nothing out of the ordinary for most mums.’In an attempt to break the cycle, she is now having her teeth straightened at a cost of £3,500.‘My dentist told me many of his patients who have done this notice they’re clenching less,’ she explains.‘If the alignment isn’t perfect, people may grind and clench their teeth trying to find a comfortable way for the upper and lower teeth to sit together.’Her Invisalign braces — clear plastic aligners that sit snugly over the teeth — will also offer her some protection.‘They will create a barrier and stop my teeth from hitting one another when I do grind,’ says Emily.Mouthguards worn at night are most dentists’ first course of action — but they can do more harm than good. Experts warn that the soft plastic variety that can be bought over the counter actually encourage grinding by inducing a chewing response.Dr Okoye recommends patients have a hard ‘splint’ mouthguard custom-made at a cost of up to £1,000. But even at that price, it won’t last for ever.‘The hardest substance in the human body is enamel, and if that’s ground away there’s no manmade thing I can replace it with that you won’t chomp away at, too,’ admits Dr Okoye.And while guards shield the teeth from damage, they can’t stop the grinding action, so a guard won’t necessarily alleviate the other symptoms.In desperation, more and more women are turning to radical treatments — including Botox. Tracey Jones, 49, a personal assistant, has spent at least £3,000 over the past five years on chiropractors and physiotherapists to try to relieve agonising pain in her back, neck and shoulders.Two years ago, her dentist diagnosed bruxism and said it was likely she’d been grinding for over a decade. He gave Tracey, from Cheshire, a mouthguard, but she says it didn’t stop the muscles clenching.Tracey, who is married with two grown-up daughters, is now trying Botox. More commonly used to smooth away wrinkles, the chemical is injected into the skin where it partially paralyses muscles. The theory is that injecting it into the muscles in the jaw reduces their activity.‘I had the treatment in September,’ Tracey says. ‘It took just five minutes and the effects last up to six months — although it takes ten days to start working.‘Each session costs £550, but today I estimate that I’m 85 per cent better than I was before.‘I’m sleeping through the night without interruption and when I wake up I’m no longer in pain.‘Fortunately it hasn’t affected my ability to chew or eat as it affects a different set of muscles.’But experts are ided on the safety of Botox for teeth-grinding, pointing to evidence that it may eat away at the jawbone.Our bones constantly regenerate, and rely on impact and muscle movement to produce new bone cells. When the jaw muscle’s activity is reduced by Botox, it can’t push and pull the jaw as powerfully, hampering the process.One study suggests a single treatment could trigger a loss of bone density of as much as 40 per cent, increasing the risk of teeth becoming loose or even falling out.So how can you tell if you’re grinding? Professor Eder says to ask your dentist to look for the tell-tale signs: ‘You’ll normally see a white horizontal line inside the cheeks, just adjacent to where the teeth meet, in people who are actively grinding.‘You may also see indentations on either side of the tongue.‘Eventually, worn teeth can become more sensitive, get sharp at the edges, chip and become shorter.’ Ultimately, the question remains: How do we stop something that we’re doing while we’re asleep?Perhaps part of the answer is not worrying about it too much. Dr Okoye says: ‘We used to try to cure people of teeth-grinding, but we now realise we can’t. It’s para-sympathetic, meaning it’s unconscious and involuntary — like breathing, or your heart beating.‘Instead, what we can do is protect the teeth with a mouthguard and give people tools to change their behaviour by learning to manage their stress. These can be as simple as sticking Post-It notes around your house saying “relax”.‘Many patients won’t realise how tense they are until they see that sign and consciously loosen up.‘Everyone wants some sexy, difficult treatment. But it really is just a case of stress management and creating an awareness of how important it is to relax.’As for me, I’ve decided to see if a mouthguard can help put an end to my waking nightmare — and to try not to let the daily grind wear me (and my teeth) down any longer."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/16/22/4B3A0DE600000578-0-image-a-67_1523912929566.jpg","title":"The 200 000 dogs overfed got arthritis","story":"    Labradors and golden retrievers are most commonly treated for the condition, which causes painful, inflamed joints (file photo)Man, 22, is arrested and charged with \u0027stealing Gus the...Owner returns home to find her delighted dog playing in a...Share this articleThe study by the Royal Veterinary College said neutering also made pets more prone to arthritis, possibly because it cuts off sex hormones that may protect against it.Being above average weight for their breed made dogs 2.3 times more likely to have arthritis diagnosed, while males were 1.2 times more likely to have the condition than bitches.

Institute in Canada asked 34 people to copy simple melodies created at random by computer and to sing an ascending scale, hitting the highest note possible, as well as a descending scale to the lowest note they could reach.Excluding the six people who could not whistle, the results show people\u0027s singing was less precise than their whistling.The study, led by Dr Michel Belyk, from Bloorview

\u0027tone deaf\u0027- who are notable in their poor abilities as singers.\u0027However, tone deafness is a misnomer, as these iniduals do not necessarily have a deficit in hearing musical sounds, but

study help to explain why even virtuoso opera singers cannot match musical instruments like the violin for perfect pitch. While humans have a direct pathway from the brain to the larynx not seen in other great apes, they seem to have problems using it completely accurately.The study authors recruited people who self-identified as good and bad singers to copy the two sets of 45 melodies created by computer within a single octave. They did so in a sound chamber with a microphone, with software picking up mistakes in their ability to match the notes they heard.The results show people who could whistle precisely were also better able to sing precisely. Notes which were sung, using a single vowel rather than words in the study, were more likely to be flat and whistled notes to be sharp.World\u0027s first singing road that plays German regional anthem...Share this articleBut c, according to the research published in the study Royal Society Open Science.The study states:

paedophiles were going to more extreme lengths to view content - with the charity locked in an ‘arms race’ against abusers.Analysis revealed that the number of disguised websites, which are harder for authorities to track, had rocketed by 86 per cent.The deputy head of the IWF warned the fact that young people were being exposed to more graphic content online could play into the hands of child abusers.Children’s charity the NSPCC said that the dark web and the use of disguised websites were ‘fuelling’ child abuse and allowing predators to offend at a ‘mass scale’.EXCLUSIVE: \u0027He should never have been allowed back to his...Share this articleDisguised websites can only be accessed if a specific online pathway is followed. For example, a person would be directed to a hidden page from a forum discussing child abuse. But if another web user, who has not been on a child abuse site previously, clicks on the page, they could come up with legitimate adult content instead.The problem is booming with the rise of technology and a ‘comprehensive strategy’ required to stop ‘offenders in their tracks’, the NSPCC has said.A spokesman said: ‘Social networks must ensure that they prioritise child protection and we need the Culture Secretary, Matt Hancock, to step in and end the Wild West of the Web.’ The IWF found 78,589 URLs featuring disturbing content last year - a 37 per cent rise compared to 2017. The number of child sexual abuse websites had also exploded by 112 per cent.The figure had soared partly because its staff had become better at finding the horrific content, the charity said. Every seven minutes, the IWF finds footage of a child being sexually abused.          The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF), which produced the report, said there are more sites hosting child abuse than ever before - soaring by 37 per cent in the last year - with the NSPCC calling on Culture Secretary Matt Hancock to ‘step in and end the Wild West of the web’Fresh imagery was being regularly produced in addition to the historic content being shared again and again.Alarmingly, the charity is also finding more videos of children aged 11 to 15 who create footage of themselves on a webcam and then share it online.‘The amount of content that is out there is always growing, it’s never going to reduce,’ the IWF’s deputy CEO Mr Langford said.Around a third of the material uncovered featured the most severe abuse - category A which includes the rape and sexual torture of children.People were ‘seeking out something just a little bit more extreme’, Mr Langford said, adding: ‘Once the demand is there, the supply follows.’ Writing in the report’s foreword, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said there was ‘clearly more we need to do’, while noting that there was ‘worrying rise’ of material hosted in Europe.Offenders were ‘exploit(ing) new vulnerabilities in the online environment to evade detection’, she said. ‘We will continue to work together in our efforts to rise to this challenge and to evolve with it as we look to ensure the UK’s response remains as strong as it can possibly be,’ she added.Her comments came as IWF’s research found that 65 per cent of child sex abuse imagery was being produced in Europe - with the Netherlands as the top host.Mr Langford, IWF’s deputy chief, said abusers were ‘goading’ each other on through the web to post more graphic content with more extreme images granting greater ‘kudos’.‘In the same was as I suppose an international drug deal might say I’m shipping more drugs than you...These people have got that same sort of mentality…It becomes: “I’ve got more extreme content that you”,’ he told the Mail.Susie Hargreaves, chief executive of the Cambridge-based charity, said: ‘This year we’re seeing offenders getting smarter and finding new ways to abuse legitimate internet services.’ She said it was ‘concerning’ that more disguised websites were being used to evade the authorities.‘We are making huge technological advances, which we’ll be announcing later in the year, but we also need to continue to work globally, in partnership, to fight this disturbing crime. This battle cannot be won in isolation,’ she added."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/06/4B45781300000578-5628465-image-m-42_1524028623413.jpg","title":"Is Stormy Daniels hinting secrets come","story":"    Stormy Daniels has sparked a new controversy - this time with her choice of jewelry           The porn star has sparked a flurry of conspiracy theories after she wore a silver key pendant during her latest appearance on The View on Tuesday          She was on the show to discuss her alleged affair with the presidentOn Monday, she wore the same key necklace as she attended the court hearing for Michael Cohen, the lawyer who is accused of paying her off to keep quiet about her alleged affair with President Trump.Some people are questioning whether the porn star, who claims she had a secret affair with Trump while his wife Melania was pregnant with their son Barron, are hinting that there is more to come out in the scandal.Others suggest it could be showing that she plans to keep the remaining details under lock and key. Continuing to weather the Stormy! First Lady Melania Trump...Stormy Daniels\u0027s Penthouse cover is revealed as she poses in...Share this article    On Monday, she wore the same key necklace as she attended the court hearing for Michael Cohen, the lawyer who is accused of paying her off to keep quiet about her alleged affair with President Trump          Her necklace featured a long silver key which appears to feature the Mars male symbol and a key tipWhile one Twitter user suggested that the necklace could be suggesting that the courts should lock up attorney Cohen, and that she could be the key.Whatever the reason, it appears Daniels still has plenty to say about Donald Trump.On Tuesday on The View, Daniels unveiled the sketch of the man she says threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011, after she tried to publicize her story about an alleged affair with Donald Trump.  She told the panel that the man approached her as she was getting her infant daughter out of the car to attend a mommy-and-me exercise class.\u0027I noticed him because he was sort of well-dressed and nothing about him alarmed me,\u0027 she told the women in her first live television interview since the hush money payment given to Daniels by President Trump\u0027s lawyer Michael Cohen was unveiled. \u0027I really thought he was somebody\u0027s husband not wanting to be in whatever his wife was doing.\u0027            Upon unveiling the sketch, Daniels\u0027 attorney Michael Avenatti said they would pay a  $100,000 reward for the identity of the man, and asked for tips to be sent to IDTheThug@gmail.com. \u0027We want to get to the bottom of who this is, and we think we know who this is, but we want to confirm it,\u0027 Avenatti told The View\u0027s audience. Stormy was also at the court hearing for Trump\u0027s lawyer Cohen on Monday.Cohen was responsible for giving Daniels $130,000 in hush money in October 2016 in exchange for her signing a non-disclosure agreement that barred her from talking about her alleged sexual encounter with Trump. Avenatti has made a number of legal maneuvers to prevent Daniels from having to pay damages for violating the NDA, which the lawyer had argued is invalid since Trump never signed on as a party. Cohen, for his part, has said he paid Daniels personally, and Trump has backed that account up.           Porn star Stormy Daniels is photographed entering the studios for The View, as she gives her first live television interview           Porn star Stormy Daniels revealed the sketch that was made of the man she says threatened her in a Las Vegas parking lot in 2011, after she went to the press with her story of having sexual relations with then-businessman Donald Trump \u0027Let me just say, I work in the adult business and I\u0027m a better actress than he is,\u0027 Daniels replied to a clip The View played showing Trump denying he knew about the hush money payment.  The longtime Trump fixer was in federal court Monday trying to prevent prosecutors from examining the content seized from the FBI\u0027s raid on Cohen\u0027s properties a week before. Daniels and Avenatti showed up at the hearing and then spoke to press waiting outside. \u0027For years Mr. Cohen has acted like he is above the law, he has considered himself and openly referred to himself as Mr. Trump\u0027s fixer. He has played by a different set of rules , or should we say, no rules at all,\u0027 Daniels told the crowd. \u0027He has never thought that the little man, or especially women, even more – women like me – mattered.\u0027 \u0027That ends now,\u0027 the porn star said. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/08/4B4602F600000578-5628685-image-a-30_1524036420797.jpg","title":"Dig sunglasses Britain set sizzle 77F heat TODAY","story":"    The days sun rises over Bournemouth from Durley Chine Cliffs, Dorset. Britain is set to bask in sizzling temperatures as high at 77F (25C) today - the hottest day of the year so far          Met Office meteorologist Mark Wilson said: \u0027It\u0027s going to be a pretty nice day - it will be a slow start in places with cloud first thing.\u0027 Pictured is sunrise over east London this morning          Temperatures are to rise 55F (13C) above the average for this time of year - and the Met Office has confirmed that today\u0027s predicted 77F in the South East (London today) will make it the warmest day of 2018 so far          A 1,500-mile wide front of hot air branded as the \u0027blowtorch\u0027 will reportedly see the hottest April day in a decade before heating up later on in the week.

User @huonoliver, who visited the cafe, was surprised by the presentation. Commenting it was “tasty but ridiculous” he posted a picture to his account. That was picked up by Brown Cardigan which ran a photo, hashtagged #notmyvegemite, and Reddit lit up with talk of the latest in deconstructed food.One article scolded “Give yourself an uppercut, Sydney,” and Novocastrians were for once hesitant to correct. So Guardian Australia decided to do a taste test.Ordering at Core Espresso brought instant suspicion. In this heightened climate it felt like asking for tickets to a peep show. The head barista, Danni Kerr, had just taken a call from local radio, network news was circling and websites were calling the dish “beyond ridiculous”, the final frontier in hipsters disappearing up their own self-indulgence.“So, one Vegemite on toast then?” Kerr asked.They’ve stopped using wooden boards to serve the dish. There were complaints, Kerr said, that condiments on boards were “unhygienic”. As the now famous toast clunked down before Guardian Australia on a plate, it was hard to shake the feeling of arriving in Pisa to find a long-overdue program of corrective works.Aside from “that is a disgrace” and “looks like the chef slipped on a dog turd”, critics claim the extra time it takes to distribute one’s own butter and Vegemite must surely deplete crucial toast warmth, resulting in an unmelted disappointment.This can be debunked. Rather than the kind of butter that spreads like Gumption, this stuff is shaped in a quenelle.  The diner may find him or herself lathering on too much butter (seven bucks is seven bucks) which, like a gambler chasing his losses, he must then match with Vegemite.Guardian Australia was overcome by the dosage. Kerr nodded knowingly.“Everyone has a very specific ratio of Vegemite, butter and toast. That’s the idea,” she said.  “There’s lots of very offended people but it’s just toast. Come on.” The price is hard to swallow but justified by the sourdough. It is at once crispy and soft and sourced from a Vietnamese bakery. And then there are the sprinkled “micro herbs”.Earlier Guardian Australia took the precaution of making its own version of the dish – a sort of a placebo in this highly scientific test.The available Woolies loaf at home tasted as brown bread does. The old Vegemite jar was swirled with margarine and a shard of breadstick, like the tusk of a mammoth preserved in tar.A nub of fridge butter melted pleasingly into the toast. A few leaves of rocket stood in for the micro herbs but were quickly discarded.If food is there to switch off the brain signal that says “hungry”, a homemade Vegemite toast will do. But there are those who see a Jackson Pollock and declare “I could make that!” Maybe on canvas, plate and board, some of us are destined to miss the point.Core Espresso Vegemite toast for $7.

In an audio recording of the exchange with air traffic controllers, the crew member is heard to say the plane needs to slow down and an unidentified crew member reports that there is a hole in the plane and “someone went out”.Riordan was well known in New Mexico, where she had built a career over more than two decades in community relations and communications after graduating from the University of New Mexico. Gov Susana Martinez called her “an incredible woman who put her family and community first” and said her loss would be felt across the state.“The hearts of all New Mexicans are with the Riordan family,” Martinez said in a statement on Tuesday. In an email to parents, Amy McCarty, the assistant principal of Albuquerque Catholic school, wrote: “The family needs all the prayers we can offer.”Passengers praised the pilot who brought the plane to safety. Alfred Tumlinson, of Corpus Christi, Texas, lauded Tammie Jo Shults and her crew for their professionalism. “She has nerves of steel. That lady, I applaud her. I’m going to send her a Christmas card I’m going to tell you that with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground. She was awesome.”Shults was among the first female fighter pilots in the US military, according to friends and the alumni group at Shults’ alma mater, MidAmerica Nazarene. Her brother-in-law, Gary Shults, said her husband was also a Southwest pilot and told him she had made the emergency landing. “She’s a formidable woman, as sharp as a tack,” said Gary Shults, a dentist in San Antonio. “My brother says she’s the best pilot he knows. She’s a very caring, giving person who takes care of lots of people.” Passengers said she walked through the aisle and talked with them to make sure they were OK after the plane touched down. The US transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, extended her sympathies to the Riordan’s loved ones and praised the pilot, crew and others who were onboard. “I commend the pilots who safely landed the aircraft, and the crew and fellow passengers who provided support and care for the injured, preventing what could have been far worse,” Chao said in a statement. The US National Transportation Safety Board chairman, Robert Sumwalt, said it was the first passenger fatality in an accident involving a US airline since 2009. A preliminary examination of the blown jet engine has shown evidence of “metal fatigue”, according to the board. Tracking data from FlightAware.com showed flight 1380 was heading west over New York’s southern tier at about 32,200ft and traveling at 500mph when it abruptly turned toward Philadelphia.Amanda Bourman, a passenger from New York, said everyone started shouting to brace for impact when the plane started to land. Everyone clapped and praised the pilot after she set the aircraft down.“I just remember holding my husband’s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed. And the thoughts that were going through my head, of course, were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again.”She said she was seated near the back of the plane and was asleep when she heard a loud noise and oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling. She said the plane was fairly quiet because everyone was wearing a mask. Some passengers were in tears and others shouted words of encouragement.“You had a few passengers that were very strong,” she said, “and they kept yelling to people, you know: ‘It’s OK, we’re going to do this.’”Bourman said she also saw a man in a cowboy hat rush to cover the broken window and that the man had a bandage around his arm after the plane landed.Riordan was the vice-president for community relations at the Wells Fargo bank and was in charge of managing employee volunteer and board service to non-profit groups in New Mexico and parts of Texas. She also served on numerous boards and oversaw the annual United Way community campaign. The Albuquerque mayor, Tim Keller, said his thoughts and prayers were with Riordan’s family. “Today, Albuquerque lost a thoughtful leader who has long been part of the fabric of our community,” Keller said in a statement.

Over the last five months, the financial strength of retailers and other tenants in the UK has softened and a number of retailers have entered into administrations or CVAs, while consumer confidence has also remained subdued. It’s an embarrassing u-turn for the company, which really ought to have spotted such problems in its own sector.But given the recent collapse of Toys R Us and Maplin, and profit warnings at Debenhams and Mothercare, it also feels like the right decision.There are red faces at banknote printer De La Rue this morning, as it counts the cost of the ‘Brexit blue passport’ farrago.De La Rue has abandoned its attempt to appeal against the decision to award the contract to print Britain’s new bank notes to French-Dutch rival Gemalto. In an unscheduled announcement to the City, De La Rue hit shareholders with a profits warning - the second in a month - and revealed it is taking a £4m hit on the UK passport contract.The company, which also makes the new polymer bank notes, warned that underlying operating profit was now expected to be in low to mid £60m range for the year to 31 March. It followed a profits warning less than month ago, when De La Rue predicted profits of between £71m and £73m.Today’s UK inflation report could send traders racing to buy, or sell, the British pound.It all depend whether the data make an early interest rate rise more likely, as Konstantinos Anthis, Head of Research at ADS Securities, explains:Inflation in Britain is one of the key data investors and traders are following as it relates to how fast and aggressively the Bank of England will hike rates. We know that the BoE want to raise their key interest rate levels during their next two meetings but the actual timing of the move is still under debate.The pound’s price action largely depends on when market participants believe the British central bank will pull the trigger and the pace of inflation is key in gauging when this will be.The pound is trading at $1.429 this morning - a weak inflation report could send it sliding to $1.425, Anthis says.Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the global economy, the financial markets, the eurozone and business.Inflation is centre-stage today as we find out how the cost of living changed in the UK and the eurozone last month.The data may also influence the chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates next month, which has already driven the pound to 22-month highs yesterday.Jasper Lawler of London Capital Group explains:Weak eurozone inflation is great for consumers in the region, of course, but it could also make it harder for the European Central Bank to end its massive money-printing Quantitative Easing stimulus programme this autumn.The International Monetary Fund’s Spring Meeting is continuing in Washington two new reports on the state of the global economy will be released later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/842d53ec0b22d54e6fa2f4ee2376121d8e8505dd/0_93_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c1bbbc39cdc0c397f5e747dc333f15a0 1240w","title":"chinese europe czech republic crony capitalism","story":"My country, the Czech Republic, has bent over backwards for President Xi, with little benefit to citizens or the wider economyThe scrapping of limits on Xi Jinping’s presidential term last month drew attention to the profound changes the Chinese leader has imposed on his country’s political system. But the significance of this move is global – and it concerns Europe in many ways. China has identified a “window of historic opportunity” for itself across the world. To make the best of this, so its logic goes, the country must be united and disciplined under a strong leader and supreme commander. Xi has been compared with Mao Zedong in that he’s created an entirely leader-centric political system – but to think this has consequences only for China risks missing the wider picture.In my country, the Czech Republic, we’ve seen up close how China intends to expand its reach. Central Europe is very much part of China’s ambition to “move to the centre of the world stage” – the expression used by Xi during last year’s Communist party congress. The basic tool China relies on is the Belt and Road initiative, a trade and infrastructure project ning Asia and Europe which encapsulates the regime’s overarching foreign policy goals, in what Xi has dubbed the “new era”.The Belt and Road initiative is often misunderstood in Europe, not least because it keeps changing its name from one confusing moniker to another. Originally called the New Silk Road in 2013, it soon changed its name to One Belt, One Road, only to be rebranded as Belt and Road, apparently because the word “one” sounded unduly hegemonistic. While layers of propaganda often make it impenetrable to outside observers, its impact is very real – and growing. The project has been showcased with pompous rhetoric and music videos, and more than 60 countries have agreed to join.But how has it affected us Czechs? I run a project that monitors China’s attempts to build its “smart” power through a nexus of business, political and media networks. In Europe, there’s arguably no fonder ally of Beijing than the Czech president, Miloš Zeman, a populist who was re-elected earlier this year. He is on record calling Xi his “young friend”, and Belt and Road “the most remarkable initiative in modern human\u0026nbsphistory”.A tipping point came in 2014 when the Czech government proclaimed that the country would aspire to become “China’s gateway to Europe”. This amounted to a major foreign policy change. It broke entirely with\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsppro-democracy principles and support for Chinese dissidents of Václav Havel, the hero of the 1989 Velvet Revolution who went on to become president. Havel saw clear parallels between the\u0026nbsppast struggles of dissidents behind the iron curtain in Europe, and those\u0026nbspof contemporary Chinese dissidents – in particular\u0026nbspthe Nobel peace prize winner Liu Xiaobo, whose Charter 08 declaration was directly inspired by Charter 77, the Czechoslovak anti-communist movement.With Zeman, the contrast couldn’t be starker. Here was the Czech Republic displaying total complacency about a regime that not only imprisoned Liu but denied him external medical help as his health dramatically deteriorated (he died last year). However, things went much further than just political signalling. By 2015, Zeman had named as his honorary adviser Ye Jianming, the chairman of a mysterious Chinese mega-company: CEFC, which had arrived in the Czech Republic promising billions of dollars of investments.CEFC embarked on what resembled a shock-and-awe buying spree, announcing it would scoop up stakes in travel services, an airline company, a brewery, a football club and a media group. It also lost no time hiring scores of former Czech elected officials, who often double as advisers at various ministries, or indeed within the presidential castle.As time passed, however, actual investments remained negligible. The few deals that did materialise were mostly real estate acquisitions.\u0026nbspThen last month, Ye suddenly ran into trouble in Beijing. News broke that he’d been arrested and come under investigation for financial irregularities. Prior to that, last November, the\u0026nbsphead of CEFC’s non-profit arm, the former Hong Kong politician Patrick Ho, was arrested in New York and accused of bribing presidents and government ministers in Africa.Ye’s disappearance obviously raised eyebrows in Prague. Zeman reacted by sending three close colleagues on a strange semi-private fact-finding mission to China. They came back with the information\u0026nbspthat the heavily indebted CEFC would effectively be\u0026nbsptaken over by the Chinese state, together with its Czech acquisitions. So much for the hopes that the company would save the Czech economy as a private investor.These awkward developments for Zeman have since prompted a debate about the wisdom of tying the country’s future to mysterious Chinese entities and to the Communist regime in Beijing.It might have helped to look more carefully before accepting Beijing’s embrace. Some of the metaphors Chinese media have attached to the Belt and Road project are revealing. They often call it “globalisation 2.0”, or the “New World Order”. What that vocabulary struggles to mask is that the whole endeavour is driven far more by politics than by markets.Deals are negotiated at state-to-state diplomatic summits. Open tenders are shunned. Contracts are awarded by political fiat. Ostensibly commercial companies put former politicians on their payrolls by the dozen. As it turns out, CEFC’s main investments in the Czech Republic weren’t economic, they were about buying up the loyalty of Czech officials. What China has\u0026nbspto show for itself in my country is hardly innovation. Rather, it has brought us a new take on age-old crony\u0026nbspcapitalism.• Martin Hala is a Czech academic in Prague and director of the China studies project Sinopsis.cz"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ed77415370f1beeb1449f373865a79a67632f4b/0_130_2800_1681/master/2800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d67b9c2a5e04a5f4f3faa6cf7e493893 1240w","title":"commonwealth global climate change new zealanders","story":"The task ahead is immense, but New Zealanders know it can be achieved. We have a proud history of this kind of leadershipLeaders of Commonwealth nations are meeting in London this week instead of the South Pacific nation of Vanuatu because things did not go according to plan. In 2015, cyclone Pam roared across Vanuatu, knocking out power, crippling water systems and levelling homes, schools and churches.In only 24 hours, the storm dashed the island nation’s hopes of hosting the Commonwealth summit. Three years later, many communities have yet to fully recover, in a place where the impact of a changing climate is on full display.Vanuatu is one of New Zealand’s Pacific neighbours and friends – and its experience is an increasingly common one. In February, Tonga was hit by its worst cyclone in decades, cyclone Gita. When I visited the country in March, I spent time with schoolchildren who were learning in tents – the roof of their school had been blown off and the classroom walls destroyed by the storm.Such extreme weather events are tragedies. They are also provocations. They tell us that climate change is not a theory, or a projection, but something that is already happening. They tell us we must be more ambitious when it comes to tackling this urgent global challenge.The Commonwealth heads of government meeting is a good place to start. Twenty-eight years ago, the same meeting produced the Langkawi declaration on the environment, among the first collective statements to cite greenhouse gas emissions as one of the chief problems facing the world. I am confident that this year’s gathering can be just as decisive by fostering bold commitments to step up climate action.And while the task ahead is immense, New Zealanders know it can be achieved because we have a proud history of leadership on challenges than can seem too hard to contemplate.We were the first country in which women won the right to vote, we were at the forefront of the anti-nuclear movement, and we were at the table when the United Nations was born. And we are ready to lead on climate change, the defining challenge of our generation.That is why my government has committed to setting an ambitious new target of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. In June, we are starting a consultation process on how to enshrine this commitment in law.Our plan includes an expert Independent Climate Commission which will develop carbon budgets through to 2050 – setting a path to carbon neutrality that maintains enough energy to run our economy and country. Along the way, we are committed to helping regions and industries directly affected by the transition move away from fossil fuels, with billions of dollars of investment in local infrastructure and clean energy projects on the horizon.We are also active in building international cooperation on climate action.Nearly half of New Zealand’s emissions come from our world-renowned farming sector. This is why we lead the 49-nation Global Research Alliance that is developing techniques to reduce agricultural emissions without compromising food security. And that is why we are committed to helping other countries achieve more climate-friendly agricultural production, in ways that will increase farmers’ yields and build resilience while reducing emissions.Alongside the UK, we belong to coalitions of forward-thinking countries and cities pressing to phase out coal generation, eliminate harmful subsidies that encourage wasteful fossil fuel use, and help our economies transition to carbon neutrality.The international consensus on climate change in Paris in 2015 was a historic achievement. Now we all need to do our part by delivering on what we signed up to.At this week’s Commonwealth meeting, I’ll be thinking about Vanuatu’s experience – and the summit that couldn’t happen. I’ll also be guided by a Māori saying from my country – Mō tātou, ā, mō kā uri, ā muri ake nei – for us and for our children after us.That is what’s at stake when we talk about climate change – the world we’ll leave for the generations that follow us. They are why we need to act now, with purpose and courage.• Jacinda Ardern is the prime minister of New Zealand"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2ac2920bf64bb33d21fd38cf0a73e50ec11d9b9/0_235_5180_3108/master/5180.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d4e2ddf444c719cff0f96b2dca795096 1240w","title":"lets banish the term arab world what does it mean anyway","story":"Labelling 381 million people from 22 countries as monolithic ‘Arabs’ is misleading and inaccurateWith conflicts raging on in Syria, Palestine, Yemen and Iraq and a diaphanous calm in the rest of the Middle East, the language we use in covering this region is not only hindering our understanding of the issues, but it is also misguiding strategic policies.As a journalist covering international events, I have witnessed the narrative covering the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) recede to a thin crescent of one pan-ethnic group, primarily because they speak a dialect of Arabic. At the last count, 35 dialects of the Arabic language are spoken across the two regions.In a recent discussion one person, referring to Iranians, used the term “Arab speakers”. I wanted to ask whether they were Dolby Digital or Stereo. Instead I pointed out that Iran’s language is Farsi. The BBC has an “Arab affairs” editor and it is not alone. Fellow journalists who are “internationalists” themselves make that mistake politicians, commentators and academics as well. This language does nothing to inform and only perpetuates a phantom identity of “Arabs” and the “Arab world”. Both terms are widely used as blanket coverage of the populace in the MENA that displaces the indigeneity of “Arab” into a single basket that mashes 22 countries with a population of 381 million. The MENA consist of many countries and each speaks its own form of Arabic patois, a clear indication of their nationality. Arabic in North Africa is almost incomprehensible to an Arabic speaker from the Levant such as Lebanon. In the case of Lebanon, their version is what I call frou-frou Arabic due to lasting French influences. Lebanon’s native language was Phoenician or Canaan, which was also spoken in coastal Syria, northern coastal Israel and Cyprus. Syria’s once native language that it shared with Iraq and Iran was Assyrian. The Egyptians spoke Coptic. The list goes on. During an assignment in Israel and Palestine, my Arabic dialect clearly defined my roots from the local Palestinians. The dialects differed wildly when I was in Egypt and even greater when dealing with Iraqis and Libyans. Not to mention cultural differences. As a Lebanese-Australian who lived in Libya as a child and then later worked for the Nine Network Australia during a Gulf war assignment in Saudi Arabia, I found both countries terrifying. They and their lifestyle were alien to me. Yet in this instance, the global membership I had been assigned, told me I belong to others. An otherness dictated by passersby.Lebanese biologist, Dr Pierre Zalloua, whose wide body of work includes the National Geographic’s Genographic project – an ambitious worldwide genetic mapping of human history – has a huge interest in this topic and has dedicated a lot of his work to deconstructing the misleading current definitions of identities in general. Zalloua says, “DNA is the most powerful tool that eradicated the word race and embraced the word ethnic background. It does not define or determine an identity, or culture or an ethnicity, it uncovers stories from our past but does not reveal who we really are.”In my initial contact with Zalloua for this story he cautioned that: “This is a very complex and convoluted topic, very politically charged. One has to have the courage to tackle and be truthful to the facts without prejudice.” And he was right. In researching for meanings, definitions and categorisations of the term or the regions, there are no definitive answers to populations, countries, sects and languages that accurately agree on what constitutes the MENA. There is no getting away from that ethnocentric mindset that mash-up countries, ethnicities, religions, cultures and languages by referring to the regions, not as the Arabic speaking world, not as the Middle East or North Africa, but as “Arabs” and the “Arab world.” We wouldn’t refer to Scotland, Ireland, Australia, Canada and the USA as “English” or the “English world” but most likely, the English-speaking world.Robert Hoyland, a professor of archeology and history at NYU, spent considerable time in Syria and Yemen until the wars started and now teaches at NYU in Dubai. He says that the first reference to the term “Arab” was in 834BC in the Bible and “the race existed in Syria below Palmyra and top of Saudi Arabia, ie, in the desert between them.”Before the regions were invaded by the “Arabs” from down south in the Arabian Peninsula, there were existing civilisations. The march north and conquest began in the mid-6th century, across the Persian and Byzantine territories and it was to spread the faith – Islam which was rooted in the Arabic language – not their ethnicity. The word “Arab” means “nomad” in one camp, in another it is derived from “pure or mixed”. Arabic originated from nomadic tribes in the desert regions of the Arabian Peninsula. The language comes from Nabataean Aramaic script and has been used since the 4th century classical era belonging to the “Semitic” group of languages of Hebrew and Aramaic. By the 8th century CE, the Arabic language began spreading throughout the MENA, as many people converted to Islam, and were obliged to pray in Arabic. This brings us to the most important constituent in the term “Arab”, ie the Arabic language – not people. To describe everyone who is Muslim or speaks Arabic as Arab is incorrect. Religiosity is not ethnicity and nor are they interchangeable.A lot of what has happened in the MENA is sadly a case of unintended consequences. The struggles in these regions to a great extent has shifted from a nationalist to a religious front, which has led to the interchangeable terms of “Arabs” and “Muslims”. This has been a predominantly western perception, however, and the labelling of “Arabs” as monolithic can only be described as a fear-mongering term to reflect the “war on terror”. Nonetheless, local contribution via geopolitics and strategic convenience cannot be ignored. Hoyland explains that the term “Arab” is a modern 19th century reference used to break away from the Ottoman Empire as well as Turkish nationalism. After that, the term was embedded with the initiation of the Arab League, specifically Saudi Arabia. It served Saudi very well to cast the one noun to describe two regions because ultimately, as the birthplace of Islam and “Arab”, it was convenient and strategic for this perception to continue. The greater the number of people, the bigger the area, the greater the leverage – and a desperate attempt to hold on to the pan-Islamism and pan-Arabism of yesteryear. The term stuck and was later advanced by Gama Abed Al Nasser in 1950s and 60s. But no greater significance did it play until the 1967 war with Israel to give the perception of a big military force – a phantom bigness. Nowadays, the same term is a convenience for hawkish Israelis to refer to the Palestinians, casting them into that otherness, further into a phantasmagorical horror, and to erase their identity from lexicon listings.According to Hoyland, the “Arab” term is becoming less popular in the Middle East, because the movement is seen as “backward”. “Nationalism and Islam has had its day,” he says. Last year, the US Census Bureau held a forum to improve classifications of nationalities, race and ethnicities of the MENA, inviting 40 experts to discuss current data. The outcome of the forum will most likely lead to an increase in the number of classifications of ethnicities, race and nationalities in the MENA. This may get us closer to a more concise representation of the realities, rather than assumptions, and may help us understand the complexities of the regions. In lands of millions of Arabic speakers, not everyone is Ali or Abdullah nor Sunni or Shia. Islam consists of a significant number of branches and sub-branches (26 at last count), as well as non-Muslims.“The question is not really whether it is correct but whether it is useful,” Hoyland says. “It is not correct in the sense that everyone that lives in this region is an Arab or wants to be referred to as Arab.”We need to scrap the free memberships that misplace ethnicity, identity, culture and history. Doing so would not only go some way to preventing exclusion, but also give context, and provide a starting point in promoting understanding. It may even prevent incidents of racism and bias towards anyone or anything that comes from the Middle East and North Africa and happens to speak a dialect of Arabic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bef46c2e8ee79e5c743fa8f95c2a80eeeb8385a4/0_23_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7ace255b428bfa8549f74946b7160919 1240w","title":"should i live london google","story":"Every day millions of people ask Google life’s most difficult questions. Our writers answer some of the commonest queriesAccording to films – yes. But if you move to W11 thinking you’ll nab a cute one-bed on a bookseller’s salary and bump into Julia Roberts, well, think again. The average flat price in Notting Hill is currently £890,000 according to (shudder) Foxtons. Julia Roberts is based in Malibu. And there are just an estimated 112 independent bookshops left in London. I am afraid that, as with a lot of big cities, living in London is a bit like playing roulette. Some win big, some struggle to catch a break. Either way, there is always someone waiting to take your place.Why live in London? Some feel they have to. Mostly this is for work. It goes without saying that for national political careers, one must be London-based, as the Houses of Parliament are situated in Westminster. In the media, all of the big national papers are located in London, as are the majority of broadcasters, and the regional press is struggling. The City of London is the world’s financial capital (there’s an annual arm wrestle in a cocktail bar with Wall Street bankers to maintain the title). Hospitality, tourism and services are all booming. In fact, London’s economy, as it is never tires of boasting, props up the whole of the UK – and grows at twice the national rate. There are signs, however, of shifts. Birmingham is a growing financial hub and Channel 4 has been given a government deadline to move from the capital. The BBC moved a chunk of its production to Salford (Greater Manchester) in 2011. The “northern powerhouse”, who knows, might grow to be an actual thing rather than a line repeated in every speech circa 2015, and the election of the regional “metro” mayors has gone some way towards devolving power. Some things, though, are moving further afield: post-Brexit, the European Medicines Agency moved to Amsterdam. But London is still “where it is at”. For culture vultures, London is a heaven inside a ring-road. There are an estimated 241 theatres and more than 250 registered art galleries and museums. London is the birthplace of punk and grime. For foodies, there are 72 Michelin-starred restaurants in the capital, and thousands of local cafes and establishments that are the gems of their own communities. The Turkish restaurants on Green Lanes are said to be some of the best in Europe. Marie’s Cafe on Lower Marsh is a new genre – Thai greasy spoon. For lovers of scenery, Hampstead Heath offers one of the UK’s most beautiful spaces. The city’s history rises like damp from the underground (the first tube journey took place in 1863) and floats to the surface of the Thames (where, no biggie, woolly mammoths used to quench their thirst).London state schools, once a significant cause for concern, are now among the best in the UK after a transformation effort (noticeably the London Challenge in 2003) that is studied around the world. The Times Higher Education rankings put 20 of the top 93 UK universities in London, which makes London’s 400,000 student population understandable.As for crime, London by many measures is not worse than the rest of the UK. Though a recent surge in knife crime has caught attention, its homicide level is not the highest in the UK for its population size (that would be Greater Manchester) and a lot of people who think of London as a big scary kraken of crime have never lived in London.So, the answer to the question: should you live in London? Well, I apologise for sounding like a life coach but it depends on who you are, and what you want in life. If you are someone who enjoys a leisurely stroll during rush hour and takes a relaxed attitude to escalator etiquette, absolutely not. If you are a burgeoning family already based in London, with a need for a garden and, struggling on a budget of what elsewhere would be a very sizeable sum of money, perhaps. (If, however, you’re the type of parent who enjoys, say, baby raves, then, yeah … stay in London.) If you are an immigrant, consider it: more than 300 languages are spoken, there’s an immigrant population of 3 million already, and our economy needs you, despite what some are saying of late. If you want to be able to see the stars at night and breathe clean air, then no (this is something I have been considering recently, on both an existential and a lung-based level), because London has some of the worst pollution in the UK. If you are a money launderer, hun, you don’t even have to live in London, the city welcomes you with open arms. If you like friendliness in strangers … still live in London, because I don’t agree (and I’m a northerner), with the trope of it being an unfriendly place. Should you live in London if you are homeless and have lived in the city for years and your entire support network is based here, yet your council is trying to move to you to some faraway part of the country? Hell yes, you should live in London. Write to your MP. If you want a transport network that means five minutes for the next train is deemed an annoyingly lengthy wait, also yes. If you don’t enjoy quasi-jaunty pub signs that crush the soul, then no. Or, yes, but know that you shall have to endure them.

Starbucks offers a 25p discount for customers who bring in a reusable mug or tumbler. Its own costs £1.The largest chain, Costa, will take 25p off for any reusable cup for hot and cold barista-served drinks (excluding stores in Northern Ireland and concessions stands in petrol stations). Its own reusable cups cost £3.Pret a Manger\u0026nbspdoubled its discount\u0026nbspto 50p on all hot drinks bought by customers with reusable cups, and it is planning to launch its own reusable cup later in the year.Bakery chain Paul has recently more than doubled its reusable cup discount – from 10p to 25p – for customers ordering any hot drink. Its own reusable mug costs £3.50.Greggs\u0026nbspwill refill any reusable cups and give those customers a 20p discount.​ Its own reusable cups cost £2.Disposable cups cannot be recycled by normal systems because they are made from cardboard with a tightly bonded polyethylene liner, which is difficult to remove. As a result, just one in 400 cups are recycled.From Wednesday, Costa is to pay a supplement of £70 to the waste collectors for every tonne of cups collected, to make it more financially attractive for them to collect, sort and transport coffee cups to recycling plants, meaning fewer cups will end up in landfill. The company says these extra costs will not be reflected in higher prices for consumers.Among potential solutions to the coffee cup problem, MPs on the environmental audit committee recently proposed a 25p “latte levy” on all hot drinks bought in takeaway containers. The coffee chain Starbucks is currently trialling the impact of a 5p levy in a three-month pilot, while Waitrose has announced plans to remove all disposable coffee cups from its shops by this autumn. Costa offers a 25p discount to customers who bring in a reusable cup, while Pret A Manger offers a 50p reduction.Trewin Restorick of the environmental charity Hubbub said of Costa’s move: “It’s great to see industry stepping up the pace to tackle this serious environmental issue. There has been a significant increase in the UK’s recycling facilities over recent months and the biggest challenge now is to make sure the used cups are collected and make it to the recycling plants.”Costa’s announcement is in partnership with five national waste collectors – Veolia, Biffa, Suez, Grundon and First Mile. The move means that the three UK paper mills –James Cropper, ACE UK and DS Smith – that can recycle cups containing polyethylene plastic can potentially boost their recycling from 14m cups to 100m this year.“It dispels the myth that coffee cups can’t be recycled,” said Dominic Paul, managing director of Costa. “By creating a market for cups as a valuable recyclable material, we are confident that we can transform the UK’s ineffective and inconsistent ‘binfrastructure’ to ensure hundreds of millions of cups get recycled every year. 100m cups will be recycled this year alone following our announcement, and if the nation’s other coffee chains sign up, there is no reason why all takeaway cups could not be recycled by as early as 2020.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f08052042d81c045032b3170e575db406668f96c/9_198_2540_1524/master/2540.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=7902c357f39724d2728be32fbb59e431 1240w","title":"barcelona celta vigo la liga match report","story":"Barcelona’s charge towards the title was held up after a much-changed side was held to a 2-2 draw at Celta Vigo, where Sergi Roberto was sent off. They held out to extend their unbeaten run to 40 matches, however, and move 12 points ahead of second-placed Atlético Madrid, who have a game in hand.With one eye on Saturday’s Copa del Rey final against Sevilla, Barça’s manager, Ernesto Valverde, started with both Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez on the bench while Gerard Piqué and Andrés Iniesta were rested.Ousmane Dembélé fired Barça ahead with his first La Liga goal before the defender Jonny Castro Otto equalised on the stroke of half-time.Paulinho put the visitors ahead again just after the hour, by which time Messi had been sent on, but Roberto saw red on 71 minutes for pulling down Iago Aspas, who made it 2-2 with eight minutes left.The Celta substitute Lucas Boye saw a late effort cleared off the line as Barça held out to extend their unbeaten run to 40 matches and move 12 points ahead of second-placed Atlético Madrid, who have a game in hand.Dembélé and Philippe Coutinho came into the Barça team as part of eight changes, with the goalkeeper Marc ter Stegen captaining them for the first time.Celta, who started ninth in the table and still in contention for a Europa League spot, should have taken the lead after 10 minutes when Aspas picked out Maxi Gómez in a central position and his snapshot was beaten away by Ter Stegen.On 25 minutes Paulinho got up to meet a corner and sent a header downwards, the ball bouncing up and on to the left-hand post.Celta then produced a swift counterattack, which found Brais Méndez in space on the right side of the penalty area, but the midfielder could only curl his shot wide.Ter Stegen had to be alert just after the half-hour, making a smart one-handed save to push away a rising shot from Gómez.Barcelona soon broke the deadlock on 36 minutes when Dembélé crashed the ball in from the edge of the area on the half-volley.Celta, though, hit back to equalise just before half-time. André Gomes was caught in possession as Aspas pushed the ball out to Gómez on the right. The low cross flashed through the six-yard box, where the left-back Jonny got ahead of his marker to bundle it in from point-blank range.At the start of the second half the Vigo midfielder Jozabed curled the ball wide after Barcelona had been opened up down the left.On the hour Messi was sent into action, replacing Coutinho, as Valverde looked to inject some fresh life into his team.Barcelona regained the lead after 64 minutes when Paulinho tapped in a low cross from the right by Nélson Semedo.Roberto was shown a red card when he pulled back Aspas as the Vigo captain broke down the left and it was no surprise when the equaliser came, albeit somewhat fortunately.Emre Mor’s cross from the left was punched out by Ter Stegen only for the ball to deflect off Aspas, and into the net, quite possibly off the forward’s arm.Ter Stegen redeemed himself with a smart block as Boye went through late on to help Barça preserve their unbeaten run.Deportivo La Coruña face an uphill task to avoid the drop after being held to a 0-0 draw by Sevilla at Estadio Riazor.Consecutive 3-2 wins in their last two outings had boosted Depor’s survival hopes but they are now four points adrift of 17th-place Levante having played a game more.Carlos Fernández and Guido Pizarro both went close for Sevilla in the first half, although only the latter managed to test the goalkeeper, Rubén.After the interval Deportivo had the better opportunities – with Pedro Mosquera firing over and Emre Colak failing to beat David Soria.Clarence Seedorf’s Deportivo side were trying to win their third match in a row after a run of 15 winless games. Sevilla, who played with several second-string players in readiness for the Copa del Rey final, have not won in seven successive matches in all competitions.Villarreal, meanwhile, ended a three-game winless streak by defeating Leganés 2-1 to open a three-point gap on seventh-place Sevilla. Víctor Ruiz put the home side ahead before half-time and Carlos Bacca added to the lead early in the second half while Darko Brasanac pulled one back for 14th-place Leganés near the end."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1fddd415ae18703545c4d0820a9a883c370eabe/0_41_2133_1280/master/2133.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=69f5733f2ff5a5cbcc04cd6d71ddf8fc 1240w","title":"brighton tottenham premier league match report","story":"It was on this day last year that Brighton ensured their promotion from the Championship. On Tuesday night at the Amex Stadium they took a small step towards retaining their Premier League status for another season.The fiendish nature of their run-in has been well-documented and Chris Hughton’s team must still face the Manchester clubs, Liverpool and Burnley in their final matches. They needed something, anything, to allow them to breathe a little easily after a worrying run of one point from an available 15. This was it.The horror of Saturday’s 3-2 defeat at Crystal Palace was forgotten as Brighton put their bodies on the line to earn precious reward. The roar from the home crowd at the full-time whistle told its own story. Brighton are eight points clear of third-from-bottom Southampton, although they have played a game more.Tottenham have a bigger match round the corner in the shape of Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final against Manchester United and Mauricio Pochettino appeared to have one eye on it with his team selection. He made six changes from Saturday’s home defeat by Manchester City and omitted Davinson Sánchez and Dele Alli from the squad entirely. He gave Toby Alderweireld his first Premier League action since 28 October and the centre-half was not overly extended.However, Pochettino made the point yet again that the league was the priority. The personnel changes, he said, were purely down to fatigue from the City game. “If we win the FA Cup, we are not going to play Champions League,” Pochettino said. “You only do that if you finish in the top four. Today was the most important game.”For Tottenham it felt like points dropped. Pochettino was entitled to say that his team had “dominated” the game in terms of possession and territory but he was also on the money when he lamented a “lack of aggression” in the final third. They were unable to create sufficient clear-cut chances.Harry Kane put Spurs in front with his 26th goal of the Premier League season – his Golden Boot rival, Mohamed Salah of Liverpool, has 30 – but Brighton showed their strength of character with an instant riposte through Pascal Gross’s penalty. Hughton had given him the responsibility after a couple of penalty misses this season by Glenn Murray.Tottenham’s lead over fifth-placed Chelsea could be cut to five points with four matches to play when their London rivals go to Burnley on Thursday. But theirs remains a position of strength. Three of their final four matches are at Wembley – against Watford, Newcastle and Leicester – and the other one is a trip to West Brom.Pochettino’s team sought to impose their pressing game and they sparked danger on a number of occasions when they forced errors from Brighton high up the pitch. Gross was guilty of the stray pass that set in motion the move for Kane’s goal at the beginning of the second half.He put Gaëtan Bong in trouble, the left-back was tackled by Victor Wanyama and, when the ball broke, Son Heung-min tried to run round Lewis Dunk on the byline. Son did not look to have the room but he benefited from the spin of the ball, which remained on the right side of the line, and the alarm bells sounded when Kane swooped. He crashed home from close range.Brighton’s response was impressive. José Izquierdo got away from Serge Aurier inside the box following Murray’s touch and the Tottenham right-back’s attempt to rectify the situation was clumsy. Izquierdo felt the contact and went down. Gross’s penalty was too powerful for Hugo Lloris.The first half had been end-to-end without too many thrills in front of goal. Son, who menaced Bruno, the Brighton right-back and captain, had the clearest chance in the third minute of stoppage-time. Taking a flick from Kane, he eked out a yard of space before shooting for the bottom corner. Mathew Ryan thrust out a hand to save smartly.Set pieces had seemed the likeliest route to the breakthrough. The tension inside the ground was palpable when Christian Eriksen and Kane stood over free-kicks on the edge of the Brighton area on 11 and 44 minutes respectively, but neither could convert. The awards had followed loose passes from Beram Kayal and Anthony Knockaert.At the other end Dunk rose to direct a towering header at goal from Gross’s 19th minute corner and Anthony Knockaert almost applied the decisive touch in front of Lloris. Knockaert was a willing and pacy outlet and he worked Lloris with a deflected shot while Murray could not muster sufficient power in his flick after slick work from Gross. Ryan also had to be alert to tip over a long ranger from Lucas Moura.Tottenham pushed for the winner in the second half, with Pochettino introducing Mousa Dembélé and Erik Lamela, but Brighton’s resolve was fierce. Their support endured a few flutters, not least when Eriksen fizzed in a cross-cum-shot and Shane Duffy erted the ball inches past the far post, while Lamela was denied by Ryan. Hughton’s battlers had done enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bac9ad34ac93f83d339538dac8b59a0e8a911d59/66_27_1416_850/master/1416.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=10d60632ee84b086cb820778803012eb 1240w","title":"everton fans assess sam allardyce abilities manager zero hero","story":"• Respondents asked to mark questions on scale of zero to 10• Manager again barracked in Saturday’s lifeless draw at SwanseaEverton have sent a survey to season-ticket holders and club members asking them to rate Sam Allardyce’s ability to “get the best out of the team” on a scale of zero to 10.The question about the team manager is part of a wide-ranging survey designed to shape the club’s engagement strategy with supporters. A questionnaire has been emailed to members of the fans’ panel seeking opinions on the direction of the club, match-day experience, the team and the senior management at Goodison Park.On Allardyce supporters are asked to rate his performance on the basis of: “I have a high level of trust in the current manager and coaching staff of Everton eg, in making the right decisions to get the best out of the team.” Ratings range from zero – “completely disagree” – to 10 – “completely agree”.The survey also asks fans to rate their trust in Everton players “being loyal and performing at their best” and the club’s leadership in “making the right decisions for the club’s future”. Belief in the direction of the club, whether or not Everton are portrayed fairly by the media and how strongly fans feel connected to the club are additional questions.Everton have endured a dreadful season having embarked on the biggest spending spree in their history last summer and, while the club’s reversal predates Allardyce’s appointment in November, Ronald Koeman’s successor as manager has attracted fierce criticism. Allardyce was again barracked by Evertonians during the 1-1 draw at Swansea City on Saturday and, despite planning for next season and being under contract until 2019, doubt surrounds his position at Goodison.The club sent the same questions to the panel at the end of last season in response to the Premier League reducing the range of questions in their fans’ survey.

Similarly agents are prohibited from having “a material influence” over the affairs of a club.Last summer Wolves confirmed that the club’s owner since July 2016, the Chinese conglomerate Fosun, does own a stake in Mendes’s company, Gestifute. “Fosun have a percentage stake in the Gestifute company headed up by Jorge Mendes,” the club said.Having acquired the stake in Mendes’s agency in January 2016, the Chinese owner “canvassed advice” from Mendes before buying Wolves six months later, the club’s managing director, Laurie Dalrymple, said on Sky TV this week. Since the takeover Mendes has been involved in recruitment as the manager of his longstanding client Nuno Espírito Santo and Portuguese players who have transformed the quality of the Wolves squad.Public disclosures have stated the stake is owned by Shanghai Foyo, a company majority owned by the Fosun chairman, Guo Guangchang. Gestifute and Shanghai Foyo have since January 2016 been involved in a joint agency and marketing venture in Chinese football the launch in Shanghai was attended by Mendes and officials from Benfica and Monaco, where Mendes has been highly influential.The EFL has said it believes the rules have been complied with after Wolves gave undertakings and put “appropriate arrangements in place” following Fosun’s takeover from Steve Morgan in July 2016.Wolves are compiling a further written explanation of Mendes’s position for the EFL, following complaints last month by the Leeds owner, Andrea Radrizzani. He tweeted during Leeds’ 3-0 defeat by Wolves: “Not legal and fair to let one team owned by a fund who has shares in the biggest players’ agency with evident benefits (top European clubs giving players with options to buy) … why the other 23 teams can’t have the same treatment?”Radrizzani followed that with a letter to the FA, EFL and Premier League seeking clarification of Wolves’ relationship with Mendes. He told the BBC that when he was preparing to buy Leeds last year, he sold his shares in an agency, on advice from his lawyer: “I did because obviously there is a conflict of interest and I always pay attention to staying within the rules.”Dalrymple confirmed this week that Mendes “has advised us on players we have taken but equally he has advised us on players we have not continued to take” and that: “There are some players that are connected with him who have come in and done a really good job for us.”Despite that acknowledgment, and widespread reporting that the standout signing from Porto, Rúben Neves, and other Portuguese recruits, are Mendes clients, neither Mendes nor Gestifute is declared as any of the players’ agents on the FA’s record of Wolves’ signings published this month.Neves signed for Wolves for £15.8m in the summer his agent, recorded in the FA’s document based on filings by Wolves, was another Portuguese intermediary, Jorge Pires Serralheiro. The same agent acted for other young Portuguese players signed by Wolves who are commonly cited as Mendes clients: Pedro Gonçalves, Rúben Vinagre and Boubacar Hanne. The midfielder Diogo Jota, 21, who has excelled on loan from Atlético Madrid, was represented by a Spanish agent, Carlos Bucero Gómez, according to the FA’s document.Gestifute appears only once as an agent in the signings Wolves are recorded to have made last summer: another Gestifute director, Andy Quinn, an accountant based in Dublin, is stated to have acted for Wolves when Jota was signed.Those signings followed the acquisitions the previous year of other Portuguese players, including Hélder Costa, Ivan Cavaleiro and João Teixeira, who were represented by a lawyer, Carlos Osório de Castro, or an agent, Valdir Cardoso, understood to do work for Gestifute.A Wolves spokesman said neither Serralheiro nor Bucero was associated with Mendes or Gestifute. The club has consistently played down Mendes’s influence. Dalrymple, despite confirming the signing of players “connected” to Mendes, described him again this week as an adviser and close friend to the chairman, Jeff Shi, who “can use him as a sounding board”.Wolves are “still completely comfortable with their position,” Dalrymple said, and will provide the same information to the Premier League as they have given to the EFL and FA.“We don’t believe, and I don’t believe the authorities believe, that we’ve stepped outside the rules,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/86390fa2d20a3ca7d122e937ae760358800fd533/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4e9bbff51bb9013245bef5b5c622f0c2 1240w","title":"accrington stanley promotion league one","story":"Accrington, the small Lancashire town with a Football League tradition dating back 130 years, is celebrating as never before. Its team, for so long synonymous with underdog ignominy, have secured a first league promotion, more than 50 years after going bust and tumbling into oblivion. Their ascent to League One is the latest ste​p​ in the extraordinary revival of Accrington Stanley, the self-styled “club that wouldn’t die”.Stanley first joined the league in 1921, following in the footsteps of Accrington FC, an inaugural Football League member who lasted for only six years. Their successor survived for longer but found things no easier. Trapped between Burnley and Blackburn, and circled by even bigger fish in Merseyside and Manchester, Stanley faced a constant battle to stay afloat.The club’s only respite from the bottom tier came in 1958, when they were drafted into the new national Division Three. Four years later financial problems forced them out of the league and by 1966 the club had folded. Stanley disappeared for two years before being reborn in the back room of a pub and settling into non-league anonymity.Their name became best known for a mocking reference in a milk advert. “Accrington Stanley, who are they?” may still have its own Wikipedia page but the team that the club president, Peter Marsden, called “the most famous minnows in the world” have now returned emphatically to the map.The stewardship of the long-time manager, John Coleman, and the owner, Andy Holt, who took over in 2015, has allowed the perennial strugglers to broaden their ambitions.The windfall helped Accrington climb into the Conference and secure full-time status, laying the foundations for an unexpected league return in 2006. Their new status brought back old financial concerns, with Coleman conjuring a late run of wins to keep them up in their first season, and the threat of a second bankruptcy was never far away.The team owe their league return and subsequent survival to a string of benefactors with roots in the town, from Whalley and Marsden to the banker Ilyas Khan and former Lancashire and England cricketer David Lloyd, enamoured of his hometown club’s will to “fart against thunder”. Marsden also wanted to turn Stanley’s hard luck story into a motivating source of pride. When he reappointed Coleman and his assistant, Jimmy Bell, in 2014 after a two-year absence, he urged the club to put aside their “misplaced sense of inferiority”.Holt’s investment has bolstered this new self-belief and the owner has become a prominent cheerleader. Last year he pointed out that the club’s £2.2m turnover was less than every current top-flight club spent on agent fees in a single year – in short, Stanley are “a starving peasant begging for scraps” from the Premier League table.The club’s main men have also endured run-ins with the Football League. Coleman spoke out after Carlisle were allowed to move home games in the wake of flooding in 2015, an option he claimed was not available to Accrington. This season Holt’s revelation that he gives the team £200 to spend in McDonald’s after wins has led to ill-advised EFL intervention. The league has since tried to bury the hatchet, presenting Holt with a burger at its annual awards ceremony days before promotion was confirmed.The forward Billy Kee, named in the EFL’s team of the season at last week’s ceremony, truly embodies the Accrington way. Released by Leicester City at the age of 20, Kee was nurtured by Coleman at a time when he wanted to walk away from football. The manager has not forced a nutritional regime on his target man and gave the striker time off to deal with anxiety and depression. He has repaid his manager with more than 50 league goals, including the double that secured promotion against Yeovil on Tuesday.On and off the field Stanley have reaped the benefits of doing things differently. After home wins at the Crown Ground, £1 pints of beer are served up to supporters, and Coleman has built a team worthy of promotion at an equally modest price. Promotion to the third tier for a team once best remembered as a punchline is an incredible achievement but not a shock based on recent results. Stanley missed out by the width of a post in 2016 and have lost once since Boxing Day.Kee, Coleman and even Holt, who has thrown himself into the realities of lower-league football, may need time to adjust to their new surroundings. They will play teams whose grounds could hold most of the town’s 35,000 population, but it would be a mistake to write them off. Theirs is a club that has survived and\u0026nbsp thrived by doing things on their own terms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0bfb3500adf59d247345c3e11d39ff9193dbbe51/0_154_3296_1979/master/3296.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=720ffd530c5b42ce49e6b1763790c7fc 1240w","title":"commonwealth nations malaria summit london","story":"Leaders at health summit in London will be urged to adopt target of halving cases of the disease by 2023, to save 650,000 livesInvestments worth more than £2.7bn are being pledged on Wednesday in a drive to halve the number of malaria cases across the Commonwealth.Heads of state and business leaders are convening in London to galvanise the fight against the disease, which has seen a resurgence in some areas.For the first time in 10 years, malaria cases are no longer falling. Not only has progress stalled but in some countries the trend has reversed. Six out of 10 malaria cases globally occur in Commonwealth countries. The leaders of those nations will be urged to make a historic commitment to halve the number of malaria cases by 2023 – a goal that, if successful, would prevent 350 million cases and save 650,000 lives. The heads of 16 out of 53 Commonwealth countries attend a summit on Wednesday, hosted by the governments of Rwanda, Swaziland and the UK. Rwanda is one of the countries experiencing a rise in malaria cases.Pedro Alonso, director of the World Health Organization global malaria programme, warned that the fight against the disease is at a crossroads. “History has taught us well that when we lift our foot from the accelerator malaria comes back with a vengeance. We must take a decisive leap forward or we risk going backwards and we have seen that already happening in a number of countries,” he told the Guardian.Last year, a report by the WHO found that Rwanda and Nigeria saw more than 1 million new cases of malaria between 2015 and 2016. Twenty-four countries had an increase of more than 50,500 cases in 2016.Just five of the 29 high-burden countries, including Gambia and Madagascar, saw a significant decrease in malaria cases. “We are stalling and unless we do something urgently we are going to see this trend continue in the coming years,” said Alonso. Bill Gates, chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation – which announced it will extend its investments in malaria by an additional £700m through to 2023 – said he hoped the summit would mark a turning point in tackling the disease.“The commitments being made today show the world is ready to beat malaria. It’s a disease that is preventable, treatable and ultimately beatable, but progress against malaria is not inevitable.”The summit will call for greater investment in new ways to combat the disease as the existing methods – nets, sprays and treatments – come under threat from drug and insecticide resistance.Pharma company GSK has pledged £175m in research and development on top of existing funding that includes work to implement the world’s first malaria vaccine, due to be piloted in Ghana, Kenya and Malawi later this year. It is anticipated the company’s new interventions – delivered on a not-for-profit basis – will reach more than 3 million people worldwide.Meanwhile the Global Fund to fight Aids, Tuberculosis and Malaria will announce $2bn of funding from 46 countries affected by malaria between 2018 and 2020.The UK has already pledged £500m a year to tackling the disease until 2020-2021. Of that £100m will be used to fund-match contributions from private donors through the Global Fund. The prime minister, Theresa May, said: “We will support and incentivise others to invest in what is needed, from cutting edge research to ensuring access to malaria treatment and prevention for those most at risk.”Global funding for malaria has plateaued since 2010 and is disproportionately provided by donor countries rather than those with malaria risk.The Ghanian president, Nana Akufo-Addo, said: “We are on a cliff edge. Either we step back and save millions more lives or we fall and see a deadly resurgence that could take half a century to recover from.“This is not a plea for more aid money from western donors. I have publicly committed myself to African leaders finding African solutions to African problems. It is right we take responsibility for our own destiny.”He assured: “Where greater domestic funding is needed we will find the money.”Joy Phumaphi, executive secretary of the African Leaders Malaria Alliance, said the reasons for a resurgence in some countries varied.“The east African countries have had a distinct challenge because of the El Niño phenomenon – they have had flooding every year now for several years. There has also been an increase across all countries in temperature attributed to climate change.” These conditions have led to an increase in mosquito populations, she said. “In Rwanda, they have massively increased their rice production, and rice paddy fields provide ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes.”James Whiting, executive director at Malaria No More UK, said it would be a huge step forward if Commonwealth countries, where about half of all global malaria cases are found, were to meet the 2023 target.“Our hope is that this is the beginning of a tidal wave across the world of reigniting the malaria campaign.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e65f676da3c33daa5ea13a5503b6c2cccf5bc364/0_547_3617_2170/master/3617.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d52132ac0838201978989a0f677b89cb 1240w","title":"held back from promotion too honest","story":"Have you got a work-related problem?

Are cinephiles – and conventional broadcasters – right to fear for the future?At the Berlin film festival last February, Clare Binns took her seat for the premiere of a Spanish film that was generating a quiet buzz. She hoped it might play at Picturehouse Cinemas, the British chain of cinemas she runs. In the film, La Enfermedad del Domingo (Sunday’s Illness), an abandoned daughter confronts her well-to-do mother in a remote mountain village. The film’s director, Ramón Salazar, has a knack for epic melodrama that has drawn comparisons with the work of Pedro Almodóvar.“It was a fantastic film, and one that is made to be seen in cinema,” says Binns. “But it was only when I was sitting there watching it that I noticed the logo.”Alongside the name of the film’s Spanish production company, there rose the ubiquitous – and increasingly isive – mark of Netflix. The streaming giant, which this week announced it has more than 125 million global subscribers, had financed the film. Binns immediately knew this drastically reduced her chances of getting anywhere near it. “We went straight to the producer to try to work out a way – in Spain, they are doing a theatrical release – but Netflix didn’t want to do anything else,” she adds.Instead, Netflix will add La Enfermedad del Domingo to its dizzying carousel of content in June, where users may enjoy it at home. “I don’t object to Netflix as a business,” says Binns, who is a subscriber herself. “But for a film like that to show just on a platform and not the big screen is just so depressing. It’s a disgrace.”Binns’ feelings echo an epic tussle in the global film and TV industries. Last week, a spat between Netflix and the European cinema establishment erupted a month before the Cannes film festival. The company, which declined to answer questions, only occasionally shows its movies in handfuls of cinemas, partly to make them eligible for awards. Even then, the films are made available for home viewing at the same time, a sacrilege in the world of cinema. Now the industry fears for the future of a business model – and an art form.Last week, Ted Sandaros, the chief content officer at Netflix, breezily announced that Netflix would skip Cannes rather than show films out of competition. The festival had “set the tone”, he told Variety. “We are choosing to be about the future of cinema. If Cannes is choosing to be stuck in the history of cinema, that’s fine.”Cultural chasms have opened along the Croisette before, but this time the old guard is facing a rapidly evolving digital beast that can afford to dismiss the most prestigious festival in the business. Sandaros was so relaxed withdrawing that he found time to needle Frémaux. After the festival chief had also banned selfies on the Cannes red carpet (they “tarnish the quality and tempo of the ascending of the steps”), Sandaros wondered “what other advances in media Frémaux would like to address”.But to what extent is Netflix’s tightening grip on our screens irresistible, and how does the company’s culture – built around its sage-like founder and CEO, Reed Hastings – explain its success? Because, apart from the protectionist cries of cinephiles, Netflix is facing a coming onslaught from new- and old-world rivals. Streaming services, such as Amazon, Hulu and Apple, are investing fast, while – perhaps most significantly – Disney is pulling its own content from Netflix before its planned launch of a rival streaming platform late next year.“He is why I wanted to write the book,” Keating says of Hastings. “I had watched him consistently make call after call that nobody on Wall Street thought were good ideas – and he just knew. He just didn’t care when his share price tanked and I’d never seen a CEO like that.” Keating says the data Netflix has amassed – what its viewers like, how long they watch, when they watch – is “everything”. She adds: “They constantly have a finger on the pulse, and the demand curve that they have observed allows them to project into the future in a way that I don’t know anyone in any other industry can do … I just don’t think anybody knew what effect this model would have on how that content is created.”Gareth Neame has watched that transformation during more than 20 years in British television, having worked at both the BBC and independent production companies. He commissioned series including Spooks, State of Play and Hustle. In terms of funding, he says, “one way or another, a producer usually got to about £1m an hour”.The model shifted again when Netflix and others began bulk-buying content to satisfy its subscribers. Producers had yet another revenue stream and they began financing shows in anticipation of a streaming deal, pushing budgets and quality higher still. This increased Netflix’s subscriptions – and its own spending power once it began making its own shows. (The Crown, made for Netflix by the British production company Left Bank Pictures, has a budget of more than £10m an episode.) The centre of gravity has shifted and, for TV and film-makers, Netflix has become an attractive home.In 2015, BBC Two and BBC America showed the first series of The Last Kingdom, a big-budget drama based on Bernard Cornwell’s Saxon Stories. Neame had made it for the BBC, but Netflix came calling and found the show an enthusiastic global audience. “The first season didn’t break through on BBC America, but it did on Netflix in the US,” Neame says. So Netflix replaced BBC America for the second series, co-producing it with the BBC and Carnival. This month, Carnival announced that the third series of The Last Kingdom will be an exclusive production for Netflix. “Their mission seems to be to back storytellers and let them get on with it,” Neame says.For fledgling film-makers, that support can often be the difference between making a film and not. For years, Adam Randall, a British director, struggled to find funding for iBoy, a sci-fi teen thriller adapted from a 2010 young adult novel. By 2015, he and his producer had raised just $600,000. Then Netflix got hold of the script. “We got on the phone in early 2016 and an hour later they were on board,” Randall says. “They raised the budget to roughly $1.5m.”iBoy, released on Netflix in January last year, was the first British Netflix Original film. Had he made it without Netflix, with half the budget, Randall thinks the film, a London-set genre piece for teens, might have struggled to win the interest of distributors or festivals. “To get to a young audience with Netflix was perfect and it has been seen by a much wider international audience than I could ever have hoped for,” he says.Disney’s streaming service, for which it is making Star Wars TV shows, appears to set the studio against Netflix in an epic battle for eyeballs, not least after its planned acquisition of 21st Century Fox. But not every industry observer sees it that way. “The reality is that Amazon, Hulu and even Apple are already further along than Disney,” says Rich Greenfield, a Silicon Valley analyst at San Francisco trading firm BTIG. “I think it’s a highly entrepreneurial culture that’s about a willingness to sacrifice near-term profits to win long-term.” Legacy media companies have neither the stomach nor culture to truly take on that fight, Greenfield believes.Nor do they have Netflix’s data, which will require a big additional investment in old-school marketing for Disney and others. And Netflix is big in that game, too. In January, the company said it would increase its marketing budget to $2bn. This month, it was reported that Netflix is bidding more than $300m for a billboard company in the heart of Hollywood. The reported move, which neither party commented on, appeared to reflect Netflix’s rampant growth strategy – but also the devil-may-care attitude that was evident in Cannes.“If it’s true, it would seem to confirm the idea in Hollywood that Netflix is taking over the world,” Keating says of the billboard ploy. The company’s culture has been an object of speculation for years, fuelled in part by its publication, in 2009, of a “freedom and responsibility” slide show for would-be employees (in January, the company had 5,500 employees globally). Last year, it updated and shortened the document, setting itself apart from the Silicon Valley archetype of free lunches and ping-pong tables with a tougher, more grownup atmosphere. Managers frequently judge teams against a “keeper test” if Jim, say, were planning to leave, would you fight to keep him? If not, employees are “promptly and respectfully given a generous severance package”. “They describe themselves as being like a pro sports team,” Keating adds.Several former Netflix employees declined to contribute to this article. But where will Netflix’s win-at-all-costs mentality take it – and audiences? Hastings himself has committed only to doing more of the same, but many watchers see an eventual route into live TV, news and sports broadcasting as streaming services continue to grind down old broadcasters and channels. Netflix and other streaming services will become TV as we know it. “I also think we’ll see more experimentation with virtual reality and user-generated plot twists,” Keating says, pointing out the advantages a tech-first company would have in doing so.In the meantime, Netflix has work to do if it wants to make friends in the industries it is shaking up. The company’s logo may not be featuring at Cannes next month, but its executives will be there, buying yet more content. “I think everyone is frightened about the new world order,” says Binns at Picturehouse Cinemas, who will also be at the festival. “I just hope people start to recognise that we need to be talking to each other and working out a way of making sure we’re not killing the cinema.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b366e2e9b3442cd6953687c11d976405cb01fbb5/78_7_1046_628/master/1046.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=e2f44b0da0a3c0e433741525396a2983 1240w","title":"snail ballet dancers slow pixel elizabeth saint jalmes cyril leclerc","story":"Raised to be sauteed in garlic butter but freed by French vegetarian art anarchists, meet the unlikely stars of a mindful music performance Only minutes after meeting Elizabeth Saint-Jalmes and Cyril Leclerc at their Paris apartment, I’m invited into their darkened boudoir. Several snails are crawling on the floor next to the bed. Each has a little light-emitting diode attached to its shell that activates sensors on a nearby speaker designed by Elizabeth that is pumping out soothingly drone-like music composed by Cyril.What I’m witnessing is a teaser for a six-hour, 176-snail ballet called Slow Pixel that the two artists are bringing to London later this month for its UK premiere as part of Cryptic’s Sonica festival. For only £4.50, you can watch illuminated snails crawl around a darkened room to challenging music. Don’t tell me you’re not tempted.“These snails were raised to be eaten,” Elizabeth whispers. It’s striking how all three of us change our behaviour in this chambre des escargots – we speak more quietly, walk gingerly around the room (none of us want to hear the crunch of calcium carbonate shell) and find ourselves kneeling to get a closer view. We, as much as the snails, are performers in this ballet.Can you assure me, I whisper, that no gastropods were harmed in the making of this artwork? “Absolutely,” replies Elizabeth, thoughtfully placing one on my notebook, the better to illuminate my shorthand.She tells me that these eight snails, and the hundreds more she and Cyril keep in the cellar, are from the gastronomically prized species gros-gris (fat greys). “We are vegetarians and in a sense we have freed them from their destiny.” That destiny, most likely, was to be sauteed in garlic butter.Cyril produces a plant mister and sprays the snails with water. “They like humidity and showering them helps simulate that,” he says. Don’t the snails get stressed with diodes strapped to their shells? “Snails don’t get stressed,” he says. “Their heart rate is always 35 beats per minute. You know when they’re upset, though. They retreat into their shells.”Cyril, 43, and Elizabeth, 40, have been using snails in their art for eight years. Their first gastropod-based interventions involved feeding snails paper of different colours. Cyril recalls: “We would feed them red paper and they would shit red patterns. And if we fed them yellow and blue paper, what colour do you think they would shit?” Green? “Exactly.”The French couple’s art has an appealingly daffy, anti-commercial tenor. To clinch the point, Elizabeth takes a hunting horn from its case and blows a few notes so loud as to give any urban foxes in the 20th arrondissement the willies. Not to be outdone, Cyril starts strumming his tampura, an Indian stringed instrument often used to create droning, meditative effects. As I sit on the sofa drinking Japanese tea and snacking on cheese and nuts while they blow and strum, I wonder what the neighbours think.“We’re very much influenced by Fluxus,” says Elizabeth. That group of 60s artists, musicians, performers and even chefs often created art happenings involving chance, factors that provoked interactions between artist and audience. Elizabeth and Cyril’s work is neo-Fluxus, combining music, choreography and drawing, plus free-roaming snails.They hope to seduce visitors into a new relation with space and time. In a world where, as Parisian philosopher Paul Virilio has argued, technological change destroys space and compresses time, what a beguiling existential corrective it is to slow to a snail’s pace for a few hours. “Remember when you were a kid and you could sit and look at an insect for hours? Or watch a snail crawl across a path?” asks Elizabeth. Cyril hopes it will give visitors a Proustian rush, provoking bittersweet meditation on impermanence and lost time.During the performance, Elizabeth and Cyril place the light-bearing snails on the walls, creating effects that simulate the night sky or city lights. While the snails crawl up and down, the artists project video footage behind them shot from the window of the Trans-Siberian Express – as if to emphasise the difference between the human and gastropod pace of life. “What we both found amazing was how on the train, which actually only goes at about 80kmh, you can do nothing but eat, sleep and read – so your mind and body are in a different temporal relation to the world,” says Elizabeth. “That inspired much of what we’re thinking about with Slow Pixel.”Do many visitors stay for six hours? “It varies – some stay for just a few minutes,” says Elizabeth. “We insist only on one thing – people leave their phones outside.” They’ve both noticed how some visitors will try to smuggle their phones into the performance space, furtively taking selfies with snails.“It’s a shame when they do that, because we’re hoping to encourage mindfulness,” says Cyril. “Be in the moment, not always photographing it.” Such mindful art is a growing cultural tendency, embracing things from colouring books, to Rolf Hind’s opera Lost in Thought, to the TV shows that court viewers who want to get a real-time reindeer’s eye view of crossing the Arctic. “These can be immersive experiences for iniduals, liberating them from the everyday world,” says Elizabeth. “Just for a few hours.” Minutes later when I’m strap-hanging on the Métro, hurrying to catch the Eurostar home to meet a deadline, I realise these two French artists are right: us heedless humans have much to learn from the wisdom of snails.

Almost none of the staff there knew anything about political campaigning. A lot of what I said to them and what I presented to them was novel. They had never heard of any of these tactics. They had never participated in politics before, and openly said: ‘I work for an insurance company, so: help.’”Kaiser said she and a Cambridge Analytica colleague gave advice on how to improve the survey methodology. “I was under the impression, by what they told me, that every single inidual that they were pulling up to call was actually a lead or a current customer of Eldon Insurance or Go Skippy.”She added: “They had probably already been doing that around a month or two.”The disclosure raises further questions about comments made by Andy Wigmore, Leave.EU’s former communications director, in which he described how the campaign used insurance actuaries to identify prime locations for political campaigning.Wigmore told the Guardian that no actuaries had been employed by the campaign. Kaiser also told the committee that Banks set up a company called Big Data Dolphins, which she said was working with a data science team at the University of Mississippi, after he ceased negotiations with Cambridge Analytica. Kaiser questioned whether the data of British citizens “was sent abroad, specifically to Mississippi” for processing by Big Data Dolphins.Leave.EU attacked Kaiser’s evidence as “a confused litany of lies and allegations” and said that Eldon Insurance did not share data with anyone. “No data has been sent to Mississippi. The unit is still in the planning stage, it employs no one and is not operational,” the group said.An invoice of the same value was issued to Ukip, and Banks told the Observer that he had made a donation to the party to cover the cost of the bill. However, Ukip said it never paid Cambridge Analytica. It is unclear whether the invoice was ever settled.Kaiser also told the committee she had seen documents in which Nigel Oakes, the co-founder of the SCL Group, and the head of its defence ision, revealed the company’s audience-targeting methodology was for several years “export-controlled by the British government”.“That would mean that the methodology was considered a weapon,” she said. “Weapons-grade communications tactics – which means we had to tell the British government if that was going to be deployed in another country outside the United Kingdom.” She said the designation from the UK government was removed in 2015.Among the documents provided to the committee by Kaiser is a legal opinion drafted in support of a proposal for Ukip to share data with Cambridge Analytica.One of the authors of that opinion, Philip Coppel QC, last month represented Cambridge Analytica in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) from obtaining a warrant to raid the company’s premises.Kaiser’s testimony also threatens to raise further questions for Facebook after she said that far more people than previously understood may have had their data harvested from the site.Lawyers for Alexander Nix, the chief executive of Cambridge Analytica who was suspended from his position last month, told the committee that he would not appear because he was a subject in an active ICO investigation.The information commissioner said: “We have written to Mr Nix to invite him to be interviewed by our investigators. Our investigation is looking at whether criminal and civil offences have been committed under the Data Protection Act.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/290ee002335d943582e276d700a55b18a62358f2/0_0_946_710/master/946.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=f0a890792bf28af627ff748ac6a49d2d 1240w","title":"diamonds in sudan meteorite are remnants of lost planet","story":"Scientists say rock fragments that hit the Earth in 2008 contain evidence of a lost planet that was part of the early solar systemDiamonds found in a meteorite that exploded over the Nubian desert in Sudan a decade ago were formed deep inside a “lost planet” that once circled the sun in the early solar system, scientists say.Microscopic analyses of the meteorite’s tiny diamonds revealed they contain compounds that are produced under intense pressure, suggesting the diamonds formed far beneath the surface of a planet. In this case, the mysterious world was calculated to be somewhere between Mercury and Mars in size.Astronomers have long hypothesised that dozens of fledgling planets, ranging in size from the moon to Mars, formed in the first 10m years of the solar system and were broken apart and repackaged in violent collisions that ultimately created the terrestrial planets that orbit the sun today.If the latest findings are confirmed, the Almahata Sitta meteorite will be the only known remnants of one of these long-lost planets. The material will give scientists a unique window into the cosmic conditions that prevailed in the deep history of the solar system.“Simulations have suggested that the early solar system had tens of these embryonic planets that collided with each other to form the terrestrial planets, but having evidence of one of them? I wasn’t expecting that,” said Farhang Nabiei, who studied pieces of the meteorite at the Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland.Philippe Gillet, a senior author on the study, said: “We are doing archaeology, looking into the past, and trying to decipher the story of the solar system.”The Almahata Sitta meteorite was the first to be tracked by telescopes as it sped towards Earth and exploded over the Nubian desert in 2008. The event prompted a recovery effort by the University of Khartoum, which gathered 480 pieces of the meteorite amounting to 4kg of battered material.Early inspections of the meteorite revealed it to be a ureilite, an unusual composition that does not match other space rocks known to have come from the moon or Mars. The finding led some scientists to speculate that it may have had a more exotic origin.That suspicion grew when researchers noticed little diamonds in the meteorite material. While other meteorites are known to contain diamond crystals, they are generally far smaller. Typical meteorite diamonds are only a few millionths of a millimetre across and are thought to form in collisions with other space rocks that send brief but intense shockwaves through the carbon-rich asteroids.Writing in the journal Nature Communications, the Swiss team now describe fresh analyses that show that diamonds in the meteorite contain specks of an iron-sulphur compound that is thought only to form at pressures greater than 20 gigapascals. They conclude that the diamonds formed with the specks inside them, deep beneath the surface of an unknown world.“We are probably looking at an object that was one of the first planets to circle the sun before they collided with each other to create the actual planets we have today,” said Gillet. James Wittke, who runs the meteorite laboratory at Northern Arizona University, said the scientists’ conclusions were reasonable. “We think that there were probably many larger ‘parent’ bodies in the early solar system, which have since been destroyed, so a since-destroyed body the size of Mercury is reasonable,” he said. “One as large as Mars seems a little surprising, but this paper presents the best, and perhaps only, type of evidence for determining the sizes of these parent bodies.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3416205e560e4a854745ce6d9549edfac5515bb/0_0_5419_3254/master/5419.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=029a9031f19f9cfc3eb7debc8a075c35 1240w","title":"disabled people struggle to afford food and heating study says","story":"Charity says quarter of disabled adults have less than £50 a week left after tax and housing costsDisabled people are being forced to skip meals and sit in cold homes in a climate of benefit and social care cuts, according to new research.Analysis by ComRes on behalf of the Leonard Cheshire Disability charity shows almost a quarter of disabled adults aged 18-65 in the UK missed at least one meal in the last year, while a fifth said they were not able to keep their home warm.Leonard Cheshire said their latest research shows the impact has been “catastrophic” with essential heating, food or travel often becoming unaffordable.Neil Heslop, the CEO of Leonard Cheshire, said: “Our research lays bare the appalling situation many disabled iniduals and families find themselves in.

The site will house a health club and have conference facilities. The aim is to have it built before the start of the 2019-20 rugby and football seasons.Tuesday’s vote on funding was not overwhelming – 69-41 with eight abstentions – reflecting an issue that has ided opinion in the county. Those who opposed the plan questioned not only the significant investment of public money but whether the stadium would prove a drain on resources. “I am relieved and elated,” said Paul Durkin, the chairman of Cornish Pirates. “It has been a long haul but we got our message across that this was a stadium for Cornwall, not just the partners. Councillors have voted to make life better for the next generation and give them opportunities some people have not had so far.”The council was approached at the start of the year after the partners found themselves £6m short of the money needed to finance the stadium. A local MP, Derek Thomas, is meeting government officials on Wednesday to persuade them to honour Cameron’s promise. “We met with secretaries of state and ministers after David Cameron’s commitment, but we did not have a firm proposal then,” said Thomas. “We do now and I have been doing a lot of to-ing and fro-ing between MPs and various groups in relation to this. The council’s decision makes it much easier for us to make the case for government funding to make up the shortfall.”Bristol’s plan to rebrand the club to mark their return to the Premiership, meanwhile, led to them being them mocked on social media. As part of a bid to attract a global audience the team will be known as Bristol Bears. But fans who clicked on the Bristol Bears website after hearing the news were directed to a page run by a gay club in the city, the Bristol Bear, based in Old Market.“It’s hilarious,” said one member. “I have been checking out the rugby website and I am sure the players will be welcomed in Old Market.” Bristol said they were aware of the Bristol Bear club before the rebranding and anticipated a happy co-existence."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7aec6ad21bde100b45bf8149dafcab2ca5106432/0_164_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=14be4c2a7c178b598383e900595c61fa 1240w","title":"mo farah london marathon","story":"Mo Farah believes he can compete with the very best during Sunday’s London Marathon despite failing to deliver during his first attempt at 26.2\u0026nbspmiles in 2014.The 35-year-old dramatically hit the wall in London four years ago, gritting his teeth as early as the 17-mile marker before finishing eighth in a modest 2hr 8min 21sec.This time, however, Farah intends to stay with a stellar field, even if they start at world record pace, and says he is targeting Steve Jones’s 33-year-old British record of 2:07:13, as well as Sondre Nordstad Moen’s European best of 2:05:48.“This is the biggest race,” said Farah. “And there is only one way to run it – mixing with the guys and seeing what I can do. But it’s an amazing field. It’s got Eliud Kipchoge, who has run two hours, Kenenisa Bekele, who has run 2:03 and Daniel Wanjuri, who won last year.”Farah, who has spent the past three months in Ethiopia, says he feels revitalised and relaxed under his new coach, Gary Lough, and, surprisingly, believes he has the ability to run 2:03 – not far off the world record of 2:02:57 – once he has adapted to the uniquely punishing demands of the marathon.“I think I am capable of running 2:04 or 2:03 in the right race with the right pace,” he added. “But Sunday’s race is going to be different. There are many, many guys who are there to fight, so it’s going to be a difficult race.”When asked whether he would be prepared to go at world record pace on Sunday, despite the high temperatures forecast, he nodded. “If that is what the guys are doing, why not?”Certainly Farah appeared more relaxed than last year where barely a press conference went by without him having to fend off questions about his former coach Alberto Salazar, who is still under investigation by the US Anti-Doping Agency.Farah still faced them – insisting that he had not spoken directly to Salazar about running London or to the Nike Oregon Project coach David McHenry since last October – but no longer did he appear burdened by the association or the pressure of having to deliver gold medals over 5,000m and 10,000m.“On the track people expect you to win but now there are a lot of guys who can run a lot faster than me,” he said. “It’s a good feeling. I have found a new challenge and this is something I always wanted to do.”Farah explained that much of his confidence came from working with Lough, who had focused on his weaknesses and freshened up his training by running intervals with shorter rest periods. “There are things he has given me that I have not done before, so I am getting better at getting stronger,” said Farah. “Gary is a genius and I believe in him.”Organisers say they are monitoring the weather forecast – temperatures are projected to be 21C on Sunday – with the race director, Hugh Brasher, warning amateur runners they need to “listen to their body” and “change their plan” because of the heat.It is understood that extra water will be provided and over 1,000 medical staff will be on hand. But Farah insists he is not worried about running in the heat, despite seeing his fellow British athlete Callum Hawkins collapse during the final stages of the Commonwealth Games marathon.“I was obviously devastated seeing that,” said Farah. “Callum is a great fighter – he will go as hard as he can, and try and break the guys. But Sunday will be completely different. Hugh has told us there will be enough staff and doctors on hand.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be8a06f024731935ae550a4239184fc10a9ab29c/91_0_2684_1611/master/2684.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bf4935b22e2060efce3e3af79b9feb25 1240w","title":"runaway 32 year old princess brought back to dubai","story":"Sheikha Latifa, daughter of ruler Sheikh Mohammed, had used YouTube to tell of plan to fleeA Dubai princess who announced in a video that she was fleeing the emirate has been “brought back”, a source close to the Dubai government has said.“What I can confirm is they took her and she was brought back,” the source said on condition of anonymity.The source said he did not know where the royal, 32-year-old Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum – was tracked down or by whom, only that she was now “with her family” and “doing excellent”.Sheikha Latifa, a daughter of Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, appeared in a YouTube video in March announcing she was about to flee.“I’m making this video because it could be the last video I make,” she began.Dressed simply in a T-shirt with her hair pulled back and sitting by a curtained window, the young woman appeared to be filming the video herself.She said she was the daughter of the Dubai ruler and an Algerian mother, Horriya Ahmed, and that she had tried to escape in years past, before she had access to the internet.She said her leaving was “the start of me claiming my life, my freedom”.Over the past month Latifa’s cause has been taken up by a UK-based group called Detained in Dubai, which claims to assist victims of injustice across the United Arab Emirates.The group said the young woman attempted to flee Dubai by ship, but the vessel was intercepted on 4 March, less than 50 miles (80km) off the coast of India.Detained in Dubai has since launched a campaign on her behalf.The source said it was a “private matter” that had been “exploited”, accusing rival Qatar of fuelling the campaign.“It is a domestic issue that transformed into a soap opera that transformed into a rampaging scheme to tarnish the reputation of Dubai and Sheikh Mohammed,” the source said.He said Latifa’s three main companions who participated in the escape attempt – a Finnish woman and two French men, one with dual US citizenship – were wanted in Dubai on previous charges."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b3331b1c6414759bab707ad4105baee5a4a60e6/44_212_3382_2029/master/3382.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=2f33a305e2ec719271e4a6e08f13a906 1240w","title":"talksport outbids bbc to secure rights for forthcoming england cricket tours","story":"TalkSport has announced a major coup late Tuesday after outbidding the BBC to secure the free-to-air radio broadcast rights for England’s forthcoming tours of Sri Lanka and the West Indies.It ends a 13-year association for the BBC, who last lost the rights to an oversees national team cricket tour in 2005, also on that occasion to TalkSport.Scott Taunton, chief exe of Wireless Group Limited, the parent company for TalkSport, was bullish in announcing the changes, as he spoke to Radio Today.“Winning these prestigious rights is a great victory for TalkSport and its first-class coverage.

Given that there has already been a bestselling memoir called I, Tina, a popular biopic starring Angela Bassett and even a jukebox musical, Soul Sister, the claim looks a little exaggerated. But this version, which comes with its subject’s blessing, offers a heady celebration of triumph over adversity and boasts a whirlwind performance by Adrienne Warren that left the audience, though not the star herself, breathless. The book by Katori Hall, assisted by Frank Ketelaar and Kees Prins, dwells on Tina Turner’s extraordinary tenacity and ability to overcome life’s obstacles. Born Anna Mae Bullock in Nutbush, Tennessee, and loving singing in Baptist choirs, she learns to cope with her parents’ separation. Teamed professionally with Ike Turner, whom she eventually marries, she has to endure the horrors of serial abuse. Divorced and striking out on her own, she initially pays a heavy financial price and, as a 40-year-old woman of colour, suffers rejection by a record industry dominated by white men. As the world knows, however, she went on to achieve solo stardom.While recording Tina’s troubles, the show is anything but a sob story since it is a tribute to her gutsiness and drive. I’d have liked to have heard more about how her Baptist upbringing and Buddhist conversion sustained her during the dark times, but Tina’s travails are always offset by the glories of the music. What is striking is the way the songs – and there are 23 of them – are used in a variety of ways. Sometimes they are there to advance the narrative, as when Tina steps into the breach in the recording studio and rescues a session by singing A Fool in Love. At other times, they demonstrate her capacity for reinvention: in River Deep, Mountain High she follows Phil Spector’s injunction to stick to the melody rather than relying on the kind of aggressive fervour encouraged by Ike. Only once did I sense a clunking cue for a song when Tina, talking to a sympathetic marketing man, superfluously enquires “what’s love got to do with it?” But the show rests on the shoulders of Warren, who is rarely off stage and who is simply astonishing. Above all, she captures the fact there is not one Tina Turner but several. Warren shows how Tina develops and changes as a singer and how, in moving to rock stardom, she retains her ferocious energy while introducing occasional notes of plangent melancholy. Warren also conveys Tina’s growth from stoical victim of Ike’s cruelty into a woman of defiant confidence. On top all that, she dances up a storm in a way that had the audience on its feet even before the curtain call. The tricky role is that of Ike, and Kobna Holdbrook-Smith skilfully counters his monstrosity by suggesting that he never got his due as a pre-Elvis rock’n’roll pioneer and that he was a product of a culture that encouraged male swagger: you don’t like Ike but you begin to understand him. That, however, is the mark of a production by Phyllida Lloyd that is both intelligent and consistently good to look at. Mark Thompson’s design uses projections to create a whirling panorama of America, Bruno Poet’s lighting evokes the empurpled skies of Tennessee and the softer registers of a Monet-like Thames and, not least, there is the choreography of Anthony van Laast, which ensures the show is in perpetual motion. As bio-musicals go, this is as good as it gets."},{"url":null,"title":"virtual reality by the guardian","story":"Experience a whole new world of Guardian journalism in two simple steps.  1.

And in a lengthy interview with ABC on Sunday night, the former director of the FBI said Donald Trump was morally unfit to be president. But his high-profile commentary has upset former colleagues who had held him in high regard both personally and professionally.“It’s tasteless at best. There is a total lack of dignity. He, and a number of other FBI employees who worked directly for him, have damaged the agency,” Nancy Savage, executive director of the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI, said of Comey’s book and interview.Savage, who was an agent for 30 years and was president of the FBI special agents association while serving, before she retired in 2011, told the Guardian it was highly inappropriate for Comey to talk about matters relating to the president that are currently under investigation.In his interview with ABC on Sunday, Comey discussed topics such as whether Trump may have obstructed justice by pressing him, while he was still FBI director, to drop his inquiry into the former national security adviser Michael Flynn’s links to Russia. Comey repeated his assertion that Trump asked him for his loyalty, and he aired unconfirmed allegations that Russia has compromising personal material on the president.These issues are among those under investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller and two Senate committees.She also criticized some Comey colleagues such as Andrew McCabe, who was fired  last month over accusations of leaking to the press.Serving agents generally shy away from speaking publicly about FBI matters or politics but there has been plenty of talk behind the scenes. Savage and other former agents said they had heard from FBI staff in the hours since Comey’s interview on ABC aired, and they were not happy.Former senior agent Bobby Chacon said: “The majority of people I have spoken to since Sunday night think it’s unfortunate timing. They are rolling their eyes it’s not good.”Chacon retired in 2014 as head of the FBI underwater forensic e team based in Los Angeles, after being an agent for 27 years. He said there were “still plenty of people” in the agency who supported Comey but many were upset at him “standing on a soapbox”.Chacon is also concerned that Comey, by talking about issues involving Russia and the Trump administration and election campaign, is opening himself up to a tough cross examination if he appears as a witness in any criminal proceedings arising from the investigations.“Comey knows these things, so he may have made the judgment that he’s being careful, but he is playing a dangerous game,” said Chacon, adding: “I worked for him. He did a lot of good things at the FBI. He was popular and I didn’t like the way the White House sacked him ... but he made mistakes and now has been overtaken by his emotions. I’m surprised he has been dragged down into street-fighting with Trump.”Ron Hosko, former assistant director of the FBI’s criminal ision, said he thought Comey had been out of the FBI for long enough that his public comments were less likely to compromise the work of Mueller or Congress. But he said that he believed, and had heard from serving agents, that Comey’s speaking out was only fuel to Trump’s criticism of the agency.“I’m very confident that Robert Mueller knows how to conduct his investigation. But by talking like this Comey is not helping the FBI’s ability to fight back against the attacks on its reputation that have been coming from Trump,” he said. He said it would exacerbate the rift between Trump and the FBI.“I expect these wounds to remain open for a very long time,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f55aa66d310fe1f700e1bc1d369dcebc2ac94c66/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=09be879acff568d017f3ec72b17a68e3 1240w","title":"a political volcano just erupted is the us on the brink of the next watergate","story":"As Trump threatens to fire Mueller, a journalist who was reporting during Nixon’s Saturday Night Massacre reads the warning signsEver since the Watergate scandal of the 1970s, the golden rule for presidents under investigation by a special prosecutor or special counsel has been that the president shall not fire the person conducting the investigation. For there – as medieval maps sometimes warned travelers – “be dragons”.Donald Trump has been lectured repeatedly on this score by various advisers and pundits. Yet word keeps leaking out of the White House that Trump would like nothing more than to fire Robert Mueller. So far, Trump has heeded the warnings. But how much longer, one wonders, can a man who famously bragged that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and get away with it be expected to resist temptation to dismiss the special counsel?Since May 2017, Mueller, dogged as Inspector Javert in Les Misérables, has been investigating assorted misdeeds allegedly committed by Trump and his aides – from “collusion” with Russians meddling in the 2016 presidential election to the payment of large sums of hush money to a porn actor and a former Playboy model. Mueller has already either indicted or wrung guilty pleas from 19 people, including Trump’s former campaign chair. What’s more, it appears that Mueller is following a trail left by former FBI director James Comey, whom Trump did fire last year, on a possible obstruction of justice charge against the president.Clearly, Trump is feeling pinched and would like the cause of his pain to vanish. So let us review the short history of that golden rule everyone keeps warning him about.The investigation into Trump and his team appears to encompass allegations of\u0026nbspcollusion,\u0026nbspobstruction of justice,\u0026nbspabuse of power\u0026nbspand charges specific to\u0026nbspTrump aides and former aides.Any case along these lines against the president would be historic. Both of the presidents to face impeachment proceedings in the past century, Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon, faced obstruction of justice and abuse of power charges.It\u0027s important to note that the work of the\u0026nbspspecial counsel\u0026nbspis secret, and the public has no way of knowing for certain what charges prosecutors may be weighing against the Trump team or,\u0026nbspin what would be an extraordinary development,\u0026nbspagainst the president himself.Mueller\u0026nbspis authorized to investigate any links andor coordination between the Russian government and iniduals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump and related matters. In other words, potential collusion during the 2016 election.But so-called “collusion” is only part of it. The\u0026nbspspecial counsel\u0026nbsphas the broad authority to build a prosecution wherever the inquiry may lead. The investigation has already resulted in charges against former Trump aides such as tax fraud that do not relate directly to election activity.In the course of the investigation,\u0026nbspTrump\u0027s past business practices\u0026nbsphave also\u0026nbspcome under scrutiny. With his first indictments of people in Trump\u0027s orbit, the special counsel has demonstrated an appetite for the prosecution of\u0026nbspalleged white-collar crimes.\u0026nbspThe president has denied all wrongdoing.On Friday, 19 October 1973, Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox issued a subpoena for copies of tape recordings made by Richard Nixon in the Oval Office. With that, Nixon decided he’d had just about enough of Cox, an upright and highly respected attorney and Harvard law professor.The very next day, Nixon ordered his attorney general, Elliot Richardson, who had appointed Cox the previous May, to fire him immediately. Richardson refused and resigned. His successor in the justice department’s chain of command, the deputy attorney general, William Ruckelshaus, likewise refused and resigned. Next up was the solicitor general (and acting attorney general), Robert Bork, who obeyed the president’s order, fired Cox and kept his job. The White House announced the firing – soon dubbed “the Saturday Night Massacre” – at 8.35pm that same night.As a member of Time magazine’s Watergate reporting team, I well remember that night 45 years ago. Normally, by 8.30pm on a Saturday night, the magazine was entering the final stages of its weekly production cycle. But on this Saturday night, Time’s Washington bureau was in all-out crisis mode – correspondents, including me, were frantically phoning sources in Congress, in the White House, in the justice department, at the FBI and anywhere else imaginable, trying to learn what precisely had happened and why and what the ramifications were. Until the previous December, I had been on a three-year assignment, covering the Vietnam war. So I was not unfamiliar with what it felt like to report under pressure. But this situation was something completely new to me. We all understood that a political volcano had just erupted, and I think many of us sensed that the US was on the brink of being changed forever. Not since the civil war had an American president seemed so close to impeachment and never before had the list of impeachable “high crimes and misdemeanors” against a sitting president been so lengthy. The words “constitutional crisis” were on just about everyone’s lips as the full impact of the Cox firing began to be felt during those hectic hours of crash reporting, writing and filing by telex and phone that were necessary in order for us to get the news into the magazine that would be in mailboxes and on the stands 48 to 72 hours later.Soon, Congress also swung into action. At least 22 impeachment resolutions were quickly introduced in the House, along with 12 bills and resolutions, sponsored by 94 Democrats and four Republicans, calling for the appointment of a new special prosecutor. So ferocious was the public and official outcry that within 12 days, a new special prosecutor, Leon Jaworski, was indeed appointed, and would win access to the Nixon tapes before the supreme court. In the meantime, the Senate select committee on Watergate continued its televised hearings, uncovering layer on layer of criminal and unconstitutional behavior.Eventually, the tapes obtained by Jaworski provided the “smoking gun” of Nixon’s involvement in the Watergate cover-up, which in turn led the House judiciary committee to approve three articles of impeachment on bipartisan votes, and forced Nixon’s resignation in disgrace less than a year after the Saturday Night Massacre.As for me, I knew Nixon was doomed politically when, just a week after the massacre, I received a letter from Irene Cloud, my aunt who lived in the tiny town of Kingman, Kansas, some 50 miles or so west of Wichita. Cloud was a dedicated Lincoln Republican in the moderate, anti-slavery Kansas tradition that had existed from the civil war to the 21st century, when the far right captured the state house. An unmarried grammar school teacher, Cloud wrote me rarely but always to a purpose. When I opened the envelope, I found inside a light blue sheet of note paper on which in her perfect, schoolmarm’s hand, she had written “Dear Stanley, I have reached the conclusion that Mr Nixon is a bad man …”If Nixon had lost my Aunt Irene, he had lost the nation.Not everyone today believes that Donald Trump will necessarily suffer the same fate as Nixon should he fire Robert Mueller. At least two good friends of mine who are experts in measuring public opinion – and who are not themselves conservatives – told me recently that they believe Trump’s “base” in the Republican party will stick with him in a way that Nixon’s base, including my Aunt Irene, did not. “They would think firing Mueller was just another example of Trump bringing Washington to heel,” said one.Perhaps so. But there are still dragons out there.Stanley Cloud was part of Time magazine’s Watergate team, and went on to become Time’s Washington DC bureau chief"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de03e30848280398bb5db0a62a717679b709f0b5/0_184_4356_2614/master/4356.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=1f4d0464fe2fa8ca33b7cee30e84d40b 1240w","title":"us syria arab force replace american troops saudi arabia egypt uae","story":"Problematic proposal is backed by national security adviser John Bolton but could worsen conflictThe Trump administration is renewing an effort to replace US troops in Syria with an Arab force, but the proposal faces substantial obstacles and could potentially exacerbate the conflict.The Saudi foreign minister, Adel al-Jubeir, said his government was talking to Washington about raising such a force, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal that said the new US national security adviser, John Bolton, had called the Egyptian intelligence chief, Abbas Kamel, to ask Cairo to play a part in building one.There are about 2,000 US troops in Syria fighting Islamic State, but Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed a desire to withdraw them.The idea of an Arab coalition force playing a role in Syria to combat extremist groups and contain Iranian influence has surfaced several times since 2015, but faces severe problems. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are bogged down in a brutal war in Yemen, and have little manpower and few military resources to spare. They are also locked in a dispute with Qatar, another potential contributor to a force, while Egypt is much closer to the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria than its would-be Gulf partners. Middle East experts said it was feasible Arab states could fund an army run by private contractors and possibly help recruit soldiers from developing countries such as Sudan. Erik Prince, a Trump ally who founded the military contractor Blackwater USA and now advises the UAE, is lobbying to play a role, according to the Wall Street Journal. A similar offer he made last year to replace US troops with private contractors in Afghanistan was turned down by the Pentagon.But Prince may have more traction in the White House over Syria. Bolton has argued that the US has borne too much of the military burden in Syria and Arab states should supply troops and material assistance in the fight against Isis.Meanwhile, the Saudi monarchy and its regional allies are uneasy that events on the ground in Syria are being dictated by external powers, none of which are Arab. Emile Hokayem, the senior fellow for Middle East security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: “The idea of an Arab expeditionary force emerges every couple of years, and it’s always seen as a politically brilliant idea to create a sense of ownership in the region.“In reality, the politics of putting a force like that together are almost impossible.“The question is: have the Saudis consulted the other countries before speaking on their behalf? The Saudis thought Egypt and Pakistan would come to help Yemen and they didn’t.”The Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has launched an Islamic military counter-terrorism coalition, which held its first high-level meeting last year, but it has not appeared to be intended for combat.Charles Lister, the director of the extremism and counter-terrorism programme at the Middle East Institute (MEI), attended the inaugural conference and said the force was intended for training and assistance programmes, rather than combat operations.Lister said there was “no precedent” for an Arab expeditionary force in Syria. Any Saudi troops deployed to Syria would find themselves directly confronting Iranian fighters and their allies, which could prompt a dangerous escalation in the conflict. Randa Slim, who directs the back-channel Track II diplomacy programme at MEI said: “It is one thing for the Saudis to pay for other ‘Islamic forces’ to do the job, and a totally different thing to send their men to a conflict theatre where they are bound to enter into direct confrontation with an entrenched Iranian-Hezbollah force.“The other factor to consider is: what is Turkey’s response to this proposal? I do not see Ankara welcoming the positions of Egyptian andor Emirati forces on its border,” Slim said. The Obama administration also looked at the possibility of Arab allies deploying counter-terrorist forces against Isis in Syria, but Saudi Arabia and the UAE were drawn into the battle for Yemen against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels.Nicholas Heras, a fellow at the Center for a New American Security, said: “They preferred to send intelligence officers and money, rather than put troops on the ground.“But for the Saudis, the trouble is their territory is being breached by Houthis every day. It doesn’t make sense for them to shift their ground forces when they have trouble securing their own border.”Heras said it was more likely Saudi Arabia would seek to outsource recruitment to countries such as Pakistan and Sudan. “I’m sure the Saudis are up for fighting in Syria to the very last Sudanese soldier,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e00b0eb2ab4a4fc390ffae9992939da860f07f18/0_157_3020_1812/master/3020.jpg?w=3000\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f88fc658ffd3a850fcbf1846311d8b7 6000w","title":"a bomb silenced daphne caruana galizia but her investigation lives on","story":"The Daphne Project reveals the story so far behind the murder of a Maltese journalistby  Juliette Garside in MaltaThe explosion was so loud it shook the windows of the family home.In a cold panic, Matthew Caruana Galizia ran to the front door, barefoot. “That moment, opening the door, the dogs barking, the light, I just thought I was going to collapse on to the floor.”The neighbours were already outside. He sprinted past them, down the dirt track that leads to the village road, barely aware of the stones cutting into the soles of his feet. Halfway down he saw the column of black smoke.In front of him were the remains of a burning car, his mother’s. She had been inside it.The murder six months ago of the journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia sent shockwaves around the world.In Malta, the prime minister, Joseph Muscat, and his party stand accused of allowing corruption to go unpunished, of weakening the police and the judiciary, of allowing an environment in which her killing became possible.But it goes deeper than that. The European Union must now decide how to deal with its smallest member state – an island that appears to have become a magnet for criminals and kleptocrats, and that some MEPs fear has become a gateway for dirty money into the rest of the continent, including the UK.The profound questions raised by Caruana Galizia’s murder have become the focus of a new collaboration: the Daphne Project.With the support of her family, a group of 18 international media organisations, including the Guardian, Reuters and Le Monde, has come together. Led by Forbidden Stories, whose mission is to continue the work of silenced journalists, the group has spent months piecing together Caruana Galizia’s story and pursuing the investigations she was working on when she was killed.Today, the project launches with the story of her murder, of the men facing trial for the crime, and the enduring mystery of who ordered it, and why.Daphne Caruana Galizia had spent her last morning working at the dining room table opposite her eldest son, Matthew, 32. The air was still and heavy with the scent of wild fennel. The densely planted garden of her hilltop home in the northern village of Bidnija muffled any noise from the road. She was absorbed in her work, and the hours passed unnoticed.Just before 3pm Caruana Galizia hastily gathered her things – she was late for an appointment at the bank. She rushed out, came back for some forgotten cheques, then climbed into her car.As the charcoal grey Peugeot 108 headed south out of the village, she was being watched. For her killers, the moment had come a bomb placed under the driver’s seat was detonated by remote control.A neighbour, Francis Sant, who was driving in the opposite direction, recalls a first explosion, which sent out white smoke and debris. Moments later, there was a second, much larger blast and the vehicle caught fire, before careering off the road into fields.In an interview for this project, Sant said: “I am going to say something that I have never said before. Because I felt that I shouldn’t say it … I even heard her screaming … But as soon as she screamed she became a ball of fire.”As Matthew sprinted towards the scene, he remembers seeing a crater in the road. Trees were on fire. He could see glass, and plastic, and pieces of flesh.He couldn’t see the car but he could hear it the horn was blaring. He followed the noise and the smoke, all the while hoping it was not his mother’s vehicle.But then he recognised the licence plate. Circling, looking inside, there was nothing but orange fire. No sign of a body, no silhouette.He searched the ground for a stick to prise open what was left of the doors when he heard police sirens. “I was looking on the ground for something, and then I saw a leg. And I remember thinking to myself like OK … there is a leg on the ground, there are body parts up there, obviously no one could have survived this, so it’s pointless.”Soon, his mother’s sister arrived, and then, after some frantic phone calls, his father and two younger brothers. The family hunkered down in Bidnija, staying indoors for two weeks, avoiding the television crews. The days passed in a blur.But it was Matthew’s precise recollection of what his mother was doing in the minutes before she was killed that led to an apparent breakthrough in the murder inquiry.On 4 December last year, in an early morning swoop on the seedy port area of Marsa which involved soldiers arriving by boat and a Swat team storming in from the road, police arrested three men widely reported in Malta as being known to the police: brothers George and Alfred Degiorgio, aged 55 and 53 respectively, and their associate Vincent Muscat, 55.The brothers were ordered at gunpoint to lie on the ground. Muscat was handcuffed to an iron railing. Footage of the raid, shot from a soldier’s head camera, was released to the press.The focus of the operation that day was a large, rusty shed overlooking Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Known locally as the potato shed – it was once used for storing vegetables – the structure now shelters the colourful rowing boats of the Marsa Regatta Club.One end is fenced off. It contains weightlifting benches, a barbecue and a secure room with a metal door and shutters. Suspended from the ceiling are a Spider-Man toy, fishing tackle, and the severed heads and tails of marlin fish.This is where officers arrested the men – and where they suspect the murder was planned.“They used to come here at the beginning or the end of the day,” said one man who knew them. “Sometimes, they had visitors at night. They were the kind of people who, even in the middle of summer, they give you a chill.”The evidence that led police to suspect these men was compiled by Insp Keith Arnaud, a homicide detective who knew Daphne and had once tried to arrest her.His case has been set out in meticulous detail in testimony for an examining magistrate, who is deciding whether the accused should stand trial.Reviewed by the Guardian, the testimony shows how police zeroed in on the arrested men with help from the FBI and a team of forensic specialists from the Netherlands.They assumed the bomb had been triggered remotely, and had probably been linked to a mobile phone, so the question was: who was making calls that day, and from where?The evidence was provided by a major piece of FBI computer processing, undertaken in the US, and complicated by the fact that the Vodafone mast in Bidnija was “off grid” at the time of the murder.Thousands of calls redirected to other masts had to be sifted through before investigators believed they had found what they were looking for: the numbers of two devices that appear to have been used to detonate the bomb.Detectives believe the sim cards for the phones were bought almost a year before the murder, on 15 November 2016. The two numbers only ever communicated with each other.Further analysis revealed one of the sim cards was used in a basic Nokia handset the second, which Arnaud calls “the god device”, was attached to a circuit board like those used to switch on lights or central heating by remote control. Or, in this case, it seems, to detonate a bomb.Having apparently found the method for triggering the device, Arnaud’s team was unsure who had pressed the button.The intelligence services were already monitoring George Degiorgio’s personal phone, in connection with another investigation.Arnaud told the magistrate he was able to match the location data from George Degiorgio’s personal number with another device, thought to have been one of three “burner” phones acquired for the job. Over a period of weeks, they found the burner phones signalling to the network from the same masts as personal numbers used by the three accused.The data provided by the FBI showed that the night before the killing, all three burner phones were active in Bidnija. And at 1.41am, the circuit board sim was switched on.After that, the suspects headed their separate ways, Arnaud told the court. According to his account, Alfred Degiorgio spent the night in Bidnija and the other two left the village. By 6.15am on the day of the murder, George’s phones were allegedly signalling from the potato shed in Marsa. Shortly after that, they were said to be transmitting from the coastline around Valletta.Police matched the locations with CCTV footage and spotted a small cabin cruiser with a distinctive green hood. The boat, called the Maya, was registered in Alfred’s name, but the phone data led police to believe it was George at the helm that afternoon.At 2.55pm, the Maya stopped, idling along a sheltered stretch of water beneath a neoclassical whe ar memorial known as the Siege Bell. Minutes later, it is alleged, there were two phone calls to the boat, both from Bidnija. The first lasted 44sec the next, 1min 47sec.Arnaud’s testimony to the court explains: “If you look into why there were two calls, it matches perfectly with what Matthew Caruana Galizia said when he told us that when his mother left the house, she forgot the cheque book.“In our opinion … the spotter saw the victim come out, he informed the person at sea to prepare himself, the victim went into the house again, the call ended, but two minutes later it took place again.”At 2.58pm, a text message was sent to the “god device” containing a code designed to activate the circuit board in the bomb.Within minutes of the blast, Arnaud told the court, George was messaging his girlfriend: “Buy me wine, my love.” She replied: “OK.” At 4pm, CCTV shows the Maya cruising back towards its mooring.The police case relies upon the evidence provided by the phones, and more information may be forthcoming.A sweep of the harbour floor by army scuba ers led to the recovery of eight phones said to have been used by the accused.The Guardian understands that all the devices were sent to Europol in the Netherlands for analysis several weeks ago.Alongside the examining magistrate hearing police evidence against the alleged bombers, another magistrate, Anthony Vella, is investigating the murder. Europol, the FBI and a Maltese telecoms expert are reporting directly to him.The family’s hopes of discovering who ordered the killing rest with Vella, because they fear police will not pursue evidence that might lead to politicians. A source close to the investigation said police were focused on finding the bomb maker, and tracing any possible links to organised crime.Vella is “a very thorough, meticulous, no-nonsense person”, says the family’s lawyer, Jason Azzopardi. “The fact that these international experts are answerable to the magistrate is the way it should be because this case has reverberations that go beyond the shores of Malta.”The three suspects have said nothing since their arrest. George, known by the street name ic-Ciniz (the Chinese), simply pulled out his identity card and placed it on the interrogation room table during police questioning. Alfred, or il-Fulu (the Bean), would not even confirm his name.The Guardian understands that detectives suspect the men had been tipped off before their arrest. When officers came for them in Marsa, the phones they had allegedly used were already on the seabed, and George had his partner’s mobile number written on his hand.The Nationalist MP and former opposition leader Simon Busuttil is concerned that the raid appeared staged: “The assault was fully filmed and everything looked pre-set for maximum propaganda effect. Footage of the assault was quicky circulated on the media and looked like something out of a Marvel action film – theatrical.”All three men entered not guilty pleas and accepted legal aid, but declined to speak to their lawyers.They have yet to stand trial, and any suggestion they were acting on orders remains speculation.Certainly, Caruana Galizia had many enemies and many critics. She took aim at anyone she believed needed to be held to account – mobsters, business people, even the current leader of the Nationalist party, with which she had been closely aligned.Caruana Galizia’s second son, Andrew, lays the blame at the feet of the ruling Labour party.“Maltese citizens are completely naked when they interact with their state,” he said. “There’s no independent institution in between the citizen and the government. Her assassination became possible for that reason.”In the aftermath of the attack, and without the consent of the family, the government offered a €1m (£870,000) reward for information leading to the killers. Despite the arrests, it remains on the table.In a statement emailed by his spokesman, the prime minister said: “An investigation is ongoing into those who ordered the killing. I trust the Maltese police will investigate this case with full professionalism, and without fear or favour.” Muscat added that the murder had “shocked and outraged” him. “No prime minister would want a journalist to be murdered under any circumstances. This was an attack on our society and such a senseless act particularly affects a country our size. This murder does not reflect on the Maltese people, who enjoy a liberal, open and democratic society. The government is clear that the police will have whatever resources they need to pursue and prosecute those responsible.”The stakes for both Malta and the EU remain high.And for a family torn apart by the murder, there is anger, bewilderment, and an overwhelming feeling of loss.Matthew’s brother Paul, 29, flew in from London on the night of the murder and was confronted by a sight he will never forget.Their peaceful valley was, he says, unrecognisable: the familiar fields were floodlit, the road choked with police and television crews.As Andrew puts it: “It felt like the world had collapsed and no one was safe any more. Apart from my mother being taken away I also felt that my country had been taken away.”15 November 2016: Sim cards for mobile devices allegedly used to trigger the bomb are purchased.10 January 2017: The trigger sims are activated for the first time, in the area of Żebbuġ. One is placed inside a Nokia handset and used to send four text messages to the other, placed in a circuit board. After 20 minutes, the sims are switched off.19 August: Three burner phones believed to have been used by the bombers are activated within 20 minutes of each other.21 August: Trigger sims are switched on for the second time, and two text messages are sent between them. This appears to be a second test run.End of September: White rental car seen for the first time in the vicinity of Bidnija. Over the coming weeks it is spotted many times, parked near a lookout point.15 October: All three burner phones are located in Bidnija. Alfred Degiorgio’s personal phone and the device said to be his burner phone appear to remain there all night and most of the following day.16 October:1.41am - Trigger sim is switched on. It signals from Bidnija, where Caruana Galizia’s car is parked outside her home.8am - The Maya is filmed on CCTV leaving Valletta’s Grand Harbour. Phone data suggests only George Degiorgio was on board.8.30am – The Vodafone mast in Bidnija goes off grid and is closed for maintenance until 6pm.2.55pm - CCTV shows the Maya stopping in sheltered water beneath the Siege Bell war memorial.2.58pm –  Text message is allegedly sent from the boat to the circuit board sim, detonating a bomb placed under the driver’s seat of Caruana Galizia’s car.3.20pm – Phone data shows the Maya heading back towards the harbour.3.30pm - George Degiorgio sends a message from his personal phone to his partner: “Buy me wine, my love.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dcee9834254e928805c39c8ae51665966a55bec0/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=9a1abb1b37b2bf010fefdeb4625823fd 1240w","title":"face transplants jerome hamon first french man two","story":"A French man is recovering in a Paris hospital after becoming the first person in the world to undergo two face transplants. Jérôme Hamon, who suffers from a condition which causes disfiguring tumours, underwent his first transplant in 2010, but his body eventually rejected his new face which had to be removed.He is now in a Paris hospital, three months after undergoing an unprecedented second transplant carried out by Laurent Lantieri, the same professor of plastic surgery who carried out the first procedure.Hamon’s new face remains smooth and motionless, with his skull, skin and features yet to be fully aligned – a gradual process reliant on immunosuppressant drugs which, it is hoped, will prevent his body from rejecting the transplanted material. “I feel very well in myself,” Hamon, 43, told reporters. “I can’t wait to get rid of all this,” he said.Hamon suffers from neurofibromatosis type 1, a genetic mutation which causes severe disfiguration and related complications. His first face transplant in 2010 was a success. But that same year – in order to treat a common cold – he was given an antibiotic incompatible with his immunosuppressive treatment. In 2016 he began to display signs of transplant rejection, and his new face began to die, leading Lantieri to remove it. That left Hamon without a face, a condition that Lantieri described as “the walking dead”. Hamon had no eyelids, no ears, no skin and could not speak or eat. He had limited hearing and could express himself only by turning his head slightly, in addition to writing a little. “If you have no skin, you have infections,” Lantieri told the Associated Press on Tuesday. “We were very concerned about the possibility of a new rejection.”Hamon remained in hospital without a face for two months, while a compatible donor was sought. Eventually, a second face donor became available, and Lantieri and his team performed a second transplant in January. Before undergoing the second transplant, doctors had to replace all of the blood in his body in a month-long procedure, to eliminate some potentially problematic antibodies from previous treatments.“For a man who went through all this, which is like going through a nuclear war, he’s doing fine,” Lantieri said. He added that Hamon is now being monitored like any other face transplant patient.Hamon’s first face was donated by a 60-year-old. With his second transplanted face, Hamon said he managed to drop a few decades.“I’m 43. The donor was 22. So I’ve become 20 years younger,” Hamon joked on French television on Tuesday.Despite all the anxiety and suffering, Hamon said he was a happy man again. “The first transplant I accepted immediately. I thought ‘this is my new face’ and this time it’s the same,” he told AFP. “If I hadn’t accepted this new face it would have been terrible.

The measure is likely to affect ZTE as well as the Chinese smartphone maker, Huawei, two of China’s largest telecommunication companies.China responded on Wednesday that it has contingency plans for dealing with trade frictions. Yan Pengcheng, spokesman for the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s economic planning agency, said at a news conference that any impact on the Chinese economy from a trade dispute would be limited and manageable.The latest moves by the US open another chapter in rising trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. US President Donald Trump has threatened punitive tariffs on $150bn of annual Chinese imports, while China has threatened retaliatory tariffs on US exports such as soybeans, vehicles and aircraft. Both sides have signalled some willingness to negotiate. In a speech earlier this month, Chinese President Xi Jinping promised to further open up the Chinese economy, protect intellectual property and loosen restrictions on foreign investors in manufacturing sectors such as the auto industry. China, home to the world’s largest auto market, requires foreign carmakers to partner with local manufacturers and share ownership. The NDRC this week released a plan to phase out those rules by 2022 and to scrap them entirely for electric vehicle companies by the end of this year.Still, US regulations on Chinese technology companies could add to a growing backlash in China. Messages on social media have called for consumers to boycott popular US establishments popular such as McDonald’s, KFC and Apple.The editor of the state-run tabloid Global Times, known for its nationalist editorials, called on Chinese citizens to stand up for its technology companies. “Tonight, me and the staff at Global Times are all ZTE,” he said on Weibo in a widely shared post."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd673b1b51c09e2540fe115527a06191bd63bea3/0_27_1428_857/master/1428.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=75fa8643351789ab5c1f2d04c5fb0ea2 1240w","title":"raul castro cuba step down leader miguel diaz canel","story":"Cubans greet end of the Castro era with indifference, not hope, as current vice-president Miguel Díaz-Canel is expected to replace RaúlWhen Cuba’s president stands down this week, it will mark the first time in nearly six decades that the island will be led by somebody whose last name is not Castro.The Cuban national assembly meets this Wednesday to elect the next president, and Raúl Castro is widely expected to be replaced by the current vice-president Miguel Díaz-Canel.The handover will mark the end of an era: Cuba without the Castros has been the holy grail for Florida-based Cuban exiles – and a policy vigorously pursued by a dozen successive US presidents. But on the streets of Havana, indifference – not hope – is in the air.No posters or billboards referring to the changeover are to be seen, the identity of the new leader is hardly a topic of conversation, and nobody doubts that the existing political system will remain intact. As the Cuban saying goes: nobody can fix it, but nobody can knock it down.“A new president isn’t going to change anything so it’s not important for me,” shrugged María Victoria Esteves, 27, on her way to buy bread. “I think everything’s going to stay the same.”Yadiel Sintra, 30, a builder working in Cuba’s private sector said he wasn’t even aware the country was about to get a new president. “I’ve just found out talking to you!” he said.Díaz-Canel is widely expected to represent continuity, and few Cubans expect any dramatic shift, said Rafael Hernández, a political analyst and member of the Communist party.  There are no direct presidential elections in Cuba. When legislators for the National Assembly were elected this March, 605 candidates stood unopposed. Every one was elected.“If a newpresident were to represent a fundamental change in people’s lives, Cubans would be very focused on this,” he said. “But the fact is they don’t see it like this.”Though relieved of the presidency, Castro, 86, will remain a political presence, staying on as first secretary of the Communist party until 2021.“The new president will have more power in the day-to-day,” said Hal Klepak, author of a biography of Raúl Castro. “But whenever there are crises or major problems with the US, foreign policy, or the economy, Raúl’s word will remain the last word.”Díaz-Canel, a cautious reformist hand-picked by Raúl Castro, will be expected to walk the tightrope of implementing more market-oriented reforms without sacrificing Cuba’s social policies.Health and education remain free at the point of use in Cuba. The country has the most doctors per capita of any country in the Americas, and life expectancy is 79. And while Cubans on state salaries feel the pinch when buying meat and vegetables, essential foodstuffs are guaranteed by the state.Human rights groups say that the government continues to punish dissent and public criticism. The number of long-term political prisoners in Cuba dropped significantly under Raúl Castro, as the government shifted from long-term incarceration to short-term arrest and release, which typically lasts hours. But the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation say that last year more than 5,000 people were arrested for political reasons. Although in government for over a decade, Díaz-Canel’s politics are unknown to most Cubans. His relative obscurity reflects the top-down way public affairs are practised in an island where there is only one legal political party, and where political campaigning is prohibited by law.A former minister of higher education, Díaz-Canel has been criticised for coming across as stiff in his occasional media appearances, but his image is radically different from the late Fidel Castro and his brother Raúl. As the first secretary of the provincial Communist party in Villa Clara province in the 1990s he was known for his long hair, riding his bicycle and walking around in Bermuda shorts. He was a strong advocate for LGBT rights at a time when homosexuality was frowned upon in the province and by many in the party.Crucially, he was born after the Cuban revolution. If elected, Díaz-Canel will also be the first non-soldier in charge of the nation since 1959.“Accusations that Cuba is a military dictatorship have cut deep,” said Klepak. “It’s useful to have somebody who has come up through the system and didn’t arrive there through the use of arms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4907b98745ce24b6f5dfcc25bf8e5c3f102283e/0_0_4579_2747/master/4579.jpg?w=4500\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=191fd731510b971bdb2f4e9d5b269ded 9000w","title":"wednesday briefing brexit coming at too high a price","story":"Theresa May faces test in parliament as thinktank reveals cost of leaving … Barbara Bush dies aged 92 … and Cuba heads into post-Castro eraTheresa May faces test in parliament as thinktank reveals cost of leaving … Barbara Bush dies aged 92 … and Cuba heads into post-Castro eraHello – Warren Murray bringing you the news in the middle of the week.Each of the government’s four Brexit scenarios would leave Britain poorer and cost the taxpayer hundreds of millions of pounds per week, analysis by a thinktank has found.The study for Global Future is based on the government’s own Brexit impact studies, as well as other official sources. It forecasts that Theresa May’s preferred “bespoke” deal with the EU would leave Britain £40bn worse off per year, or £615m per week. Polling commissioned for the study by Populus found that even voters who backed Brexit at the referendum now fear that leaving the European Union comes at “too high a price”.Today, Theresa May is facing a potential stymie to her plans, bespoke or otherwise, as an amendment to let parliament vote on a continued customs union with the EU comes before the House of Lords. Nine senior Conservatives, including two former cabinet ministers, are among those who have put their names to a series of cross-party amendments aimed at persuading the PM to rethink her position.Barbara Bush dies – She was the wife of one president and mother of a second. Barbara Bush has died aged 92. The staunch Republican matriarch had heart problems and, following several recent hospitalisations, she opted to receive only “comfort care”, according to a family spokesman. Barbara Bush was married to George HW Bush, who became president in 1989, and their children included George W Bush, who was declared winner of the 2000 election in highly controversial circumstances. In 2013, when a presidential run by her son Jeb was mooted, she famously said that the country had had “enough Bushes”.‘A machine against one person’ – The Guardian has joined 18 news organisations from 15 countries to launch the Daphne project, continuing the anti-corruption investigations being carried out by Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia when she was murdered with a car bomb. Caruana Galizia challenged many who hold power and influence in Malta: mobsters, business people, public officials, lawyers, the governing Labour party and the current leader of the opposition Nationalists.“They found it difficult to attack what she said, so instead they attacked her on a personal level,” says her widowed husband, Peter, who now lives under police protection. As the investigations continue, we will share revelations from a cache of 680,000 files leaked to Caruana Galizia in the final months of her life.Quick catch-up – Here is what’s fresh in the week’s developing stories.\u0026gt Overnight, South Korea has confirmed it is seeking a peace treaty to officially end the war with the North. Meanwhile US officials have confirmed that the CIA chief secretly visited North Korea and met Kim Jong-un over Easter to lay the groundwork for Donald Trump’s proposed meeting with Kim. \u0026gt The government destroyed the landing cards from thousands of Windrush-era arrivals in a measure that has been blamed in part for the current immigration debacle. A former Home Office employee said the cards had been a vital tool over the years to confirm the residency rights of Caribbean-born British citizens.\u0026gt Medics in Douma say they have been intimidated by the Syrian regime as it seeks to conceal the evidence of a chemical weapons attack. International inspectors are due to visit Douma today but Russia is being accused of delaying tactics. Patrick Wintour explains why Syria still possesses these weapons after it was supposed to have given them up.\u0026gt Labour MPs have rounded on Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership in a Commons debate on antisemitism. “Antisemitism is making me an outsider in my Labour party. Enough is enough,” said Dame Margaret Hodge. Other Labour backbenchers were cheered and applauded as they made impassioned speeches.‘This is my new face’ – A French man has become the first patient in the world to have a face transplant twice. Jérôme Hamon needed the first procedure in 2010 because of a genetic disease. But his immune system eventually began to reject the donor face and it had to be removed. After months in hospital waiting for another face, a replacement was grafted into place in January. “The first transplant I accepted immediately. I thought ‘this is my new face’ and this time it’s the same,” said Hamon.Sandwiches and coffee – There’s a kick and a kiss for the fast-food business today. Pret a Manger has been censured by the advertising watchdog for callings its sandwiches “natural” when they’ve got E-numbers in them. Costa Coffee, though, has won praise for pledging to recycle the same number of disposable cups it turns over each year, by incentivising waste companies that have the special facilities to pulp them. “It dispels the myth that coffee cups can’t be recycled,” said Dominic Paul, managing director of Costa.‘Silent epidemic’ – Today in our Small Changes podcast series on remarkable iniduals tackling the world’s problems, meet the Kenyan cattle herder who became a doctor and malaria researcher as part of his lifelong mission to conquer the disease.The era of Castro rule is about to end – but on the street most Cubans seem indifferent. “I think everything’s going to stay the same,” says María Victoria Esteves, 27, about the news that President Raúl Castro will cede office this week to his vice-president, Miguel Díaz-Canel. Others are not even aware when canvassed, Ed Augustin discovers in Havana.Díaz-Canel is widely expected to represent continuity, and few Cubans expect any dramatic shift in the Communist rule imposed by Fidel Castro six decades ago. His younger brother, now aged 86, will stay on as first secretary of the party until 2021 – “Raúl’s word will remain the last word,” says Cuba expert Hal Klepak. Brighton and Hove Albion have arrested a concerning run in the Premier League of one point from the last 15 with a much improved showing against Tottenham Hotspur. But the result left Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino lamenting a “lack of aggression” in a game he believed his side had dominated. Meanwhile, Wolves’ promotion next season will see the club come under closer scrutiny regarding its arrangement with Portuguese super-agent, Jorge Mendes.TalkSPORT has announced a massive shake-up in cricket broadcasting, securing the free-to-air broadcast rights of England’s forthcoming tours of Sri Lanka and the West Indies in a significant blow to the BBC. Elsewhere, Surrey’s Australian coach, Michael Di Venuto, has called for people to stop hounding disgraced cricketers Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft, floating the idea that the trio could find a home in domestic cricket. And finally a new stadium for Cornish Pirates rugby club could be closer to realisation with Cornwall’s council agreeing to help meet construction costs.Asian shares crept ahead on Wednesday after Wall Street took heart from upbeat corporate earnings, though nagging concerns about trade barriers and the global growth outlook kept currencies and bonds subdued. China announced a timetable to open up its car market to imports, meeting a longtime demand of the US and other countries but hitting shares in China’s own automakers.The pound traded at $1.429 and €1.155 overnight. Discord within Labour and a fresh insult to Windrush families are among the stories that make the front pages today. The Times and the Telegraph both splash on growing dissent within the opposition over its leader’s stance on the Jewish community. The Telegraph says: “Enough is enough: Labour fury at Corbyn over anti-Semitism” while the Times goes with “Tensions in Labour erupt over rising abuse of Jews.”The Guardian keeps up the pressure on the government over citizens who came to Britain from the Caribbean with the lead story: “Home Office destroyed key data on Windrush citizens.” The Mail sings a similar tune with “Windrush: the new betrayal.” The Express, meanwhile, has a question for the former chancellor, after treasury said Britain was booming: “So George just how accurate was project fear then?” The Sun leads on Granbo (a pun on Rambo?) – the woman who shot an intruder with a crossbow.

Image: Screenshot from Facebook videoAn online video of an Irish actor confronting a man removing posters, erected by campaigners for a “Yes” vote in the abortion referendum, from telephone poles in Limerick has been viewed thousands of times.Kevin Kiely jnr, who appeared in The Dark Knight Rises and World War Z, recorded a man taking down the posters and posted the footage on his Facebook account. The posters carry the emblem of the socialist feminist movement Rosa, and bear the slogan “Stop Shaming Women!”. When Kiely asks the man why he is removing the posters, he is heard replying: “None of your business”. The man does not reply when Kiely asks him: “Do you disagree about stopping shaming women, in 2018, that you have to tear the posters down off the wall?”Kiely then says: “C’mon, I’ll put you on the internet and you can tell the internet why you tore them down . . . You’ll go on Facebook tonight.” The man is filmed apparently trying to prevent Kiely from recording him. He asks Kiely to “stop filming” him. Kiely replies: “No I won’t. You’re in a public place. You just did something that is destruction of somebody’s else’s property in a public place, and I filmed you.” The man then removes two more posters from a pole and walks off. Asked why he confronted the man and filmed him, Kiely said he believed removing the posters was an act of “censorship”, and added, “I can’t condone that.” “There are ‘No’ posters and ‘Yes’ posters all the up along the street and people can vote for whoever they want. That’s why we live in a democracy,” he said.

Photograph: Google MapsDublin City Council has taken legal proceedings against large city centre pub Opium amid complaints from local residents and businesses following a multimillion euro makeover.The Mercantile Group establishment, which describes itself as a “pan-Asian restaurant, cocktail bar and nightlife destination” closed in May last year and reopened in January after a revamp estimated to have cost between €2 million and €4 million.In a recent letter to councillors, the Camden Village Residents’ \u0026amp Business Association said it had received an “unprecedented” number of noise complaints since the pub installed a rooftop smoking area and opening glass roof on its premises.Dublin City Council last month refused retention permission on the roof works and said it has now started legal proceedings over alterations that it says were carried out without proper planning permission.In its letter, the Camden association said “people cannot get a night’s sleep as the crowd noise from these open areas inside this venue can be heard very often until 2.30am or later”.It accused the Mercantile Group of behaving badly by failing to adhere to an enforcement notice issued by Dublin City Council last October.In response to a question from Fianna Fáil councillor Frank Kennedy, council management said “there is a live file on Opium, 26 Wexford Street”. “A Section 154 Notice was served on 13th October, 2017, requiring the removal of the steel structure and glazed roof and the reinstatement of the curved bitumen covered roof by 15th December, 2017. “The notice was not complied with and the matter is now the subject of legal proceedings.”A planning authority may issue a notice under section 154 of the Planning and Development Act if development does not have the required permission, or where terms of permission have not been met.The council said it refused to grant retention permission because the development gives rise to unacceptable noise levels and creates unacceptable noise levels which negatively affect the “residential environmental quality of the area”.The council carried out sound monitoring in the bedroom of a property on Camden Row over three days in February. “On each of these occasions crowd noise and music with a high bass content were clearly audible and at a level that would be considered intrusive,” the Dublin’s environmental health officer said.Opium is one of a number of Dublin establishments in the Mercantile hospitality group. Last year it lined up a €20 million investment programme, after its warring shareholder blocs formally ended a bitter legal wrangle.The Mercantile Group did not respond to a request for comment.Thank you for signing up.You will start to receive Daily Digests from newsdigest@comms.irishtimes.com.Please add this email address to your address book.Which Daily Digest would you like?Invalid email or password."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/12/TELEMMGLPICT000002395664_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6L3Bx11x18zbsv4k04trOP3QFo7fDZgyggOOCRYToPs.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"cant think rationallywithout emotions feature not bug","story":"Future AIs might be susceptible to something like depressionDoes intelligence have to be conscious?

But that same year - in order to treat nothing more than a common cold - he was given an antibiotic incompatible with his immunosuppressive treatment.In 2016 he began to display signs of transplant rejection, and his new face deteriorated.Last summer Hamon was hospitalised and in November his face, suffering from necrosis, had to be removed.He remained in hospital without a face for two months, a very difficult time, while a compatible donor was sought.Everyone at the hospital \u0026quotwas blown away by Jerome\u0027s courage, his will, his strength of character in a tragic situation. While he was waiting he never complained, he was even in a good mood,\u0026quot recalled Bernard Cholley, an anaesthetist.Eventually, a face donor was found, a 22-year-old man who had died hundreds of kilometres from Paris. Lantieri heard the news on a Sunday in January and the massive logistical and medical operation was swiftly launched.The donor face was transported as quickly as possible by road on the Monday to the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris.By late morning the following day, Hamon was being wheeled back to his hospital bed following the ground-breaking surgery, with his medical team noticing encouraging signs of good colour in his new face.The operation answers a key question for Lantieri and the rest of the medical world \u0026quotCan we redo a facial transplant? Yes, we can re-transplant and this is what you get!\u0026quotThe French medical team and Jerome Hanon at the Hopital Europeen Georges-Pompidou in ParisTo avoid any rejection, the patient underwent three months of special blood treatment prior to the transplant, nephrologist Eric Thervet explained.Despite all the anxiety and suffering, Hamon is a happy man again.\u0026quotThe first transplant I accepted immediately. I thought \u0027this is my new face\u0027 and this time it\u0027s the same,\u0026quot he explained.\u0026quotIf I hadn\u0027t accepted this new face it would have been terrible. It\u0027s a question of identity... But here we are, it\u0027s good, it\u0027s me.\u0026quotThere have now been around 40 face transplants throughout the world since the first was performed on Frenchwoman Isabelle Dinoire in northern France in 2005.Please review our commenting policySouthwest Airlines emergency landing: Banking executive killed after being sucked out of window at 32,000ftStephen Lawrence: How the racist murder changed BritainPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsFormer first lady Barbara Bush dies aged 92Queen devastated by loss of her last remaining corgi Royal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsMalaysian fashion critic suggests those weighing more than 60kg should not attend catwalk showsCIA director Mike Pompeo \u0026#39had secret meeting with Kim Jong-un\u0026#39 ahead of planned Trump summitChildren\u0026#39s own \u0026#39sex selfies\u0026#39 fuelling rise in child abuse imagesCitizenship test for migrants full of errors and omissions, House of Lords says NHS accused of \u0026#39alarming\u0026#39 failure to tackle cyber security despite growing Russian threatCommonwealth leaders pledge to renew fight against malaria\u0026#39In Nigeria you can never escape malaria\u0026#39\u0026#39Imagine the worst flu you\u0026#39ve ever had and times it by 10\u0026#39\u0026#39I lost two years of my education to malaria\u0026#39Paradise Hunters, review – the casting was so spot-on that a familiar formula never felt too tiredWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 17 april 2018","story":"Flowers blooming at Alnwick Castle, a sumo tournament at Yasukuni Shrine and Mother\u0027s Day in Kathmandu are some of Tuesday\u0027s pictures of the dayPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsSouthwest Airlines emergency landing: Banking executive killed after being sucked out of window at 32,000ftFormer first lady Barbara Bush dies aged 92Queen devastated by loss of her last remaining corgi Stephen Lawrence: How the racist murder changed BritainRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsMalaysian fashion critic suggests those weighing more than 60kg should not attend catwalk showsCIA director Mike Pompeo \u0026#39had secret meeting with Kim Jong-un\u0026#39 ahead of planned Trump summitChildren\u0026#39s own \u0026#39sex selfies\u0026#39 fuelling rise in child abuse imagesCitizenship test for migrants full of errors and omissions, House of Lords says NHS accused of \u0026#39alarming\u0026#39 failure to tackle cyber security despite growing Russian threatCommonwealth leaders pledge to renew fight against malaria\u0026#39In Nigeria you can never escape malaria\u0026#39\u0026#39Imagine the worst flu you\u0026#39ve ever had and times it by 10\u0026#39\u0026#39I lost two years of my education to malaria\u0026#39Paradise Hunters, review – the casting was so spot-on that a familiar formula never felt too tiredWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/17/TELEMMGLPICT000153741237_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqZBBY0HLu3IbgpGNGdxVYBLCEjiMsJoNODBKSsYJu7JA.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"queen devastated loss last remaining corgi","story":"Daniel Craig and Queen Elizabeth II with her corgisThe Queen has reportedly been hit “extremely hard” by the loss of her corgi Willow who died on Sunday - ending Her Majesty’s close association with the breed dating back eight decades.The dog, which was 14th generation and descended from the Queen’s first dog Susan, was suffering from a cancer-related illness.It’s understood The Queen didn’t want Willow, who was almost 15, to suffer any further. Insiders said she was hit “extremely hard” by the loss of Willow, who had become her most devoted companion.  As a descendant of Susan, who was an 18th birthday present when she was then Princess Elizabeth, Willow had a particularly close link with the Queen.On her 90th birthday, when she posed for portraits with her grandchildren, she also let her dogs share the limelight. Willow was one of four dogs at the time who featured in a picture with her, taken on steps in the grounds of Windsor castle.Corgis have played a massive role in Her Majesty\u0026#39s lifeThe dog also featured in the now infamous James Bond sketch with Daniel Craig for the London Olympics opening ceremony, alongside Holly - who died at Balmoral aged 13 back in 2016.A Buckingham Palace source told the Daily Mail: “She has mourned every one of her corgis over the years, but she has been more upset about Willow’s death than any of them… It is probably because Willow was the last link to her parents and a pastime that goes back to her own childhood. It really does feel like the end of an era.”She does still have one last corgi, called Whisper, which she agreed to adopt after the death of his owner, who was a former Sandringham gamekeeper. She also has two dorgis – corgi-dachsund crosses – called Vulcan and Candy.It was reported that the Queen was still feeding and exercising Willow until the weekend, but the dog’s condition worsened. A vet was then said to have been called on Sunday afternoon, when Prince Philip was able to rejoin her after nearly two weeks in hospital following a hip operation.In 2015, the Queen decided to stop breeding Pembroke Welsh corgis over fears she might trip over and hurt herself over them. It was also reported that she didn’t want to leave any behind when she dies.Yet during her time looking after them, she has had more than 30 corgis stemming from Susan’s puppies Sugar and Honey, who were born in 1949.Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the reports, saying it would be a private matter.Please review our commenting policyPrince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s royal wedding: date, details and latest newsSouthwest Airlines emergency landing: Banking executive killed after being sucked out of window at 32,000ftFormer first lady Barbara Bush dies aged 92Stephen Lawrence: How the racist murder changed BritainRoyal baby: Duchess of Cambridge\u0026#39s due date, possible names and all the latest newsMalaysian fashion critic suggests those weighing more than 60kg should not attend catwalk showsCIA director Mike Pompeo \u0026#39had secret meeting with Kim Jong-un\u0026#39 ahead of planned Trump summitChildren\u0026#39s own \u0026#39sex selfies\u0026#39 fuelling rise in child abuse imagesCitizenship test for migrants full of errors and omissions, House of Lords says NHS accused of \u0026#39alarming\u0026#39 failure to tackle cyber security despite growing Russian threatCommonwealth leaders pledge to renew fight against malaria\u0026#39In Nigeria you can never escape malaria\u0026#39\u0026#39Imagine the worst flu you\u0026#39ve ever had and times it by 10\u0026#39\u0026#39I lost two years of my education to malaria\u0026#39Paradise Hunters, review – the casting was so spot-on that a familiar formula never felt too tiredStephen: The Murder That Changed a Nation, review – a devastating account of incompetence and excusesWe rely on advertising to help fund our award-winning journalism.We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The Telegraph website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Thank you for your support.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"southwest airlines plane makes emergency landing engine broke","story":"A banking executive has died after being partially sucked out of a window of a US plane when an engine exploded in mid-air.Jennifer Riordan, a 43-year-old vice-president at Wells Fargo, was left hanging half outside the Southwest Airlines passenger jet at 32,000ft.Passengers scrambled to save the mother of two, who was partly sucked out of the Boeing 737 when the widow was smashed by debris. Mrs Riordan, who was returning from a business trip, later died and seven others were injured.The pilot, Tammie Jo Shults, was praised for her cool-headed handling of the emergency and described as having \u0026quotnerves of steel\u0026quot. In an air traffic control recording released by NBC News, the former Navy pilot is heard saying: \u0026quotWe have a part of the aircraft missing, so we\u0027re going to need to slow down a bit.\u0026quotAsked if the plane is on fire, she says it is not but adds: \u0026quotThey said there is a hole and someone went out.\u0026quotJennifer Riordan was left hanging half outside the Southwest Airlines passenger jet when a window was smashed by debrisSouthwest Airlines Flight 1380 was bound for Dallas from New York and had 149 people on board when it went into a rapid descent on Tuesday.The twin-engine jet made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after a window, wings and fuselage were damaged. Witnesses reported an engine on the left side of the plane blew, smashing a window and causing cabin depressurisation that nearly sucked the woman out of the aircraft. Mrs Riordan was pulled back in by other passengers, but later died.The seat where the victim was sitting when the engine reportedly hit into and broke one of the plane\u0026#39s windowsInitial findings said an engine fan blade was missing. According to the National Transportation Safety Board, the shattered window had showed evidence of \u0026quotmetal fatigue\u0026quotPhotos of the plane on the ground showed a missing window and a chunk gone from the left engine, including part of its cover. A piece of the engine covering was later found in Bernville, Pennsylvania, about 70 miles west of Philadelphia.Photos posted by passengers showed a heavily damaged window near the damaged engine. Passengers reported seeing a woman being given medical attention on the plane.“One passenger, a woman, was partially … was drawn out towards the outside of the plane … was pulled back in by other passengers,\u0026quot Todd Burr, the father of another passenger, told NBC10.Oxygen masks dropped from the ceiling and passengers said their prayers and braced for impact.Investigators examine damage to the engine of the Southwest Airlines plane \u0026quotI just remember holding my husband\u0027s hand, and we just prayed and prayed and prayed,\u0026quot said passenger Amanda Bourman, of New York.\u0026quotAnd the thoughts that were going through my head of course were about my daughters, just wanting to see them again and give them a big hug so they wouldn\u0027t grow up without parents.\u0026quotMs Bourman said she was seated near the back and was asleep when she heard a loud noise and oxygen masks dropped. She said the plane was fairly quiet because everyone was wearing a mask.Passengers on board the plane wear oxygen masks \u0026quotEverybody was crying and upset,\u0026quot she said. \u0026quotYou had a few passengers that were very strong, and they kept yelling to people, you know, \u0027It\u0027s OK! We\u0027re going to do this!\u0027\u0026quotShe added that passengers clapped and praised the pilot after the aircraft touched down.Passenger Marty Martinez went on Facebook Live while wearing an oxygen mask.

Emergency landing!! Southwest flight from NYC to Dallas!!\u0026quotVideo: Passenger records mid-air drama on FacebookAfter the plane landed, he posted photos of a broken window near the left engine.Ms Bourman said she saw emergency workers using a defibrillator to help a woman who was then taken off the plane. She said that she also saw a man rush to cover the broken window and that the man had a bandage around his arm after the plane landed.Passengers did \u0026quotsome pretty amazing things under some pretty difficult circumstances,\u0026quot Mr Thiel said.Tammie Jo Shults, a former Navy pilot, was at the controls when the plane made the emergency landing. She walked through the aisle and talked to passengers to make sure they were OK after the aircraft touched down.\u0026quotShe has nerves of steel. That lady, I applaud her,\u0026quot said Alfred Tumlinson, of Corpus Christi, Texas. \u0026quotI\u0027m going to send her a Christmas card, I\u0027m going to tell you that, with a gift certificate for getting me on the ground.

He couldn\u0027t do it by himself, so another gentleman came over and helped to get her back in the plane, and they got her,\u0026quot he said.Passengers struggled to somehow plug the hole while giving the badly injured woman CPR.As the plane came in for a landing, everyone started yelling to brace for impact, then clapped after the aircraft touched down safely, Bourman said.The Federal Aviation Administration said the crew reported damage to one of the engines, the fuselage and at least one window.The NTSB sent a team of investigators to Philadelphia. Sumwalt said the engine will be taken apart and examined to understand what caused the failure.Southwest has about 700 planes, all of them 737s, including more than 500 737-700s like the one in Tuesday\u0027s incident.It is the world\u0027s largest operator of the 737. The 737 is the best-selling jetliner in the world and has a good safety record.The jet\u0027s CFM56-7B engines were made by CFM International, jointly owned by General Electric and Safran Aircraft Engines of France.CFM said it sent technical experts to help NTSB investigators. In a statement, it said the CFM56-7B has had \u0026quotan outstanding safety and reliability record\u0026quot since its debut in 1997, powering more than 6,700 aricraft worldwide.John Goglia, a former NTSB member, said investigators will take the engine apart and look at its maintenance records as well.\u0026quotThere\u0027s a ring around the engine that\u0027s meant to contain the engine pieces when this happens,\u0026quot Goglia said. \u0026quotIn this case it didn\u0027t. That\u0027s going to be a big focal point for the NTSB - why didn\u0027t (the ring) do its job?\u0026quot\u0026quotWe\u0027re pushing the engines to produce as much power as possible,\u0026quot he added. \u0026quotWe\u0027re right on the edge. Sometimes they fail, and that\u0027s why the containment ring is there.\u0026quotA Southwest Airlines flight made an emergency landing in Philadelphia after one of its engines blew out mid airThe engine failure was reminiscent of a similar event on a Southwest Boeing 737-700 jet in August 2016 as it flew from New Orleans to Orlando, Florida.Shrapnel from the engine left a 5-by-16-inch hole just above the wing, and the oxygen masks dropped. The plane landed safely in Pensacola, Florida.NTSB investigators said one of the engine\u0027s fan blades broke off during the flight, apparently because of metal fatigue.Family, friends and community

who paid £5,000 to have her leg amputated after an ingrowing toenail left her battling sepsis now plans to compete in the Paralympics.Hannah Moore, 21, has been fitted with a £10,000 revolutionary prosthetic “cycling leg”, custom made to help her improve her times and qualify for Tokyo 2020 as a triathlete.Her family paid for her to have her right leg amputated below the knee two years ago after years of excruciating pain had left her in a wheelchair.She had undergone a routine procedure for an ingrowing toenail when she was 15 but it triggered a rare, debilitating condition called Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) that blighted her life for four years.Miss Moore, from Sherborne, Dorset, a former national karate champion, suffered with severe pain and swelling as the blood

Ulcers formed on her foot and, despite more than 50 operations and numerous skin grafts, they would not heal.After years of excruciating pain, Hannah says having her amputation was \u0026#39the best decision I’ve ever made\u0026#39At that point she made the harrowing decision to have her right leg amputated to stop the pain, even though she was told there was no guarantee it would work. The NHS refused to carry out the operation on the grounds that it was not the recommended treatment for CRPS and that she could still be in pain afterwards. But other surgeons said there was a chance the operation would take away her pain.Miss Moore said that since the operation she had never looked back, had lost 4 st and was fitter than before. “Having my leg amputated was the best decision I’ve ever made,” she said. “The things I have achieved I would never have without this operation.

You can buy it from selfridges.comIt is estimated that the UK throws away around 2.5bn disposable coffee cups a year and almost all are incinerated, exported or sent to landfill because their plastic lining makes them expensive to recycle. The new Latte Levy in the UK means there will now be a 25p charge on every disposable coffee cup bought by consumers. Pret A Manger announced that it will double its discount to 50p in an effort to reduce waste. By swapping to a reusable cup you will be able to help cut the cost of disposable coffee cups.

You can purchase them from Bali Boo on Amazon.co.uk for £13.99.“The main issue is that effectively the price per tonne to the waste management companies received for cups has meant it hasn’t been economic for them to take the cups to the paper mills – there hasn’t been enough profit it in it  for them,” he said.“We realised that was actually the hurdle we had to overcome if we were going to cut through this, and as the market leader we felt we should.”To address the shortfall, Costa Coffee has agreed to pay an additional £75 per tonne to waste management companies, making it economically viable to transport cups to the paper mill.In doing so, it predicts the number of cups recycled at the UK’s facilities will rise from 14 million cups to 100 million this year.UK set to throw away a third more disposable cupsThe company has entered into a partnership with five national waste collectors – Veolia, Biffa, Suez, Grundon and First Mile – that between them cover public spaces across the UK including hospitals, universities and transport hubs.The coffee giant is also working with paper mills to ensure their products are recycled effectively. James Cropper, for example, has plans to “upcycle” 500 million cups a year to create plastic-free packaging.“We’ve developed these processes over a number of years because we recognise the need for brands to consider their packaging design and explore plastic-free alternatives,” said Phil Wild, chief executive officer at James Cropper.By building more partnerships with waste contractors in every region, Costa intends to hit its half a billion mark within two years.With one report predicting the number of takeaway drink cups thrown away in the UK is set to rise by a third by 2030, and the government recently failing to back a “latte levy” to discourage cup use, it falls to businesses to act on the huge amount of waste from their products.Commenting on the announcement Environment Minister Therese Coffey, said: “Congratulations Costa on taking this significant step to help coffee lovers do the right thing and increase recycling. We all have a responsibility to our environment and this is a significant step by a British business which should dramatically increase the number of disposable coffee cups we recycle in this country.“We want to help companies become plastic free and through our 25 Year Environment Plan we are putting in place the ambitions to encourage all of us to play our part in ending the scourge of plastic waste in our natural environment.”    What do people think of Starbucks charging 5p for coffee cups?“We’re hoping that via this announcement our other competitors will come on board with us as well – we can’t see why they wouldn’t,” said Mr Paul.Concern about plastic waste,and the harm it is causing to the marine environment in particular, has led to many communities up and down the UK attempting to eradicate single-use plastics such as disposable coffee cups altogether.As awareness has grown among the public, companies have felt the pressure to act on their disposable coffee cup waste.  The Independent’s Cut the Cup Waste campaign has found that the majority of the British public would support a 25p charge on disposable coffee cups, investigated the use of china cups in major coffee chains and featured calls on businesses and government to take responsibility for their waste.“What the campaigns have done is increase customer focus on this area – quite rightly – and it has actually been helpful for us because it has enabled us to move quicker with some of the waste management firms than we would have done otherwise,” said Mr Paul.“It’s helping us do the right thing.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Job prospects and and a disillusionment with politics are among the issues still pushing many millennials, like generations before them, to move away. Except now, things are supposed to be different. Brexit has the potential to undermine the Good Friday AgreementTwenty years ago, on 10 April 1998, peace came to Northern Ireland. After 30 years of brutal sectarian conflict, in which more than 3,600 people were killed, political groups agreed to reject violence and work together to solve problems democratically. It was called the Good Friday Agreement. A devolved assembly would be established for both sides to govern together and while unionists were assured of their British identity, a united Ireland was acknowledged as a legitimate political goal for republicans. Some 71 per cent of people in Northern Ireland voted to accept the agreement in a referendum, with the DUP being the only party to reject it. David Trimble and John Hume were pictured on stage with Bono after brokering the Good Friday Agreement (AFPGetty)The years that followed saw continued political instability and fringe paramilitary activity but largely, the deal held. By 2003, voting patterns in Northern Ireland shifted considerably. While Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader David Trimble and Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader John Hume had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts in 1998, their parties were gradually sidelined.Instead, the electorate moved towards more hardline options. The DUP, led by the formidable Rev Ian Paisley, with their staunch Presbyterian values, and unwavering loyalty to Britain overtook the UUP and Sinn Fein, the unapologetically republican party with former IRA prisoners among its ranks, effectively replaced the SDLP.And yet, they managed the unthinkable. In 2008, Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness led the two parties into power sharing for the first time, and were seen not just working together, but laughing together.But while violence faded from the streets, a cultural battleground began to open up politically – not just over the very narrative of the Troubles, but over parading, flags and language, with the DUP fighting for a retention of all things British, while Sinn Fein vouched for Irish culture to be given the equal weighting it was promised in the agreement. Naomi Long is the leader of Alliance, a small, centre ground party with members from both communities. She says even at the height of the conflict, politics was not as starkly ided as it is now.“I think there has been a reliance on the use of the politics of fear, and using that as a rather lazy means to garner votes in elections,” she explains. “The big political parties essentially ask people to vote for them to keep other people out, rather than as a positive expression of what their ambitions and aspirations for the future might be.”Power sharing has now been suspended at Stormont in Belfast since January 2017 (Getty)But whether the parties are setting the agenda from their offices at Stormont, or whether they are merely responding to the wishes of the people on the street, both the DUP and Sinn Fein are totally in step with their ever hardening bases.One of the best litmus tests is The Nolan Show, “the biggest show in the country” broadcast every morning on BBC Radio Ulster. The impassioned, angry, and often downright bigoted views expressed by callers have made the very name of the show synonymous with sounding off. A recent standoff heard a unionist man refuse to call Sinn Fein’s Mairtín O Muilleoir by his Irish name, because a previous republican caller refused to even call the country “Northern Ireland”. As they argued among themselves, Stephen Nolan spoke for many listeners when he muttered, “This is pathetic.”The DUP have found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights (PA)It would be pessimistic to suggest that the show’s more colourful callers are representative of Northern Ireland as a whole, but it would be a blatant dismissal of the region’s political stalemate to suggest it is not. Just as the callers cannot agree, increasingly, Sinn Fein and the DUP can’t either.On 9 January last year, Martin McGuinness resigned his position as deputy first minister over a political scandal that implicated DUP leader Arlene Foster – although she denies any wrongdoing. Declaring it “the right time to call a halt to the DUP’s arrogance”, Northern Ireland’s mandatory power sharing coalition meant his resignation also removed Foster from her position as first minister, collapsing the assembly.His statement, an astonishing swansong delivered two months before his death, also laid out a litany of claims against the DUP. After 10 years of working together, McGuinness concluded that, “the equality, mutual respect and all-Ireland approaches enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement have never been fully embraced by the DUP.”Martin McGuinness resigned in protest against the handling of a botched energy scheme (Getty)This brought everything crashing down, and in the election which followed, both the DUP and Sinn Fein increased their popular vote, but one side had clearly benefited. Unionism lost its overall majority for the first time ever, and Sinn Fein were suddenly just a hair’s breadth behind their rivals.To their detriment, the DUP have also found themselves on the unfashionable side of social issues that Sinn Fein have championed, including LGBT rights and abortion reform. The general election of June 2017 brought this to the attention of the British mainstream after their confidence and supply agreement with Theresa May’s Conservatives. Talks to restore power sharing remain unresolved, with Sinn Fein requests for parity with the rest of the UK on language rights and marriage equality being rejected by the DUP. Arlene Foster has been criticised for saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland (Getty)Michelle Gildernew was part of the first Sinn Fein delegation ever received at Downing Street by Tony Blair in 1997 and is now a Westminster MP. She doesn’t feel her party is asking for anything more than what people are entitled to.“We’re looking at rights that people have across these islands,” she says, “whether that’s legacy rights, rights for LGBT citizens, for Irish, Scots, Welsh language speakers. There are rights for people everywhere across these islands, except for the six counties. I think that is a completely unacceptable situation. I’m raising three children here and I want them to have the same rights as their friends and neighbours, wherever they are.”Talk to the average person on the street in Northern Ireland and they’ll criticise politicians, for putting cultural issues and minority rights ahead of health, housing and education – budgets for which have all been squeezed during the impasse. But every election returns the same reality. People vote in huge numbers for the DUP and Sinn Fein to hold their corners.Former Irish taoiseach Bertie Ahern signed the Good Friday Agreement alongside Tony Blair, and maintains that bigger hurdles were overcome then. The restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement signed by Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, is vital (PA)“I think everybody has to compromise,” he tells me. “If you cast your mind back 20 years ago we were dealing with the big issues of prisoners’ release, decommissioning, a new criminal justice system – they were major issues. Now I don’t want to trivialise the issues now and say they’re minor, but they’re certainly not at the magnitude of what we had to crack in 1998.”The fundamental problem is that while the war is over, unionists and republicans remain locked in a psychological battle for the very soul of Northern Ireland. Is its future still within the United Kingdom, or are we moving towards a united Ireland? While the Good Friday Agreement acknowledged that Northern Ireland would remain a part of the UK, it was also agreed that when a majority of people in the north and the south of Ireland wanted to reunify, a referendum could be held, and the result would be honoured. Republicans saw this as a starting gun for their goal of reunification, and while this angered some unionists, most seemed confident it wasn’t of immediate concern – something leaders within the DUP and the UUP have felt the need to reiterate in recent weeks, with diminishing certainty.Murals in Belfast serve as a reminder of Northern Ireland’s violent past (Getty)For most of the past two decades, the public discourse has maintained that republicans cannot hope to win over a majority for a united Ireland because most centre ground voters are too well off in the UK – including many nationalists who are quietly accepting of the situation. But now that seems about to change.If Brexit stunned the country, it shook Northern Ireland to its core, where 56 per cent of people voted to remain. The European Union served not just as a guarantor for the Good Friday Agreement, but accommodated a kind of harmonisation across Ireland that contented many nationalists. An invisible border allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united.Gildernew’s Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency shares a great length of that border with four counties of the Irish Republic.“I cross it probably every day,” she says. “People cross it for work, for business, for school, for caring responsibilities, to visit family, even just to walk the dog. We’ve spent decades trying to remove the border, not just the physical infrastructure, but in people’s hearts and minds, and any changes to that will be resisted by the communities on either side of it.”The invisible border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland allows people to move, live and work across the island, as if it were indeed united (Getty)Indeed, the prospect of a border returning has also mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand, with taoiseach Leo Varadkar claiming that “no Irish government will ever again leave Northern nationalists and Northern Ireland behind”.It’s increasingly clear that by campaigning for a patriotic cause they probably never believed would have consequences, the DUP shot unionism in the foot. Suddenly, Sinn Fein were handed a card to play which made a united Ireland a plausible, realistic and economically sensible option. It would be lazy to assume that the 56 per cent who voted remain would automatically want to remain within the EU by means of a united Ireland, but it has certainly made the option much more appealing. In the past two weeks, Sinn Fein vice president Michelle O’Neill has called for a unity referendum to be held within five years, while Arlene Foster was criticised after saying she would leave the country in the event of a united Ireland. The DUP were asked to provide comment for this feature, but neglected to put anyone forward.Alex Kane is a former communications director for the UUP and believes there are strong arguments to be made for staying within the UK.“Even if there was a referendum, I’m not convinced unionism would lose it at this point,” he says. “But I think there are more challenges for unionists now than there have been in my lifetime. I think it’s an existential challenge for unionism.”Michelle O’Neill (left) wants a unity referendum to be held within five years (Getty)Kevin Meagher is the author of A United Ireland: Why Unification Is Inevitable and How It Will Come About. He believes it could happen by 2022, as a result of a demographic shift in nationalism’s favour, and quite possibly, Jeremy Corbyn in 10 Downing Street. He warns that the vote could be won despite the apparent polarisation of Northern Irish politics.“An agreed Ireland is not a precondition for a united Ireland,” he stresses, “and what I’ve been saying to British politicians is if you think you can kick the can down the road until everybody gets on and everything is forgotten, you’re not going to have that option. The reality is, by 2022 you could have an electoral majority who want a united Ireland, and you’re going to have to facilitate that.”The ultimate irony is that by so flagrantly risking the interests of Northern Ireland to carry out the will of Little Englanders, the Conservatives have put Irish reunification further up the agenda than Sinn Fein ever could have done alone. Unionists may see this as their worst nightmare, but Meagher – a former special adviser in the Northern Ireland Office – believes it wouldn’t bother the British government much at all.“If presented with a way out that was reasonable and effective for British ministers of either party, frankly they would have had to take an option of Irish unity 20, 30, 40 years ago. It’s been looming in British politics that this is the direction of travel.”Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland (Getty)As government predictions show the GDP of Northern Ireland would be reduced by 12 per cent under a no deal Brexit, economic safety within the UK is no longer a certainty. The Irish economy, on the other hand, is growing three times faster than any other European country. The question now shifts from whether people want to risk their livelihood by joining a united Ireland, to whether people can actually afford to stay in the UK.As it currently stands, Theresa May is promising no return to a hard border in Ireland, which is pleasing nationalists, republicans, the Irish government and the EU. She is also promising no border down the Irish Sea, to keep the DUP happy. And yet, she is carrying out the will of a British majority, whose primary concern in voting for Brexit was immigration Loughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandLoughs, Brexit and fishermen in Northern IrelandEnda Craig, a member of the Loughs Agency Advisory Forum, holds a map of Lough Foyle in Moville, IrelandOyster farmer William Lynch puts on his wellington boots on his oyster farm on Lough Foyle in Culmore, Northern IrelandWomen walk along the shores of Carlingford Lough with Northern Ireland seen across the lough in CarlingfordA poster hanging on a wall of a house reads: No to the ferry, referring to a proposed new car ferry that would run from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland through Carlingford Lough in GreencastleSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick (L) and boat owner Brian Cunningham navigate out of Warrenpoint harbour into Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandA woman with flowers walks past an old fuel station in Carlingford, IrelandA boat is seen at sunset on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandA mandries off after swimming in Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandA derelict house is seen on the shore of Carlingford Lough in Omeath, IrelandSkipper Shay Fitzpatrick dredges mussels from Carlingford Lough in Warrenpoint, Northern IrelandBagged-up farmed oysters at a cleaning facility to get them ready for overseas shipping in Moville, IrelandA man walks his dog in matching hi-vis outfits on Carlingford Lough in Greenore, IrelandCarlingford Lough and in the distance Northern Ireland are seen at sunset from Omeath, IrelandA sign that reads: \u0027In 1771 nothing happened here\u0027 is seen on the shores of Carlingford Lough in Carlingford, Ireland. Will they really stand for the kind of soft or non-existent border the prime minister is promising Ireland? Someone, somewhere down the line, is going to be betrayed.Deputy leader of the SDLP Nichola Mallon says it’s now time for May to deliver solutions of substance, not just empty rhetoric.“This for us is not an orange and green issue, it’s not about the constitutional question on the island, this is about ensuring we have the best deal for people across the island, and we believe this is best served by Northern Ireland remaining in the customs union and the single market,” she says.The prospect of a hard border returning has mobilised politicians in the south to take a stand (AFPGetty)So Northern Ireland is waiting for a solution on the border, but also for a political landscape that works for everybody. Surely, after two decades, that isn’t too much to ask?“I thought within 20 years, something is bound to be different other than the fact we’re not shooting each other,” Alex Kane says, “and that’s good, but it’s not enough. Not killing each other is normal, but also normal is parties making decisions, going into government together, having choices. We don’t seem any closer to that.”I\u0027m ashamed of the state of the world, says PopeClinton says Good Friday Agreement anniversary is an chance for peaceThreat of \u0027serious trouble\u0027 in Northern IrelandBut the restoration of power sharing, as ingrained in the Good Friday Agreement, is a must. It may require unpalatable concessions from both sides, but a Stormont assembly is essential, whether you want to remain in a UK of devolved governments, or – as Bertie Ahern points out – if you are aiming for that referendum on Irish unity.“You have to have stable institutions and sustainable development going forward before you do that,” he believes. “The clause to have referendums is part of the Good Friday Agreement, so it doesn’t seem logical in my view to be talking about a referendum when you don’t even have the agreement fully in place.”The evidence suggests that the winds of change are blowing in favour of Northern Ireland’s nationalists, but the hard work of honouring the Good Friday Agreement is crucial to achieving a new Ireland of equals for all.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Colin Drury delves into the inside story of the battle to save 20,000 trees being felled in a single cityJenny Hockey still shivers when she remembers the moment, almost 18 months ago, she was woken by police hammering at her door. It was 5am. When she looked outside, she momentarily wondered if a terror incident was unfolding.“It was that kind of scene,” the 71-year-old says. “Multiple cars, officers swarming everywhere, flashing lights. We had no idea what was happening.”It was 17 November 2016 and, under the cover of darkness, officers from South Yorkshire Police had descended on Sheffield’s Rustlings Road, one of the city’s most sought-after addresses. Cordoning off the street and banging on doors, they ordered residents to get dressed and move their vehicles or have them towed away. Within the hour, Hockey, a retired sociology professor, would become one of three neighbours arrested and locked up for eight hours.227-year-old tree planted by George Washington pulled down by windBut this dramatic pre-dawn raid – described by Nick Clegg, then the local MP, as like something “you’d expect in Putin’s Russia” – was not carried out in search of terrorists or criminals.Rather, it was in support of council contractors hired to chop down eight street trees, which residents had spent more than a year petitioning to save.Amid the confusion, Hockey and two others – including another woman in her seventies – attempted to stand under one of these century-old limes, only to be detained. All charges were later dropped.“We wanted to protect something we loved,” she says. “And our right to do that – our democratic right – was taken away, really, by state force. It was so horrible and disempowering.”Indeed, by the time the trio were freed, the trees which had always overlooked their homes were no more.Contractors cut down the final tree in Rustlings Road (PA)Yet a bigger battle was just beginning: one which has since spread across the city, seen mass protests and riot police on suburban streets, and ultimately revealed an astonishing secret plan – hidden within a £2.2bn PFI contract – to cut down almost 20,000 street trees…Sheffield has long boasted of being Europe’s greenest city – in part because a third of it sits in the Peak District. But it is also due to the sheer number of trees that line the roads. Some 36,000 of them arch over highways and footpaths.But around 2015, talk of what the Woodland Trust called a “tree massacre” started to emerge.Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a highways improvement scheme  (PA)The eight limes in Rustlings Road were not the only ones marked for the chainsaw. Under then-redacted clauses in a £2.2bn contract, Sheffield’s Labour council had agreed for 17,500 street trees to be axed as part of a vast highways improvement scheme being undertaken by the infrastructure giant Amey.Company and council both said – and still say – such felling was necessary. Targeted trees, they argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing irreparable damage to roads and footpaths. Every one taken down, they added, was being substituted with a younger sapling: “We assess every single tree and only replace them as a last resort,” says Darren Butt, account director with Amey, today.Targeted trees, the council argued, were either dying, dangerous or had roots causing damage to roads and footpathsYet, as this felling increased, questions started to be asked. There was shock when two cherries commemorating Second World War heroes disappeared one day. At Christmas, a row decorated with charity festive lights were hacked back – with fellers cutting through wires and all.A feeling spread that perfectly healthy and safe trees were being chopped unnecessarily. A suspicion grew that the policy was actually about increasing Amey’s profit margins. Over the length of the company’s 25-year highway maintenance obligations, so ran the theory, a newly planted sapling is far cheaper to look after than older, larger arboreta.“People were going to work in the morning and coming home to entirely different-looking streets,” says Paul Selby, a city resident and leading member of Sheffield Tree Action Groups, known as Stag. “It was ecological destruction carried out, in secret, by a multinational company with the explicit support of the local authority and the police.“And people were angry. These trees were part of their lives and they didn’t want them taking. These weren’t anarchists or hardline activists from other towns. They’re Sheffielders furious they hadn’t been given a voice in what was happening in their streets. So they came out and fought to be heard.”Almost 6,000 trees have been chopped down. But in the face of overwhelming and increasingly nationalised pressure, a pause on felling was announced last week.Sheffield City Council has put this down to the “dangerous tactics” of protestors. Yet the support in favour of Stag – both within the city and from names including Jeremy Corbyn, Michael Gove, Ken Loach and Jarvis Cocker – probably had something to do with it too.Hopes are now high the whole policy can be reconsidered. “We don’t take anything for granted,” says Selby, a civil servant with the Department for Work and Pensions. “But, after so long fighting, surely dialogue is now the sensible way forward.”Tensions rose, with fellers and protestors accusing each other of intimidationCertainly, it has been a troubled road to here: the irony perhaps being that this all started with a real city victory.In 2012 the government handed Sheffield £1.2bn to improve its roads, an economic godsend for a place locals had taken to calling Pothole City. Amey – a subsidiary of the Spanish company Ferrovial – won the work contract, promising to upgrade and maintain every highway, pavement, bridge, subway and street light for 25 years.“This is work that is good for everyone living here,” says Paul Billington, director of culture and environment with the city council. “It is already bringing investment and opportunities back into the city because it is making our infrastructure world-class.”Replacing damaging or dying trees, he argues, is key to that success continuing. Doing it now, he adds, is important because, as a 2007 survey showed, a large majority of trees are so old that to delay action would store problems for future generations.At a picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up, the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets“No one disagrees that dying or damaging trees should be looked at – if they really do fall into those categories,” says Alison Teal, a Green Party councillor in the city. “But this went beyond that. We still didn’t know how many were due to come down but everywhere you looked, these magnificent trees were disappearing.”Demonstrations were civil enough to start with. People at home would spot Amey vans and go out to stand under targeted trees so they couldn’t be axed. Others started taking the bus to work, leaving their cars blocking access to endangered arboreta.Cups of tea were offered while people stood about. They debated the merits of the trees: their beauty, the environmental benefits, the wildlife. Occasionally, they talked about their favourite. An endangered elm in the Nether Edge area ended up being shortlisted for the 2016 England Tree Of The Year Award.Yet things hardened after the Rustlings Road raid (“In hindsight, it was poorly handled,” says Darren Butt). While many still supported the replacement scheme, opinion started to harden in favour of the so-called tree-huggers. Stag membership doubled within the month.“At that point people were really realising this isn’t just about trees, it’s about democracy and our right to a say on what happens in our streets,” says Teal, a psychologist by trade.Demonstrations became feistier. Stumps of trees already cut were painted blood red as a mark of anger. Stag supporters – now numbering in their thousands – took to organising daily spotter patrols and flying pickets.“When someone saw an Amey van near an endangered tree, they put a message in a WhatsApp group or online, and whoever was available would go and protect that tree,” says Teal.UK news in picturesUK news in picturesPrime Minister Theresa May hosts a meeting with leaders and representatives of Caribbean countries, at 10 Downing Street on the sidelines of the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting.Aneira Thomas, the first baby to be born on the NHS, addresses the Unison Health Conference at the Brighton CentreSir Patrick Stewart addresses the crowd during the People\u0027s Vote campaign launch on Brexit at the Electric Ballroom in Camden Town.

None were ever charged. At another picket last month, a specialist police protest removal unit turned up. It was the first time it had ever been deployed on South Yorkshire’s streets.Arrest numbers grew – yet there were vaguely comedic elements to many. A 57-year-old woman was detained after blowing a pink trumpet, while a retired couple – Dr John and Sue Unwin – found themselves being questioned by CID officers (and later cleared) about the suspected poisoning of a cup of tea they gave a feller.“It sounds like the plot from an Agatha Christie novel,” Dr Unwin told the Daily Mail.One 73-year-old was detained for intimidation. Alan Simpson, a retired firefighter and great-grandfather, says: “I’ve never been in trouble in my life and was there with my wife. I don’t think I could have cut a less intimidating figure if I tried.” His charge, too, has been dropped.“If it wasn’t so serious,” says James Whitworth, cartoonist on local newspaper The Star, “it would be farcical, and I mean that literally: there is enough material here to make an actual farce.“As a cartoonist, it’s a dream because the whole thing is so ridiculous. You think you can’t possibly say anymore on the issue – and then they arrest a woman for blowing a plastic trumpet. But as a city resident: I’m pretty neutral but, really, maybe leave our trees alone?”Local newspaper cartoonist James Whitworth’s take on the Sheffield tree massacre (James Whitworth)As news of the ongoing demonstrations spread, meanwhile, concern grew it was damaging the city’s reputation. When Sheffield was left off The Sunday Times Best Places to Live list this year, authorities blamed the campaigners: “it is regrettable the increasingly extreme actions of a small number of protestors is having this impact,” a council spokesperson declared.Demonstrators themselves were not above ridiculous assertions either: at a packed council meeting, one compared Amey’s workers to Nazi guards, just doing their jobs.Lavender and tea tree oils could be giving boys breasts, study warnsChina reassigns 60,000 troops to plant trees in bid to fight pollutionHow the Japanese fought suicide in the ‘Sea of Trees’For now, however, the potential turning point arguably came in March when a freedom of information request, asked by Paul Selby, forced the council to reveal it had indeed asked for 17,500 trees to be chopped down. The figure was so astonishing all three city MPs – all Labour – called for a rethink.In a disastrous interview on local radio, council cabinet member for environment Bryan Lodge – who declined to be interviewed for this piece – denied the figure was a target but could not explain what it actually was. Days later the suspension of felling was announced.What happens next is the question the city is asking itself.“We’ve already lost 6,000 trees,” says Selby. “Of course, there are some that should come down if they really are dying or doing irreversible damage to footpaths. But all other solutions should be sought first. Trees are a sign of a civilised city. We should be doing everything we can to save them.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The committee is minded to issue a formal summons\u0027The suspended boss of Cambridge Analytica is facing an official summons after refusing to appear before a committee of MPs investigating the Facebook data breach scandal.The committee’s chair reacted angrily after Alexander Nix claimed an investigation by the information commissioner meant the controversy was sub judice.Damian Collins said: “We have taken advice and he is not charged with any criminal offence and there are no active legal proceedings.“There is therefore no legal reason why Mr Nix cannot appear. The committee is minded to issue a formal summons for him to appear on a named day in the very near future.”The refusal came as the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee’s inquiry into the scandal was told that the misuse of voters’ personal data was “rife” during the Brexit campaign.A former Cambridge Analytica employee alleged that the group Leave.EU may have also used data from the insurance businesses run by its funder Arron Banks, to target potential Brexit supporters.It may also have broken electoral law because work was done by Cambridge Analytica that was not paid for and because data from UK citizens appeared to have been processed abroad, Brittany Kaiser said.In written evidence, Ms Kaiser, Cambridge Analytica’s former director of programme development, said: “I now think that there is reason to believe that misuse of data was rife amongst the businesses and campaigns of Arron Banks.“If the personal data of UK citizens who just wanted to buy car insurance was used by GoSkippy and Eldon Insurance for political purposes, as may have been the case, people clearly did not opt in for their data to be used in this way by Leave.EU.Brexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUBrexit talks: Top issues facing UK on leaving EUA key point in the negotiations remains Britain\u0027s access to, or withdrawal from, the EU customs union. Since the referendum there has been hot debate over the meaning of Brexit: would it entail a full withdrawal from the existing agreement, known as hard Brexit, or the soft version in which we would remain part of a common customs area for most goods, as Turkey does?\u0026#13Though progress was made last year, there has still been no solid agreement on whether there should be a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\u0026#13Despite protests from a small number of Conservative MPs, the Government and the EU are largely in agreement that a transitional period is needed after Brexit.\u0026#13The Prime Minister has promised EU citizens already living in the UK the right to live and work here after Brexit, but the rights of those who arrive after Brexit day remains unclear.\u0026#13Despite this being a key issue in negotiations, the Government has yet to lay out exactly what it wants from a trade deal with the EU.\u0026#13The Government has already begun trying to woo foreign leaders into prospective trade agreements, with various high profile state visits to China, India and Canada for May, and the now infamous invitation to US President Donald Trump to visit London.\u0026#13Banks in the UK will be hit hard regardless of the Brexit outcome. The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.\u0026#13“I have similar concerns about whether Ukip members consented to the use of their data.”Mr Nix was asked to make a second appearance before the fake news inquiry after telling it, in February, that Cambridge Analytica did not have or use Facebook data.It was then revealed that the personal information of at least 87 million people was harvested from Facebook by a company with a deal to share it with the London-based communications firm.Mr Collins demanded Mr Nix, who was suspended from his role as chief executive, return to be quizzed on “a number of inconsistencies in your evidence to us”.Brexit: Commonwealth trade plans mocked as a ‘fool’s errand’ by MPWindrush scandal ‘deeply worrying’ for EU citizens, says VerhofstadtHow Brexit is set to cause chaos at Europe’s ports‘People’s Vote’ campaign group calls for referendum on Brexit dealHe warned that “giving false statements to a select committee is a very serious matter” and urged Mr Nix to “explain” his comments.The information commissioner said: “We have written to Mr Nix to invite him to be interviewed by our investigators. Our investigation is looking at whether criminal and civil offences have been committed under the Data Protection Act.”In her evidence, Ms Kaiser said she believed the number of people whose data was harvested from Facebook was “much greater” than the 87 million acknowledged.And she claimed Cambridge Analytica, which she left in 2012, had created several of its own Facebook quizzes designed to harvest data from iniduals.They included a “sex compass” quiz, which would tell Facebook users what their “personal preferences” were, and a “music personality” quiz.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

russia","story":"International chemical weapons inspectors\u0026nbspfinally set to visit\u0026nbspsite of the\u0026nbspalleged attack in DoumaTheresa May has won a second symbolic vote on her decision to launch airstrikes after another day of fraught parliamentary debate on Syria.The prime minister’s advisers believe the result shows she has successfully navigated difficulties arising from her move to push ahead with a military operation without first consulting MPs.But Jeremy Corbyn used the debate to demand that the House of Commons “take back our control” of decisions to launch any military action, with a new “War Powers Act”.Theresa May says ‘element of surprise’ was crucial in Syria bombingThe development came as inspectors were set to finally make it to the site of the alleged Douma chemical weapons attack on Wednesday, with Ms May accusing Moscow of preventing the scientists from doing their work.Ahead of the Commons vote on Syria, Ms May told MPs that coming to parliament before undertaking military action would “compromise the effectiveness of our operations and safety of British servicemen and women”.She attacked the suggestion of a War Powers Act, claiming it would remove “vital flexibility” from situations which are “by definition unpredictable”.She went on: “Making it unlawful for Her Majesty’s Government to undertake any such military intervention without a vote would seriously compromise our national security, our national interests, and the lives of British citizens at home and abroad.Syria bombing: EU ‘understands’ recent airstrikes but calls for ‘urgent’ resumption of peace talks“And, for as long as I’m prime minister, that will never be allowed to happen.”She concluded by saying that after two days of debate no one could doubt her commitment to be held accountable by parliament, and also that the tone of the debate had been supportive to the strikes.Chemical weapons inspectors have entered Douma, Syrian media says‘Very likely’ evidence disappearing from Douma site, France saysCorbyn leads debate in Parliament on Syria strikes- as it happenedMay defends Syria air strikes amid criticism over lack of voteTrump halts plans for new sanctions on Russia If May wants to help Syria she should accept more refugeesA vote related to the Syria action was already won by the government on Monday, though it was not on a substantive motion – one that explicitly seeks to approve the action or not.The motion of Tuesday’s vote, which stated the Commons has “considered parliament’s rights in relation to the approval of military action by British forces”, was also neutral in tone.But Mr Corbyn called on his own MPs to vote against it, despite Labour having called the debate, to show opposition over how they believe the government sidelined parliament in relation to the military action.Before the motion was passed by 317 to 256, Mr Corbyn’s speech was met with bad tempered heckling from Tory MPs, who consistently tried to intervene while the Labour leader was talking.Kenneth Clarke criticises Theresa May for failure to consult parliament over Syria bombingSpeaker John Bercow gave warnings to Conservative backbenchers such as Alec Shelbrooke and Mark Harper during the course of the debate.Outlining his proposed War Powers Act, the Labour leader said it was for the Commons “to take matters into its own hands and take back our control”.He added: “There’s no more serious issue in decisions made by parliament on matters of war and peace, and the government taking planned military action.“That convention was established in 2003, it was enshrined in Cabinet in 2011, and the then the foreign secretary gave every indication that he supported the principle of parliamentary scrutiny and parliamentary approval of such a major step.“I’ve outlined the caveats that are there in a case of overriding emergency, but I do think it is very important that the House of Commons, as one of the oldest parliaments in the world, holds the government to account.”Earlier in the day the prime minister accused Moscow of preventing inspectors for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) from reaching Douma.Russian officials at OPCW headquarters in The Hague later said arrangements were being made for the inspectors to travel to the site on Wednesday.Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has flatly denied that Russia had “tampered” with the evidence, and insisted there is no proof that chemical weapons had even been used in Douma.Douma chemical attack: Syria war in picturesDouma chemical

dangerous development”.Speaking at a press conference in Dublin, Yury Filatov suggested the strikes were intended to impede the investigation so nobody would know the truth, adding that experts have not yet found any traces of chlorine or any other toxic agents.“As far as we can see there was no attack,” he said. “Not a single local resident was able to confirm that a chemical attack had actually taken place.”Mr Filatov said the suspected chemical attack had “definitely been staged”, and that the images had been “fabricated”.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They said if Florida were a separate country, it would be the world’s 26th largest carbon polluter.“The Sunshine State gets less than one per cent of its energy from solar power,” said Oscar Psychas, 20, from Gainesville, the oldest of the plaintiffs.Speaking at a press conference in the state’s capital, Tallahassee, he added: “Last spring I walked to 280 miles from my home in Gainesville to Tallahassee to demand our state’s leaders protect our wild places. During my walk I saw climate change firsthand during the hottest spring ever recorded in Florida and forests dying from sea level rise along the Gulf Coast. “I’m back in Tallahassee today because I’ve seen that when our leaders destroy a stable climate, everything we care about — our wild places, our communities, our basic rights to life, liberty, and property – is endangered.”Security of supply, jobs and climate change: Jacinda Ahern lays out why she is banning further oil exploration in New ZealandGuy Burns, who is serving as lead counsel for the young plaintiffs said that Florida had an amazing opportunity to make use of its renewable energy sources, that included solar, wave and wind. Instead, he claimed the state government had promoted the use of fossil fuels. “It is the responsibility of the state to uphold the constitution, and these young people have a fundamental right to a stable climate system,” he said.The civil lawsuit is not seeking financial damages. Rather, it wants the court to order a science-based climate recovery plan and for the state government to acknowledge climate change is real and that climate change impacts are harming the youth plaintiffs. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesEuropean lawmakers raise placards reading Stop the War in Syria in protest against airstrikes launched by the US, Britain and France in Syria last week criticizing the legitimacy of the operation, as French President Emmanuel Macron delivers his speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg.

Last week he left the hospital for a weekend to visit his family in Brittany.“If I hadn’t accepted this new face it would have been terrible,” he told AFP news agency. ”It’s a question of identity... But here we are, it’s good, it’s me.”He added: “He never complained. We felt we were dealing with someone exceptional.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?
