I am disappointed in her actions to say the least,\u0027 wrote Gilbert.\u0027This is incredibly sad and difficult for all of us, as we\u0027ve created a show that we believe in, are proud of, and that audiences love— one that is separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member.\u0027\u0027Wow! unreal,\u0027 wrote Barr, who had confessed in earlier interviews to the difficult job Gilbert had of trying to rein in her impulse to tweet offensive comments.However, she later followed up, tweeting: \u0027No, I understand her position and why she said what she said. i forgive her. It just shocked me a bit, but I indeed f***ed up.\u0027She reiterated this soon after when a follower criticized Gilbert, saying: \u0027She\u0027s distancing herself from me and my tweet-she has to.\u0027 Gilbert\u0027s on-screen brother did not get off so easy. Michael Fishman, who played D.J.

I have always lived and taught my children to be inclusive. I believe our show strived to embrace different backgrounds and opinions, through open dialogue.\u0027Barr was none too happy with that statement and fired back on Twitter: \u0027I created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it. ME. You throw me under the bus. nice!\u0027Fishman responded, stating: \u0027You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that.\u0027Barr fired back: \u0027Please leave me alone, thanks.\u0027  Barr seemed to have made amends with both Gilbert and Fishman after a few days however, writing:  \u0027To michael fishman and sara gilbert: I forgive u both, love u both, just wish u could have called me personally 2 talk rather than do it in a public arena. I understand, tho.

When the crescent moon is seen, Eid can begin.Considered one of the most important holidays of the Islamic calendar, Eid has its own particular set of prayers that can only be recited in congregation and often called out in parks, community centres or mosques called the Salat al-Eid.          Iranian men perform the Eid prayers at Tehran University to mark on the religious festivalWhen is Eid al Fitr 2018?Due to the dates of Ramadan varying from one year to another on the Gregorian calendar, Eid is also on a different day each year because it is determined by the lunar calendar.In 2018, Eid al-Fitr will take place on Friday, June 15 after the crescent moon is seen on the evening of June 14 in Saudi Arabia.The time in Saudi Arabia is three hours later than Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and at present, there is a two hour difference between the UK and Riyadh because of British Summer Time (BST).This means that as sunset is predicted for 6.43pm this evening, this would be 4:43pm in Britain. But as astronomers have predicted that the moon will not be visible until the next day, Eid al-Fitr will officially begin on Friday.Saudi Arabia’s Supreme Court has requested for Muslims to keep an eye out for the crescent moon and report it to authorities as many Islamic scholars insist on it being visible with the naked eye.          Pakistani worshippers hold prayers for Eid in the Lahore King\u0027s Mosque for the religious festivalHow to celebrate Eid in the UKEvery year, Eid al-Fitr is a big celebration with the Salat al-Eid being recited. Muslims will gather at mosques or open-air areas to pray on the first morning before eating breakfast with their family and friends, their first meal in daylight in over a month.Events will also be held in London’s Trafalgar Square and Birmingham’s Small Heath Park to mark the start of the new month.Muslims also honour Eid by giving to charity and this is referred to as Zakat al-Fitr. Donations will be given to those who are not able to join in the feast and celebrate the breaking of the fast.Boyzone tour: All you need to know about the Thank You \u0026 Goodnight Farewell TourIncredibles 2: Holly Hunter to reprise role as Elastigirl and Helen Parr Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park 2018 performers, time and how to buy tickets revealedWorld Cup 2018: The laws for waving the England flag during the FIFA tournament revealedWorld Cup 2018 Day 2: Google Doodle celebrates Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Uruguay, Iran and Morocco teamsPortugal vs Spain: Kick off time, squads and how to watch on TVWho is Cooke Maroney?

The film follows the prophet Muhammad and the beginning of the Islamic religion in Mecca.The Message depicts when the first Muslims were persecuted and shows their exodus to Medina, after Muhammad was warned of an assassination plot against him before ending with their triumphant return to Mecca.It was made in English with Anthony Quinn and Irene Papas as the main characters and in Arabic, with leading Arab stars Abdullah Gheith and Mouna Wasef from Egypt and Syria respectively.          The Message will be the first Arabic film to get a commercial screening in Riyadh (pictured)Why was The Message banned?The Message was banned in many Muslim-majority countries and in the US, its release in cinemas was suspended after members of an extremist group called the Hanafi movement staged a siege in Washington DC.The group took a number of hostages and killed two people because they thought  Anthony Quinn had played the character of Muhammad in the film. In addition to this, because images of Muhammad are strictly forbidden in Islam, The Message was criticised by conservative Muslims.However, the director Moustapha Akkad was aware of this and produced an epic where Muhammad was never seen or heard. In 2018, more than 40 years after the ban, the Saudi censorship board have cleared it to be screened in 4K in time for Eid celebrations.With both versions being cleared, The Message will be screened by producer Trancas Entertainment and distributor Front Row in the VOX Riyadh Park multiplex in the Saudi capital.

However, the blue tick seems to have disappeared overnight.The controversial tweet may have caused the social network to follow their guidelines, which say that the social media platform will remove verification of anyone that is ‘promoting hate andor violence against, or directly attacking or threatening other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability, or disease among other reasons’.A Twitter spokesperson told the Daily Caller that the company does not comment on inidual accounts for ‘privacy and security reasons’.The ‘Satanic Jew’ tweets are not the first time Farrakhan sparked accusations of anti-semitism.In 1984, he described Judaism as a ‘gutter religion’ and branded supporters of Israel as criminals.He once said that \u0027the Jews don\u0027t like Farrakhan, so they call me Hitler. Well, that\u0027s a good name. Hitler was a very great man\u0027.When speaking about Hezbollah, he said: \u0027They call them terrorists, I call them freedom fighters.\u0027Here is all you need to know about Louis Farrakhan including his wife, children, net worth and Nation of Islam.Who is Louis Farrakhan?Louis Farrakhan is the leader of the Nation of Islam, the American religious group.Born in New York on May 11, 1933 as Louis Eugene Walcott, Farrakhan initially trained as a teacher and a nightclub singer.He won a track scholarship to college in North Carolina and was a talented classical violinist, having first started playing the instrument at the age of 5.In 1955, the religious and political figure Malcolm X persuaded Farrakhan to join the Nation of Islam. Upon joining, Farrakhan dropped his last name and became Louis X. He later became Abdul Haleem Farrakhan, and ultimately Louis Farrakhan.At the beginning of the sixties, a rift formed between Malcolm X and the Nation of Islam leader, Elijah Muhammad.In 1964, Farrakhan criticised Malcolm X in the NOI newspaper saying: ‘The die is set and Malcolm shall not escape... such a man is worthy of death.’The following February, Malcolm X was assassinated and Farrakhan became the NOI spokesman.By the late 1970s, Farrakhan was the head of the Nation of Islam, becoming a highly influential figure on the political landscape during the 1980s.In 1984, Farrakhan supported Jesse Jackson’s presidential bid, and subsequently threatened the Washington Post reporter that reported the story about Jesse Jackson using anti-Semitic language in private.          Farrakhan tweeted a link to his May sermon about Harvey Weinstein that was called \u0027Thoroughly and completely unmasking the Satanic Jew and the Synagogue of Satan\u0027The following year he accepted a $5 million interest-free loan from Muammar Gaddafi.In 1986, Farrakhan sued Ronald Reagan over the Libya sanctions and was banned from entering the UK.In 1991, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which returned again in 1999. He had surgery in 2001 and again in 2007.In 1995, Farrakhan was in the news for organising the ‘Million Man March’ to Washington DC. Hundreds of thousands of black men marched and pledged to remain committed to their families and communities.Louis Farrakhan’s wife and childrenFarrakhan married Betsy Walcott, nee Ross, in 1953 and the couple had nine children. Betsy subsequently changed her name to Khadijah Farrakhan.          Farrakhan organised the 1995 Million Man March as well as the Million Family March in 2000The couple’s oldest son, Louis Farrakhan Jr, was reported dead by the Nation of Islam on June 4, 2018. The statement from the organisation said the 60-year-old had a heart condition and died peacefully in his sleep.What is Louis Farrakhan’s net worth?Louis Farrakhan’s net worth is estimated to be $3 million (£2.2m), according to Celebrity Net Worth.What is the Nation of Islam?The Nation of Islam is a religious and political movement that started in the early 1930s by W.D. Fard Muhammad. Muhammad’s goal was, according to the Nation of Islam website, ‘to teach the downtrodden and defenseless Black people a thorough Knowledge of God and of themselves, and to put them on the road to Self-Independence with a superior culture and higher civilization than they had previously experienced.’Muhammad reportedly disappeared in 1934, and his disciple Elijah Muhammad took over. The organisation rose to prominence when Malcolm Little, later to be Malcolm X, joined, with its numbers swelling to tens of thousands by the 1970s. Muhammad Ali was one of its most famous members.Boyzone tour: All you need to know about the Thank You \u0026 Goodnight Farewell TourIncredibles 2: Holly Hunter to reprise role as Elastigirl and Helen Parr Radio 2 Live in Hyde Park 2018 performers, time and how to buy tickets revealedWorld Cup 2018: The laws for waving the England flag during the FIFA tournament revealedWorld Cup 2018 Day 2: Google Doodle celebrates Spain, Portugal, Egypt, Uruguay, Iran and Morocco teamsPortugal vs Spain: Kick off time, squads and how to watch on TVWho is Cooke Maroney?

The Queen and Meghan dropped in to see schoolchildren at the Storyhouse building in Chester, but at first the youngsters didn\u0027t seem to notice the visitors had arrived          Getting on famously! The Queen and the Duchess of Sussex shared a joke as they watched a ceremony to open the new Mersey Gateway Bridge during their first official engagement togetherWhat is all the more remarkable is that it should have happened so quickly. Since her wedding on May 19, Meghan has seen the Queen only once – at last Saturday\u0027s Trooping the Colour.While she and Harry have been on honeymoon – said to have been to Canada – the Queen has also been away, to Craigowan Lodge at Balmoral.Royal aides had been thinking about a joint visit involving the monarch and Meghan but it was the Queen herself who suggested it should be sooner rather than later.Meghan\u0027s bond with Her Majesty! Harry\u0027s bride shows her...The Queen\u0027s tribute to Grenfell: Her Majesty observes...Share this articleThe Duchess of Cambridge had been married almost a year before being invited to accompany the Queen, at the start of the Diamond Jubilee celebrations in 2012 for a day in Leicester.Some will doubtless wonder if this early invitation for Meghan reflects some sort of favouritism. I understand the decision was taken because it was felt the Duchess of Sussex might need more help to adjust to life inside the Royal Family than the already poised Kate Middleton did.   Growing confidence! Meghan seemed completely at ease as she chatted with the monarch          The Duchess of Sussex looked animated as she chatted during her first official engagement with the Queen          It was felt the Duchess of Sussex might need more help to adjust to life inside the Royal Family than the already poised Kate Middleton (left) did\u0027Remember, unlike Kate she doesn\u0027t have a family to fall back on here,\u0027 said an insider.Indeed, it was noticeable how nervous Meghan appeared as she joined the carriage drive last Saturday.\u0027The Queen\u0027s thinking is simple, she wants to put her at her ease,\u0027 says one of her staff.When the invitation arrived, officials assumed Harry would be included too. Instead, it was made clear this was to be a visit for just the two women.Intriguingly, the programme was not especially designed for Meghan – as it was when the Queen took Kate to Leicester where the two sat through a fashion show. In fact it was deliberately planned as a day of typical royal events that would give Meghan a better grounding in the royal routine.\u0027Nothing too starry, lots of handshaking and meeting of local worthies,\u0027 as one insider puts it.    A sudden gust of wind made Meghan’s decision not to wear a hat on her first official engagement with the Queen rather noticeableSo a message was sent to the Queen’s private office asking what the sovereign intended to wear. The answer included mention of the hat by Rachel Trevor Morgan, which some would have taken as a suggestion for Meghan to do the same.But after some discussion, it was agreed between Buckingham and Kensington Palaces that the duchess would let her brunette locks flow free.                        So much has happened to Meghan since her wedding day: Nottingham Cottage where she and Harry live at Kensington Palace has been redecorated and the couple have spent time at their new country bolthole in Oxfordshire.Nevertheless, it is not difficult to imagine how the duchess must have been feeling as she arrived at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday evening.Whenever the Queen takes the Royal Train there is a protocol to be observed. She dines first at home and then she travels to the station, on this occasion Euston.Meghan, too, had already had supper and the two women were driven together at 10.45pm along with a handful of senior staff. Domestic staff, including footmen, stewards and a dresser, had gone ahead.Once on board the train it is understood the Queen was keen to turn in. She doesn\u0027t like eating late but she did want to ensure that Meghan was comfortable.It must have been an eye-opening experience for the American-born duchess. There are no showers on the train, but full-size baths.   The pair shared a joke during the opening ceremony, showing how a bond is clearly developing between the two women  The Queen looked in great spirits as she began her day out with Harry\u0027s new wife and the pair showed their lighthearted bond as they laughed together during an opening ceremony for the new Mersey Gateway Bridge  The Queen and Meghan were all smiles as they left Chester Town Hall, with both women carrying pretty bouquets of flowers It is thought that Meghan was provided with Prince Philip\u0027s saloon which includes a bedroom, bathroom and sitting room.By the time the train and its royal passengers arrived at Runcorn, Cheshire, yesterday morning after breakfast, Meghan and the Queen had spoken about the day ahead.That much was clear as they exchanged several observations during the ceremony to mark the opening of the Mersey Gateway Bridge.By the time she had watched the Queen unveil two plaques, completed a walkabout, attended a civic lunch and accepted numerous posies, her early stiffness had gone and she began to relax.Next week\u0027s carriage drive at Royal Ascot should be breeze. And next month sees an event where it\u0027s just possible that the Queen will be turning to the newest member of the family for help – the arrival in London of Meghan\u0027s fellow American, US President Donald Trump.

As machines increasingly shape global events, how can we regain control?The voice-activated gadget in the corner of your bedroom suddenly laughs maniacally, and sends a recording of your pillow talk to a colleague. The clip of Peppa Pig your toddler is watching on YouTube unexpectedly descends into bloodletting and death. The social network you use to keep in touch with old school friends turns out to be influencing elections and fomenting coups.Something strange has happened to our way of thinking – and as a result, even stranger things are happening to the world. We have come to believe that everything is computable and can be resolved by the application of new technologies. But these technologies are not neutral facilitators: they embody our politics and biases, they extend beyond the boundaries of nations and legal jurisdictions and increasingly exceed the understanding of even their creators. As a result, we understand less and less about the world as these powerful technologies assume more control over our everyday lives.Across the sciences and society, in politics and education, in warfare and commerce, new technologies are not merely augmenting our abilities, they are actively shaping and directing them, for better and for worse. If we do not understand how complex technologies function then their potential is more easily captured by selfish elites and corporations. The results of this can be seen all around us. There is a causal relationship between the complex opacity of the systems we encounter every day and global issues of inequality, violence, populism and fundamentalism.Instead of a utopian future in which technological advancement casts a dazzling, emancipatory light on the world, we seem to be entering a new dark age characterised by ever more bizarre and unforeseen events. The Enlightenment ideal of distributing more information ever more widely has not led us to greater understanding and growing peace, but instead seems to be fostering social isions, distrust, conspiracy theories and post-factual politics. To understand what is happening, it’s necessary to understand how our technologies have come to be, and how we have come to place so much faith in them.In the 1950s, a new symbol began to creep into the diagrams drawn by electrical engineers to describe the systems they built: a fuzzy circle, or a puffball, or a thought bubble. Eventually, its form settled into the shape of a cloud. Whatever the engineer was working on, it could connect to this cloud, and that’s all you needed to know. The other cloud could be a power system, or a data exchange, or another network of computers. Whatever. It didn’t matter. The cloud was a way of reducing complexity, it allowed you to focus on the issues at hand. Over time, as networks grew larger and more interconnected, the cloud became more important. It became a business buzzword and a selling point. It became more than engineering shorthand it became a metaphor.Today the cloud is the central metaphor of the internet: a global system of great power and energy that nevertheless retains the aura of something numinous, almost impossible to grasp. We work in it we store and retrieve stuff from it it is something we experience all the time without really understanding what it is. But there’s a problem with this metaphor: the cloud is not some magical faraway place, made of water vapour and radio waves, where everything just works. It is a physical infrastructure consisting of phone lines, fibre optics, satellites, cables on the ocean floor, and vast warehouses filled with computers, which consume huge amounts of water and energy. Absorbed into the cloud are many of the previously weighty edifices of the civic sphere: the places where we shop, bank, socialise, borrow books and vote. Thus obscured, they are rendered less visible and less amenable to critique, investigation, preservation and regulation.Over the last few decades, trading floors around the world have fallen silent, as people are replaced by banks of computers that trade automatically. Digitisation meant that trades within, as well as between, stock exchangescould happen faster and faster. As trading passed into the hands of machines, it became possible to react almost instantaneously. High-Frequency Trading (HFT) algorithms, designed by former physics PhD students to take advantage of millisecond advantages, entered the market, and traders gave them names such as The Knife. These algorithms were capable of eking out fractions of a cent on every trade, and they could do it millions of times a day.In the chaos of those 25 minutes, 2bn shares, worth $56bn, changed hands. Even more worryingly, many orders were executed at what the Securities Exchange Commission called “irrational prices”: as low as a penny, or as high as $100,000. The event became known as the “flash crash”, and it is still being investigated and argued over years later.One report by regulators found that high-frequency traders exacerbated the price swings. Among the various HFT programs, many had hard-coded sell points: prices at which they were programmed to sell their stocks immediately. As prices started to fall, groups of programs were triggered to sell at the same time. As each waypoint was passed, the subsequent price fall triggered another set of algorithms to automatically sell their stocks, producing a feedback effect. As a result, prices fell faster than any human trader could react to. While experienced market players might have been able to stabilise the crash by playing a longer game, the machines, faced with uncertainty, got out as quickly as possible.Other theories blame the algorithms for initiating the crisis. One technique that was identified in the data was HFT programmes sending large numbers of “non-executable” orders to the exchanges – that is, orders to buy or sell stocks so far outside of their usual prices that they would be ignored. The purpose of such orders is not to actually communicate or make money, but to deliberately cloud the system, so that other, more valuable trades can be executed in the confusion. Many orders that were never intended to be executed were actually fulfilled, causing wild volatility.At 1.07pm on 23 April 2013 Associated Press sent a tweet to its 2 million followers: “Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured.” The message was the result of a hack later claimed by the Syrian Electronic Army, a group affiliated to Syrian president Bashar al-Assad. AP and other journalists quickly flooded the site with alerts that the message was false. The algorithms following breaking news stories had no such discernment, however. At 1.08pm, the Dow Jones went into a nosee. Before most human viewers had even seen the tweet, the index had fallen 150 points in under two minutes, and bounced back to its earlier value. In that time, it erased $136bn in equity market value.Computation is increasingly layered across, and hidden within, every object in our lives, and with its expansion comes an increase in opacity and unpredictability. One of the touted benefits of Samsung’s line of “smart fridges” in 2015 was their integration with Google’s calendar services, allowing owners to schedule grocery deliveries from the kitchen. It also meant that hackers who gained access to the then inadequately secured machines could read their owner’s Gmail passwords. Researchers in Germany discovered a way to insert malicious code into Philips’s wifi-enabled Hue lightbulbs, which could spread from fixture to fixture throughout a building or even a city, turning the lights rapidly on and off and – in one possible scenario – triggering photosensitive epilepsy. This is the approach favoured by Byron the Bulb in Thomas Pynchon’s Gravity’s Rainbow, an act of grand revolt by the little machines against the tyranny of their makers. Once-fictional possibilities for technological violence are being realised by the Internet of Things.In Kim Stanley Robinson’s novel Aurora, an intelligent spacecraft carries a human crew from Earth to a distant star. The journey will take multiple lifetimes, so one of the ship’s jobs is to ensure that the humans look after themselves. When their fragile society breaks down, threatening the mission, the ship deploys safety systems as a means of control: it is able to see everywhere through sensors, open or seal doors at will, speak so loudly through its communications equipment that it causes physical pain, and use fire suppression systems to draw down the level of oxygen in a particular space.This is roughly the same suite of operations available now from Google Home and its partners: a network of internet-connected cameras for home security, smart locks on doors, a thermostat capable of raising and lowering the temperature in inidual rooms, and a fire and intruder detection system that emits a piercing emergency alarm. Any successful hacker would have the same powers as the Aurora does over its crew, or Byron over his hated masters.Before dismissing such scenarios as the fever dreams of science fiction writers, consider again the rogue algorithms in the stock exchanges. These are not isolated events, but everyday occurrences within complex systems. The question then becomes, what would a rogue algorithm or a flash crash look like in the wider reality?Mirai, in fact, looks like nothing so much as Stuxnet, another virus discovered within the industrial control systems of hydroelectric plants and factory assembly lines in 2010. Stuxnet was a military-grade cyberweapon when dissected, it was found to be aimed specifically at Siemens centrifuges, and designed to go off when it encountered a facility that possessed a particular number of such machines. That number corresponded with one particular facility: the Natanz nuclear facility in Iran. When activated, the program would quietly degrade crucial components of the centrifuges, causing them to break down and disrupt the Iranian enrichment programme.The attack was apparently partially successful, but the effect on other infected facilities is unknown. To this day, despite obvious suspicions, nobody knows where Stuxnet came from, or who made it. Nobody knows for certain who developed Mirai, either, or where its next iteration might come from, but it might be there, right now, breeding in the CCTV camera in your office, or the wifi-enabled kettle in the corner of your kitchen.Or perhaps the crash will look like a string of blockbuster movies pandering to rightwing conspiracies and survivalist fantasies, from quasi-fascist superheroes (Captain America and the Batman series) to justifications of torture and assassination (Zero Dark Thirty, American Sniper). In Hollywood, studios run their scripts through the neural networks of a company called Epagogix, a system trained on the unstated preferences of millions of moviegoers developed over decades in order to predict which lines will push the right – meaning the most lucrative – emotional buttons. Algorithmic engines enhanced with data from Netflix, Hulu, YouTube and others, with access to the minute-by-minute preferences of millions of video watchers acquire a level of cognitive insight undreamed of by previous regimes. Feeding directly on the frazzled, binge-watching desires of news-saturated consumers, the network turns on itself, reflecting, reinforcing and heightening the paranoia inherent in the system.Game developers enter endless cycles of updates and in-app purchases directed by AB testing interfaces and real-time monitoring of players’ behaviours. They have such a fine-grained grasp of dopamine-producing neural pathways that teenagers die of exhaustion in front of their computers, unable to tear themselves away.Or perhaps the flash crash will look like literal nightmares broadcast across the network for all to see? In the summer of 2015, the sleep disorders clinic of an Athens hospital was busier than it had ever been: the country’s debt crisis was in its most turbulent period. Among the patients were top politicians and civil servants, but the machines they spent the nights hooked up to, monitoring their breathing, their movements, even the things they said out loud in their sleep, were sending that information, together with their personal medical details, back to the manufacturers’ diagnostic data farms in northern Europe. What whispers might escape from such facilities?We are able to record every aspect of our daily lives by attaching technology to the surface of our bodies, persuading us that we too can be optimised and upgraded like our devices. Smart bracelets and smartphone apps with integrated step counters and galvanic skin response monitors track not only our location, but every breath and heartbeat, even the patterns of our brainwaves. Users are encouraged to lay their phones beside them on their beds at night, so that their sleep patterns can be recorded. Where does all this data go, who owns it, and when might it come out? Data on our dreams, our night terrors and early morning sweating jags, the very substance of our unconscious selves, turn into more fuel for systems both pitiless and inscrutable.Or perhaps the flash crash in reality looks exactly like everything we are experiencing right now: rising economic inequality, the breakdown of the nation-state and the militarisation of borders, totalising global surveillance and the curtailment of inidual freedoms, the triumph of transnational corporations and neurocognitive capitalism, the rise of far-right groups and nativist ideologies, and the degradation of the natural environment. None of these are the direct result of novel technologies, but all of them are the product of a general inability to perceive the wider, networked effects of inidual and corporate actions accelerated by opaque, technologically augmented complexity.In New York in 1997, world chess champion Garry Kasparov faced off for the second time against Deep Blue, a computer specially designed by IBM to beat him. When he lost, he claimed some of Deep Blue’s moves were so intelligent and creative that they must have been the result of human intervention. But we understand why Deep Blue made those moves: its process for selecting them was ultimately one of brute force, a massively parallel architecture of 14,000 custom-designed chess chips, capable of analysing 200m board positions per second. Kasparov was not outthought, merely outgunned.By the time the Google Brain–powered AlphaGo software took on the Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol in 2016, something had changed. In the second of five games, AlphaGo played a move that stunned Sedol, placing one of its stones on the far side of the board. “That’s a very strange move,” said one commentator. “I thought it was a mistake,” said another. Fan Hui, a seasoned Go player who had been the first professional to lose to the machine six months earlier, said: “It’s not a human move. I’ve never seen a human play this move.”AlphaGo went on to win the game, and the series. AlphaGo’s engineers developed its software by feeding a neural network millions of moves by expert Go players, and then getting it to play itself millions of times more, developing strategies that outstripped those of human players. But its own representation of those strategies is illegible: we can see the moves it made, but not how it decided to make them.The late Iain M Banks called the place where these moves occurred “Infinite Fun Space”. In Banks’s SF novels, his Culture civilisation is administered by benevolent, superintelligent AIs called simply Minds. While the Minds were originally created by humans, they have long since redesigned and rebuilt themselves and become all-powerful. Between controlling ships and planets, directing wars and caring for billions of humans, the Minds also take up their own pleasures. Capable of simulating entire universes within their imaginations, some Minds retreat for ever into Infinite Fun Space, a realm of meta-mathematical possibility, accessible only to superhuman artificial intelligences.Many of us are familiar with Google Translate, which was launched in 2006, using a technique called statistical language inference. Rather than trying to understand how languages actually worked, the system imbibed vast corpora of existing translations: parallel texts with the same content in different languages. By simply mapping words on to one another, it removed human understanding from the equation and replaced it with data-driven correlation.Translate was known for its humorous errors, but in 2016, the system started using a neural network developed by Google Brain, and its abilities improved exponentially. Rather than simply cross-referencing heaps of texts, the network builds its own model of the world, and the result is not a set of two-dimensional connections between words, but a map of the entire territory. In this new architecture, words are encoded by their distance from one another in a mesh of meaning – a mesh only a computer could comprehend.While a human can draw a line between the words “tank” and “water” easily enough, it quickly becomes impossible to draw on a single map the lines between “tank” and “revolution”, between “water” and “liquidity”, and all of the emotions and inferences that cascade from those connections. The map is thus multidimensional, extending in more directions than the human mind can hold. As one Google engineer commented, when pursued by a journalist for an image of such a system: “I do not generally like trying to visualise thousand-dimensional vectors in three-dimensional space.” This is the unseeable space in which machine learning makes its meaning. Beyond that which we are incapable of visualising is that which we are incapable of even understanding.In the same year, other researchers at Google Brain set up three networks called Alice, Bob and Eve. Their task was to learn how to encrypt information. Alice and Bob both knew a number – a key, in cryptographic terms – that was unknown to Eve. Alice would perform some operation on a string of text, and then send it to Bob and Eve. If Bob could decode the message, Alice’s score increased but if Eve could, Alice’s score decreased.Over thousands of iterations, Alice and Bob learned to communicate without Eve breaking their code: they developed a private form of encryption like that used in private emails today. But crucially, we don’t understand how this encryption works. Its operation is occluded by the deep layers of the network. What is hidden from Eve is also hidden from us. The machines are learning to keep their secrets.How we understand and think of our place in the world, and our relation to one another and to machines, will ultimately decide where our technologies will take us. We cannot unthink the network we can only think through and within it. The technologies that inform and shape our present perceptions of reality are not going to go away, and in many cases we should not wish them to. Our current life support systems on a planet of 7.5 billion people and rising depend on them. Our understanding of those systems, and of the conscious choices we make in their design, remain entirely within our capabilities. We are not powerless, not without agency. We only have to think, and think again, and keep thinking. The network – us and our machines and the things we think and discover together – demands it.Computational systems, as tools, emphasise one of the most powerful aspects of humanity: our ability to act effectively in the world and shape it to our desires. But uncovering and articulating those desires, and ensuring that they do not degrade, overrule, efface, or erase the desires of others, remains our prerogative.When Kasparov was defeated back in 1997, he didn’t give up the game. A year later, he returned to competitive play with a new format: advanced, or centaur, chess. In advanced chess, humans partner, rather than compete, with machines. And it rapidly became clear that something very interesting resulted from this approach. While even a mid-level chess computer can today wipe the floor with most grandmasters, an average player paired with an average computer is capable of beating the most sophisticated supercomputer – and the play that results from this combination of ways of thinking has revolutionised the game. It remains to be seen whether cooperation is possible – or will be permitted – with the kinds of complex machines and systems of governance now being developed, but understanding and thinking together offer a more hopeful path forward than obfuscation and dominance.Our technologies are extensions of ourselves, codified in machines and infrastructures, in frameworks of knowledge and action. Computers are not here to give us all the answers, but to allow us to put new questions, in new ways, to the universe •"},{"url":null,"title":"late night roundup stephen colbert doj report comey","story":"Late-night comics discussed the DoJ report on James Comey’s investigation of Hillary Clinton and the World CupLate-night hosts discussed the start of the World Cup and the findings of the Department of Justice inspector general’s report about James Comey’s handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation.On The Late Show, Stephen Colbert spoke of how Donald Trump and his inner circle expected the report to show proof of a devious deep state working against him. “There is proof of a huge conspiracy working against getting Trump elected: a shadowy group known as the popular vote,” he said.One of the few minor “revelations” in the report was a text message conversation between FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who claimed they would try to stop Trump from becoming president.“Two FBI agents in a conspiracy to stop Donald Trump from becoming president. Then just to cover their tracks, they don’t stop him,” Colbert joked. “That’s how deep this goes.”Ultimately the report showed that Comey wasn’t motivated by nefarious reasons when he decided to reopen the investigation.“Good news: the head of the FBI wasn’t corrupt, just super dumb,” he said.On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah spoke about the beginning of the World Cup in Russia and the country’s attempts to try and ignore their negative image. One of their tactics included training train conductors to smile. “I feel like the only thing worse than a non-smiling Russian is a smiling Russian,” he said.Noah continued: “On the face of it, Russia is trying to portray a friendly image, but there are some things they can’t cover up.”One of the major concerns during the tournament is the treatment of LGBT fans in a country with an openly bigoted agenda. “It’s been reported that gay men kissing will be reported to the police, and I’m assuming gay women kissing must be reported directly to Vladimir Putin,” Noah joked.“There’s also been a rise in Russian fans singing racist chants which wouldn’t be a problem if y’all just kept the vuvuzelas,” he said.There have also been journalists complaining about being followed by shadowy figures. “Oh and as for freedom of the press, it’s fair to say you probably shouldn’t say anything,” he said.On Late Night with Seth Meyers, the host started by listing the many problematic decisions made by Trump this week. “Every day he acts more and more like an NBA player who’s trying to be traded to a rival team,” he said.In a tweet, Trump again referred to the press as the biggest enemy in America. “You know who’s really breathing a sigh of relief right now? Isis,” he joked.The Republican senator Bob Corker referred to the party as a cult-like situation in a TV interview which had Meyers joking: “Oh come on, it’s not a cult. In a cult you have to abandon all your beliefs and have weird sex with a bunch of people and, OK, maybe it’s a cult.”He moved on to the growing problems facing Trump’s lawyer Michael Cohen. “Cohen probably RSVPs to weddings ‘yes unless indicted’,” he joked.In a Vanity Fair article, a source claimed that Cohen is the most likely to blow Trump up. “Donald Trump has already blown up,” he said. “He’s blown up a thousand times but he keeps walking away. He’s President Wile E Coyote.”He also spoke about the findings of the inspector general’s report. “James Comey was using a private email account while investigating Hillary Clinton for using a private email account,” he said. “If you just excuse me for a second I’m going to put my head on the desk and mutter ‘motherfucker’.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3432c79ea76acc2c8679c760ed7471da5da52b73/0_15_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4d143cfa1abd74a92d8dbeff43c90e48","title":"looking back at standing rock in pictures","story":"Photographer Josué Rivas spent seven months documenting the Native American community that came together to protest against the controversial Dakota pipeline.

Get a snap of yourself holding the tower in the palm of your hand by posing farther down the promenade and then return to the famous ballroom to try out your waltz, paso doble and cha-cha-cha.

Now a Unesco world heritage site, and one of England’s greatest landmarks, Hadrian’s Wall threads along almost 80 miles from coast to coast, running from the river Tyne to the Solway Firth. It is the best-preserved frontier of the Roman empire, which ruled much of England for almost 400 years. Along the wall you will find the Roman town of Corbridge, and Roman temples and forts – as well as some incredible homes to stay in.Search for homes on Airbnb in historic NorthumberlandFind Little JamaicaWant to get your jerk on?

Head to south London’s Stockwell area, where you will find cafes and restaurants serving Portuguese food. There is a huge Portuguese community in this part of London – the largest outside the country itself. Check out Madeira cafe, which sells cakes and pastries, and has a bakery that makes 20,000 pastéis de nata per day, to be sent out across London. Or head to Sintra delicatessen, which sells everything from Portuguese sweets to cheeses and chorizo sausages.

Sofia Genders, co-founder of End of the Road Festival and Sheffield insider, has your ultimate 48-hour guide to the cityDay one – yoga, shopping and arty hangoutsExplore what Sheffield’s buzzing neighbourhoods have to offer. Spend the morning getting to know the hip, leafy suburb of Nether Edge – start with a yoga class at Hot Yoga Sheffield on Edgedale Road, then grab a healthy smoothie at the Wild Leaf cafe next door. Yoga was such a great stress-buster when I was running End of the Road festival, and it never fails to put me in a great frame of mind, whether I’m working or enjoying a day off.Next, take a stroll to nearby Abbeydale Road, also known as the antiques quarter. On the first Sunday of the month this vintage wonderland of a street also hosts a flea market at the Abbeydale Picture House – a gorgeous old venue that regularly screens black-and-white early cinema and hosts various cultural events. Spend some time wandering around the Vaults to find something special among the weird and wonderful retro items, or try the eclectic Rileys \u0026amp Co for vintage furniture, kitsch collectables and local crafts. I also love finding bargains in charity shops – there are quite a few along Abbeydale Road. Sticking with the retro theme, a visit to Jameson’s Cafe \u0026amp Tea Rooms is my all-time favourite afternoon tea spot, with great service and a live pianist. Two minutes walk down the road, there’s a great secondhand record store called Below. Also close by on Nether Edge Road, is the intimate and laid back Cafe #9 – perfect for a pick-me-up, plus they host live music now and again.As the afternoon rolls on, head to the villagey Sharrow Vale Road, where you can browse independent shops, delis and boutiques – such as the Front Parlour or Porter Book Shop – before grabbing an artisan doughnut and coffee from Eve Kitchen.If you need something more substantial, you could grab a late lunch from Porter Pizza on Sharrow Vale Road, probably the best pizza in town. It’s takeaway-only but the gorgeous Endcliffe Park is just around the corner, and is a top spot for a pizza picnic and a quick post-lunch stroll around the beautiful woodland.Alternatively, hop in a cab to Chesterfield Road in the up-and-coming Meersbrook area. Here, vegans are in luck: Make No Bones restaurant on Chesterfield Road is a true local’s favourite, or Just Falafs, on the same street, is a great fallback. That’s not to say that carnivores aren’t also well catered for in the area. I also really love the Tramshed Bar \u0026amp Kitchen – they’ve got a brilliant Asian menu, or you could just pop into the bar for a drink or two.Speaking of drinks, in the evening, Takk bar on Queens Road, Heeley, right on the edge of Sheffield city centre, is a great place for a dance and a cocktail in a fairy lit garden. You’ll find it in Hagglers Corner, a creative courtyard community of artists and independent makers, which doubles as an arts venue. If pubs are more your thing, the Brothers Arms and the Sheaf View are both nearby and have a reputation for top quality real ale.If you’re after a gig, try the Audacious Art Experiment, the eponymous venue of the local record label, on Harwood Street. Alternatively, head back to Abbeydale Road and check out Picture House Social, for an eclectic line-up of music events, with great cocktails, craft beer, Italian-inspired street food and a games room, too. I’m a big fan of small, independent venues with creative programming as they’re vital to a healthy music industry – both are destinations for the in-the-know crowd and have some great shows on.Day two – coffee, cake and creative curationThe second day is when you’ll find out what the city centre has to offer, plus a visit to Kelham Island, a riverside area that was once the central hub of Sheffield’s industry, and one of the oldest sites of its kind in the city.Start your day with a good coffee. There are so many great places to choose from, depending on where you are based. Tamper is a New Zealand coffee place with an industrial feel – its main outpost is housed in a 19th-century former silversmith workshop on Arundel Street. On the same street is the Holt, a true hidden gem of a coffee place, while tucked away on Aberdeen Court is Steam Yard, with a cosy feel and amazing cakes.Spend the rest of your morning checking out some of the best shops the city has to offer – in particular stroll along Division Street and the surrounding roads. Syd and Mallory sells the best handmade clothing and reworked fashion. La Biblioteka is a great little bookshop stocking a massive range of magazines and books from independent publishers, plus stationery. When I’m looking for good music, I often discover something new and fresh at Bear Tree Records – a lovely shop that sells both new and secondhand vinyl.While you wander, keep your eyes peeled. Sheffield is full of great street art, sculpture, graffiti and wall murals by local artists such as Jo Peel, Faunagraphic, Phlegm and more. Street Art Sheffield lists many of the sites if you’d like to plan ahead. One of my favourite sculptures is the Women of Steel by Martin Jennings outside City Hall. It commemorates the women who worked in the city’s steel industry during the first and second world wars.After a morning stroll, stop for lunch at Dina Diner, a vegetarian and vegan cafe attached to a music, comedy, poetry and theatre venue that is a social enterprise and platform for emerging artists. Dina is an example of what I like about most of Sheffield’s creative spaces: the really thoughtful curation. Similarly, Gloam Gallery is another great space dedicated to creativity. Gloam’s Instagram is exciting and exhibitions here are fresh and unusual. In September, the Site Gallery will also be re-opening – another great creative space to check out.For dinner head to Kelham Island and the cosy, neighbourhood restaurant Stew and Oyster. Later in the evening, check out the Delicious Clam – a record label and an unmissable DIY venue where you’re guaranteed to hear something interesting and underground. A lot of bands start out there and it’s worth catching a show if you can. Something entirely different is Public, a recently-opened cocktail bar in a converted old public toilet – it’s another small venue, and really worth it.Last but not least, be sure to check out what is one of the best railway station pubs in the country – the Sheffield Tap, a place where my husband and I love to sit and watch the world go by. Located within the old first-class waiting room, this pub is also a microbrewery and has a great selection of craft beers.

In fact, with its fixie bikes, cobbled streets, Noma-ish foraged cuisine and design-first ethos, it almost feels like a pocket of Copenhagen that just happens to be a 90-minute train ride from London. Throw in the refurbished 1920s theme park Dreamland and it all adds up to an irresistible artist’s enclave for a weekend city. Armed with effusive recommendations from my Airbnb host Clare – a trend-forecaster and trainee florist ­– I set about experiencing the best of the Kentish coast’s new capital of cool. Here’s my guide to getting the best out of a trip to this unique seaside town.Follow the foodie trailThe seafront chippies are still drawing crowds (and e-bombing seagulls) but in recent years, Margate’s culinary scene has evolved. Open since 2015, Hantverk \u0026amp Found is a seafood cafe and gallery that exemplifies that uptick in quality, whether you’re after a big last-night-of-the-trip dinner or a casual lunch slurping local rock oysters spiked with yuzu (a citrus fruit) in the suntrap garden. The food is unfussy and brightly flavoured – think clams in a spicy Korean broth and bream with a heady brown shrimp butter. The dinky emerald-tiled room adds a lively, squashed-in thrum to proceedings.For a legendary cheese toastie, and great rooftop views for sunset, head to Cheesy Tiger on the jutting Harbour Arm, my Airbnb host advises. There’s also friendly little Fez bar, a quirky, eclectic boozer close by. Or for an array of beachfront eating and drinking options, then the The Bus Cafe – with its crammed and zingy salad wraps – and the adjacent Sun Deck, are the places to head to. “There’s a really good juice bar, Po’ Boy that does great Creole-style food, and a cool tiki bar,” says Ed Warren, local and co-founder of Cliffs record shop and cafe.Sound out local musicThere aren’t many cafes where you can watch an experimental radio show broadcasting to the world and have a flat white made by a double Mercury Music prize-winning nominee. A labour of love for musician Obara Ejimiwe (aka Ghostpoet) and his creative director wife Kate, Radio Margate is a hybrid coffee shop, late-night venue and internet radio station launched in 2017 following their move from London. This sea-view space – all calming jazz and tasteful mid-century furniture – is, according to the Ejimiwes, a direct result of Margate’s contagious creative energy. “It’s totally infectious and there’s more room here to develop strong, independent ideas,” Obara says.Housed in a lovingly restored former 1920s tearoom in Cliftonville, Cliffs is a record shop that also encompasses a fitness studio, coffee roastery, hair salon, gig venue and an exceptional cafe (try the harissa oil and avocado toast). “I just wanted to sell Motown records but we got caught up in it all, like a lot of people here do,” says owner Ed Warren, explaining how he and his interior designer partner Kier Muddiman found themselves presiding over this artfully-distressed cultural fiefdom. “All these interesting little places in Margate are from the heart, basically.”Hit refreshWalpole Bay tidal pool is a must for lovers of outdoor swimming. It is the UK’s largest saltwater bathing pool, covering 4 acres (1.6 hectares), and was built in 1937. A group of locals swear by a regular swim in this beautiful coastal location, which fills up at high tide each day. “The first time I jumped in I squealed with excitement as the cold water engulfed me,” says Kathryn Ferguson, Margate resident and director of Taking the Waters, a short film about the pool. “But it felt exhilarating and from that moment I was totally hooked. A full moon swim is something I’d recommend everyone to try once.”Sticking with the theme of wellness, it’s worth stopping by natural fragrance and skincare company Haeckels to pick up a few restorative products to take home. One of the town’s most famous success stories, it was founded by Dom Bridges, a former film director who turned a hobby making soap from foraged Margate seaweed into a brand stocked in Harvey Nichols. Still, little can prepare you for the surprise of its flagship laboratory, shop and sea-based thalassotherapy spa, high up on a blustery Cliftonville parade. “It’s an example of the fact that each business has an amazing story of its own,” says Shelly Keeys, owner of shrewdly curated local fashion store Ruskin.Shop independent art and designThose that know their parlour palms from their succulents will feel at home in the jungle interior of Mar Mar, a cafe, gift shop and houseplant emporium on Northdown Road. Bolstering the town’s roster of design boutiques (homewares store Môr is worth a look too), it grew from Central St Martins graduate Boe Holder’s bold, Memphis Group-influenced creations. “She used to do pot painting and sell these great plant pots online,” says Margate-based photographer Harriet Bentley. “Now they’re selling plants, coffee, magazines and other great little things. It’s so cool.”Other interiors shops worth seeking out include: Clayspace Studios, a social enterprise and ceramics store Danish Collectables for curated Scandinavian vintage pieces Papillon Interiors for vibrant indoor and outdoor furniture and Imagineican Store, a tiny design and lifestyle studio. If you hire a bike during your trip, Westgate-on-sea is about a 15-minute cycle from Margate’s seafront, and is home to Eighty Two Westgate.Of course, one of the biggest draws in town for art is the Turner Contemporary, which opened in 2011 and sowed the first seeds for the current regenerative flowering. Smaller venues, such as Pie Factory in the Old Town, also a studio complex and, yes, former pie shop, are increasingly offering a platform to Margate’s thriving ecosystem of emerging visual artists and Turner-exhibited stars of tomorrow. “There’s such a strong creative network here,” notes Dan Chilcott, co-founder of nearby Resort Studios, who put together a June show at the Pie Factory. “As an artist, it’s right where you want to be.”Jimi Famurewa is a London-based freelance writer and editor.

Teachers, students and parents were told last week, before the education watchdog released its report, that the Discovery school in Newcastle would close for good at the end of the academic year.Ofsted staff were called in for a snap inspection after safeguarding concerns were raised when a child was left in London during a school trip in March.Their report revealed that staff were unable to cope with bad and sometimes dangerous behaviour, while teaching quality plummeted and children were left “underachieving”.In more detailed findings about behaviour, Ofsted inspectors wrote: “A hard core of pupils display riotous behaviour and they roam the school in a predatory manner. The small numbers of girls and others who are singled out as different are vulnerable and do not always feel safe. “The frequency of dangerous and unacceptable behaviour is shockingly high.”Inspectors described the behaviour of year 9 pupils being so bad that they were barred from using machinery or the computer suite because of safety concerns.The report claimed racism, sexism and bullying were prevalent, with pupils sharing “depressing testimony of their ordeals and perceived lack of adult support” with inspectors.The government withdrew funding for the specialist science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (Stem) school before its second-ever Ofsted report. Opened in 2014, at a reported cost of £9m, the free school invited students from across north-east England to experience an “alternative option to a traditional school”. But during its first inspection in July 2017 inspectors said it had a “narrow and unbalanced” curriculum that was “failing to meet pupils’ needs”.Its governing body, overseen by the NCG group, which also runs Newcastle college, was told there were key failings in its responsibilities, including in overseeing safeguarding. The school has struggled to attract pupils despite having capacity for up to 700 pupils, it currently has just 228 enrolled. The school will close at the end of the academic year. A spokesperson said: “Clearly this Ofsted report makes for difficult reading and the depth and severity of the comments were a key factor in the decision to close the school.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c7f07a5d722ccf38d2b8f2d7c7e2d70bc87931/0_231_5125_3074/master/5125.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d6f53acfba0b9df29436cab8e205d84b","title":"can scotland save its wildcats from extinction","story":"The secretive mammals are fast disappearing from the Highlands but last-ditch efforts to save them are fraught with challengesSet deep in mixed woodland of Scots pine and birch, near the banks of the river Beauly in Inverness-shire, several huge, concealed pens contain two breeding pairs of Scottish wildcat.Wildcats mate from January to March, and their high, anguished breeding calls through the dark winter nights are thought to have inspired tales of the Cat Sith, a spectral feline of Celtic legend that was believed to haunt the Highlands. “It is a cry that carries over quite a distance and it is spine-chilling if you hear it in the middle of the night,” says Sir John Lister-Kaye, renowned nature writer and director of the Aigas Field Centre. The former Victorian sporting estate, which now offers conservation holidays and environmental education, is one of 20 sites currently participating in a conservation breeding programme led by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS).“I’m sure that if there were other wildcats nearby they would have been attracted to the calls. But since we started in 2011 we’ve had foxes, pine martins, badgers, one or two domestic cats come and have a look – but not a single wildcat anywhere near.”The Scottish wildcat is now one of the most critically endangered wild mammals native to the UK, according to a comprehensive analysis by the Mammal Society released earlier this week, which estimated the population at 200 but accepts that the figure may be significantly lower.“I think it’s desperate,” says Lister-Kaye, who believes the population in the wild may have dwindled to the low tens. “We’re at the last possible moment to try and recover this species from extinction.” He is currently awaiting the birth of more wildcat kittens – the pairs have successfully produced six live offspring since they were homed at Aigas, while a further 71 live in captive breeding programmes around the UK, coordinated from the RZSS Highland Wildlife Park near Aviemore.Wildcats may look distinctive with their muscular bodies, flat faces and thick, blunt tails, but they are are notoriously difficult to monitor, as Roo Campbell of Scottish Wildcat Action (SWA) explains: “They are so secretive. They are one of a few mammals that have proper cryptic camouflage, this brown, buff and black striping that breaks up their outline. They can really hide themselves and move around without being seen.”Based 10 miles to the east of Aigas, in Inverness, SWA was set up by the Scottish government agency Scottish Natural Heritage in 2015 to implement a five-year national conservation plan to restore a viable population of wildcats north of the Highland fault line.Tracking difficulties are compounded by the problem of reliably distinguishing between a wildcat and a hybridised cat, the result of a wildcat breeding with a feral or domestic cat. While the SWA will pay for farm or domestic cats living near suspected wildcat habitat to be neutered, as well as vaccinating feral cats in order to curb exposure to feline diseases, most specialists accept that all wildcats in Scotland exhibit a degree of hybridisation.“We then have to find a line in the sand,” explains David Barclay, who manages the RZSS breeding programme, “a point at which a cat is so hybridised that is has no conservation value because it is so far removed from a wildcat genetically.”Although some vocal critics argue it is better to leave the few remaining pockets in the wild to breed in isolation, the majority of those working in wildcat conservation are convinced that hope rests with captive breeding, then rewilding.Barclay is blunt about the reality of the situation. “Of course we want to conserve the population in the wild, and that should be the priority, but when you have such a bad population in the wild, bordering on extinction, it doesn’t matter what you do – neuter feral cats, remove all the threats – unless you add more animals.”Nor is species recovery and re-introduction a speedy process, he adds, and is dependent on committed iniduals accepting that their efforts in the wild have been in vain. “When the data is indicating that the likelihood is there is no viable species, the danger is that you don’t act because you think it might be controversial. We’ve got to be careful that we don’t get into a situation where we are researching the animal to death, or focusing on just one photograph that gets a lot of publicity because it might be a wildcat.”Lister-Kaye concurs that “only way forward is to capture-breed from high quality hybrids, and by selective breeding over several generations increase the population.”But that is only half the story, he cautions. “The reason that Scottish wildcats have declined so dramatically is loss of habitat, to commercial forestry, industrial agriculture and urbanisation. So finding areas where there are the right prey species in sufficient numbers to support a wildcat population is very difficult.”While wildcats enjoy mosaic habitats, and would be capable of surviving on the edge of woodland, farmland, even towns, the risks of persecution and genetic pollution in those areas for the re-introduced population would remain high. “The ideal would be very wild areas, but in the Highlands they have got a gross over population of deer which have over-grazed the landscape, removing vegetation for wildcat prey species. So it isn’t at all simple.”While Barclay remains confident that “species recovery is a proven tool”, Lister-Kaye points to the successful conservation breeding programme with Iberian lynx in Spain: “You do have to have the right habitat to release these animals into, but it has been done.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6767d749d47d1675435f106a723002135b4f39a4/0_0_3830_2544/master/3830.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c812fcaf8014d626654b94c5e9afc7a0 880w","title":"bfi munroe bergdorf women","story":"Institute says it appointed Bergdorf to ‘further the gender debate and encourage audiences to recognise the value of difference’The British Film Institute has come under attack for its decision to appoint the trans model and activist Munroe Bergdorf (who identifies as a woman) as the keynote speaker of its Woman with a Movie Camera summit, which is due to take place on 16 June.An open letter posted on the website ipetitions says Bergdorf’s role is “an an insult to all the women film-makers who struggle on a daily basis to get their films made”. Referring to Bergdorf throughout as male, the letter says: “We question the suitability of a male who has benefitted from the very structures we are critiquing as a speaker on the subject of women’s agency in relation to film-making … What kind of cultural work is being performed when a male is speaking on behalf of women film-makers?”“This speaker is upstaging the very urgency of women’s voices with another ‘what about men?’ narrative. As much as we support the rights of gender non-conforming males to be heard, this is not the forum for it.”The letter is authored by the film-maker and writer Julian Vigo and the film-maker Deirdre O’Neill. In a further statement to the , Vigo said: “The BFI conference allocated a space that should have been taken up by a woman film-maker to a man and so it seems our voices continue to be denied.”The summit is described by the BFI as “a day of talks and events on women, power and film”. It includes events such as Before and After Time’s Up and RIP #strongfemalecharacter.In a statement, the BFI said: “For our keynote speaker we expressly wanted a voice outside of film-making that could widen the lens. We invited Munroe because she represents a contemporary and interesting perspective on the subjects of the day.“We appreciate that Munroe’s involvement has provoked a strong and mixed reaction and we hope it will help further the gender debate in a positive and constructive way and encourage audiences to recognise and acknowledge the quality and value of difference, which we believe is a benefit to our industry and to our wider society.”Bergdorf was fired by L’Oréal in 2017 after posting racially charged comments on Facebook, and was subsequently appointed to Labour’s advisory board on LGBT rights. She quit that role in March after attacks in the tabloid press and by Conservatives.Bergdorf’s lack of experience as a film-maker has also come in for criticism: though she was involved in making Channel 4’s recent documentary What Makes a Woman, Bergdorf has no directing or producer credits."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1b93998c8815478083c0b904062aa35b4c1e3447/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ed3b58fb2e0f16b5918b2d4bb04893a2","title":"virtual reality vr film making documentaries face to face sheffield docfest","story":"Experience life after a horrific accident, play a customs officer or swim with sea otters.

My voice triggers her responses – which start off clipped and defensive but become increasingly intimate – to the point where I feel like I’d really like to hang out with her. Ayesha is one of six participants of Muslim descent that were filmed with Depthkit technology to enable a surprisingly lifelike encounter that challenges stereotypes. It puts me in the position of authority – do I choose the tough questions or the softer ones? At the end I’m asked to decide whether to let her in to the country or detain her further. There’s a lot of hype around augmented reality at the moment but this piece – which came about after the director, Asad J Malik, had a bad experience with a customs officer in Abu Dhabi – had a narrative thrust that felt different to what’s gone before. You could imagine this sort of encounter happening in your own home in the not too distant future. It was one of many immersive installations at Sheffield DocFest’s Alternate Realities programme, which featured 27 interactive and immersive projects including films, games and web projects. Experiences ranged from Gabo Arora and Saschka Unseld’s The Day the World Changed, a room-scale experience that bears witness to Hiroshima survivors and makes a powerful case for nuclear disarmament, to Martin Hertig’s playful Sensible Data  Mixed Emotions installation, in which three machines translate a selfie into a real-time drawing of your face accompanied by an email revealing your age, gender, “beauty levels” and mood – a witty comment on personal data collection.Dan Tucker, programmer for Alternate Realities, ided offerings into two strands: The World Unknown to You – installations with impact that take you to places that are hard to access or imagine – and Better Known Truths – 360-degree films experienced in a headset. Housed this year in Trafalgar Warehouse, a suitably grungy industrial building, the exhibition was free. I chatted to a lady in her 70s who’d returned over several days and was amazed that this sort of storytelling existed.Many of the 360 films I saw seemed to have finally dispensed with the idea of “taking you into someone else’s world” by simply placing a static camera in a location. Grenfell: Our Home, made by the indie production company Parable, filmed and interviewed a group of survivors in stereoscopic 360. Rather than dwell on the well-trodden news lines, the piece is about their homes in the tower, with their plants, artefacts and hand-drawn murals sensitively reimagined through animation. Benoît Felici’s The Real Thing is a charming film set in the Chinese towns of Suzhou and Tianducheng, where replicas of famous European landmarks – including Venice’s canals, Tower Bridge and the Eiffel Tower – exist. The surreal 360 journeys through these towns are complemented by first-hand stories from people who live there, such as the photographer who muses on what it might be like to live in the “real” European city while photographing Chinese couples in their wedding attire. Face to Face, commissioned by the festival and winner of the alternate realities virtual reality award, was an extraordinary three-room experience involving the shocking story of Michelle Fox who, in 2009, was injured in a near-fatal gun accident caused by her ex-husband. She lost her eyes, nose and upper palate and now wears a silicone facial prosthetic made specially for her. The photojournalist Michelle Gabel had been documenting her life since 2014 and was then introduced to Michaela Holland, an immersive storyteller who collaborated with them on this piece. Each room in the installation is based on spaces from Fox’s home. The first is a living room, where I’m invited to spend 15 minutes absorbing her world. The walls are lined with family photographs, kids’ drawings and cuddly toys. The TV streams old home movies of her: dancing with her toddler, at a birthday party, playing dress-up with her daughter – all pre-accident. But in a drawer is a police witness statement from her friend Rebecca, describing what happened on the day of the accident. It’s gut-wrenching, visceral and heartbreaking. In the second room, a blue bathroom, I’m told to choose a facial “prosthetic”. These are in fact bespoke 3D-printed VR headsets with faces of different skin tones – there are seven or eight to choose from, and I duly reach for one that matches mine. When I don the headset, I see Michelle standing at her bathroom mirror, a bandana around her upper face, preparing to put her prosthetic on. The 360 film voiced by her shows moments of her daily life interwoven with animation and photographs. We glimpse what being blind has been like for her – like the fact that her daughter will forever remain as a five-year-old in her mind’s eye. What happens in the final room (a dining space) catches me off guard – although I won’t give the surprise away since Face to Face will hopefully be shown in other venues.Traumatic events and memories was a theme in the exhibition - just as it often is in documentary filmmaking. Mind at War was made by Australian comic book illustrator Sutu who tells the story of Scott England’s experience of PTSD after he enlisted in the US military and was posted to Iraq. Drawn with Google’s Tiltbrush, the most powerful scenes are the moments in Iraq when he’s desperately hoping not to shoot anyone and when he witnesses a father setting himself on fire after his son was run over by the US military. The experience is going to be used by NGO’s such as the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) to raise awareness of PTSD and the ambition is to distribute it for free as widely as possible.Vestige is a beautiful room scale VR piece which explores the memories of Lisa Elin in the aftermath of her husband Eric’s death in 2016. Director Aaron Bradbury had over 15 hours of audio interview with Lisa recorded over the phone. This became the backbone to scenes that visualise some of the stories she tells with the use of two actors playing Lisa and Eric who were volumetrically motion captured. It’s a bit like stepping into someone’s fragmented mind – the memories come thick and fast, brought to life by her effervescent, passionate voice.Life in VR: California Coast offered welcome relief from such intense affairs. A stunning CGI interactive experience from BBC Studios, it explored underwater ecosystems from microscopic creatures to sea otters and the humpback whale – a virtual Blue Planet that enabled you to swim with these creatures. This is VR that encapsulates the BBC’s core mission to inform, educate and entertain. As with many of the works showing at Sheffield DocFest, it suggests that virtual reality is becoming ever more complex, rich and thought-provoking.

After 80 minutes in which almost nothing had happened, other than the non-appearance of Mohamed Salah, Uruguay had begun to increase the pressure.Edinson Cavani had a volley pawed away by Ahmed El-Shenawy then smacked a free-kick against the post before, with a minute to go, José María Giménez rose to meet a right-wing corner with a powerful header and Uruguay, for the first time since 1970, had won their opening game at a World Cup.“The paths to scoring a goal are infinite,” Oscar Tabárez, Uruguay’s experienced manager, said, “and they’re all valid.”He is right and in retrospect this will probably be regarded as a masterpiece of patience and game management. Perhaps it was but for much of its length the game had seemed to conform to the stereotype of modern international football. The better teams can defend and can hold their shape, and very few sides have the cohesion to attack with the pace or precision to break them down. That was exacerbated by a pitch that seemed to have been insufficiently watered. As in the early stages of the opening game, before Saudi Arabia’s implosion, there was a sense that the ball was sticking, reducing further the pace of attacks.The result is slightly scrappy, underwhelming football, short of fluidity or goalmouth action – and, correspondingly, a premium on the sort of dynamic attacking player who can transform games. And the brightest of those this season, was missing. After all the excitement of Thursday, and the overblown response to one line from Héctor Cúper at a press conference that was replete with equivocation, Salah did not start.He had seemed tentative performing some basic windmill exercises in training and his only involvement was to elicit a great roar from the Egypt fans as he trotted out to warm-up and then another cheer – and a chorus of happy birthday (he turned 26 today) – when he was shown on big screens midway through the first half.“Yesterday we were quite certain during the training session that he would be able to play,” Cúper said. “Afterwards he was examined by the doctors and there was some doubt that if he fell or was hit by another player he would suffer another injury. So we decided not to take that risk because we want him in top form for the games against Russia and Saudi Arabia.”The reasoning is sound enough but after Russia’s 5-0 win over Saudi Arabia, there is significant pressure on Egypt when they meet the hosts on Tuesday. “Salah is an extremely important player for us, nobody can deny that,” Cúper added, “but I always stress you have to have a good team. Perhaps if he had been on the pitch we would have had a different result but you cannot say that.”There are questions too about Uruguay’s great attacking talents. Edinson Cavani and Luis Suárez are 31 and there is perhaps a sense that they owe Uruguay a big World Cup. Cavani, operating in wide roles, had little impact in either 2010 and 2014 and compounded the image of himself as a player uncomfortable in major tournaments with his red card against Chile in the quarter-final of the 2015 Copa América, albeit after significant digital provocation from Gonzalo Jara. Suárez had, at least, contributed five goals in 2010 and 2014, but his two most memorable acts at World Cups remain a handball and a bite.Although Cavani became increasingly influential as the game went on, it was difficult to avoid the conclusion that neither benefited from the service they received.Uruguay showed themselves in qualifying to be a more fluent, more progressive side than the battlers of old, the emergence of Rodrigo Bentancur, Matías Vecino and Giorgian De Arrascaeta in midfield testament to the long-term youth development initiated by Tabárez when he returned to the national job in 2006.There was little sign of their ability against Egypt rather Uruguay, perhaps stymied by the pitch, dealt in a series of slightly aimless long balls that seemed to play into the hands of a well-organised and muscular defence.Suárez, having somehow scuffed wide form six yards in the first half, was then twice denied by Shenawy in one-on-ones in the second. Tabárez did not seem overly concerned. “You are asking me what happened to Suárez because he didn’t play very well,” he said. “I don’t know what happened. I will not speculate.“I’ve seen Messi, Pelé, Maradona not having a good day, not playing to potential in matches. This is not a sin. They have good times when every shot hits the back of the net and the goal seems to be huge, and other days the posts seem closer together. I’m not worried. As long as Suárez keeps playing and keeps trying to score we know he has great potential.”And that, perhaps, is the most encouraging aspect for Uruguay. They were not at their best and should gain coherence as the tournament goes on but they have three points on the board and, unless Egypt beat Russia, will seal qualification for the last 16 with a win over Saudi Arabia.“We showed great attitude, a lot of solidarity,” Tabárez said. “Some of the players didn’t play as well as they normally can but I’m sure the tiny issues will be fine-tuned.”It was not pretty from Uruguay but, as so often before, it was enough. Tabárez may aspire to more, may have Che Guevara’s quote about hardening yourself without losing your tenderness printed on the wall of his house in Montevideo, but he still demands victory. “We either die,” he said, “or we kill.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d21267c20ab1b5450c2188ba943896ed92a0de5/0_270_4118_2471/master/4118.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22f221cdbdeb391083bb640a9b8d3ad4","title":"empty seats uruguay egypt world cup fifa investigation","story":"Fifa is investigating after thousands of seats were left unfilled for Uruguay’s World Cup match against Egypt in Ekaterinburg.A Fifa spokesman said: “We can confirm that the official attendance for the match between Egypt and Uruguay in Ekaterinburg is 27,015.

There are dozens of other monuments acknowledging the Russians who lost their lives during the Battle of Stalingrad scattered around the city. It had prompted concerns that England fans might provoke their hosts by hanging St George’s flags on them.British police have worked with the Football Supporters’ Federation to make supporters aware of sensitive sites and there was an excited but respectful atmosphere on the streets of Volgograd as fans from several countries mixed.Situated in the south of Russia, Volgograd was a closed city until the 1990s and there had been some uncertainty about how residents would respond to the expected 4,000 England fans who began to trickle in on Friday before their side’s opening match against Tunisia on Monday.Some chose not to wear England shirts out of concern about attracting unwanted attention but most spoke of feeling welcomed by their hosts. One fan, who gave his name as Nobby Rob, from Cornwall, was proudly wearing his England shirt. “I flew via Riga in Latvia and Moscow to get here and mine is the only England shirt I’ve seen,” he said. “I think some others are a bit shy of wearing theirs but I’ve been all over the world watching England in it and didn’t want to stop now.”During Euro 2016 in France organised groups of Russians clashed with England fans on the streets of Marseille, with the violence tarnishing the tournament. “I got gassed in Marseille,” said Rob. “But I think Vladimir Putin doesn’t want it to kick off here so I think it will be all right.”At the airport, volunteers handed out pamphlets welcoming visitors to Volgograd. It claimed a number of myths about the country had been allowed to take hold. “The Russians are kind, friendly and hospitable people, always ready to help,” it said. “We are the same people like you are. And no, Russians don’t drink vodka all the time.”When a delegation from the Football Association visited the city in February it was so cold the Volga had frozen over. But the mercury hit 34C (93F) on Friday as supporters sought shade at the Fifa Fan Fest, a public viewing site where every game will be shown on a giant screen.Ellis and Clark Leake-Lyall, brothers from Brighton, watched as Uruguay beat Egypt with a last-minute winner. “This is the first time we’ve been to watch England,” said Ellis. “You can’t help but be affected by all the negative stories about Russia but we’ve found everyone to be really friendly since we arrived.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea7f831ed37e02b03c78f9dbfa381c0e2af4c1cc/0_4_5398_3239/master/5398.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c776e898918b1279e53f2362cdc7d329","title":"kylian mbappe france teenager","story":"The language of possibility sometimes gets lost in translation. Didier Deschamps, in Kazan preparing for France’s opening World Cup match, fielded many a question about the age and temperament of a squad replete with talent yet short on big tournament experience. Not since the first World Cup in 1930, when teams from Europe spent long days on a boat crossing the Atlantic to reach the original hosts in Uruguay, have France come to a World Cup with such a youthful gathering of talent.The word “risk” came up. When analysing the contribution of young players it is just as easy to accentuate the positive – boldness, fearlessness, freshness – as the negative. But that word hung in the air a little reproachfully, lobbed at Deschamps a little anxiously. The inference was clear. Inexperience. Would it inhibit? Might it lead to a rash mistake? “It is not a risk,” Deschamps retorted. “Those young people are there, and if I have selected them it is because they are good for the team. They are here because they have the quality to be here.”From this 23‑man squad 14 will be taking their first steps on to the big tournament stage – but they are hardly rookies, elevated suddenly from nowhere. The youngest of the young is Kylian Mbappé, a teenager whose footballing story has already been embellished with some massive storylines. He is unfazed by this notion that youth accentuates risk. As it happens – not that anyone is making too much of it at the moment – one of the players whose form has been most wobbly during the World Cup preparations is Hugo Lloris, the captain and one of the group’s elder statesmen.Mbappé enthralled his audience in the week leading up to France’s opening game against Australia when he took centre stage to field questions about how his footballing life took him to this moment. Such is his confidence, his sureness in himself, the risk concept seemed almost alien to him. “We have a young team, yes. But when you watch, you see that we play in Barcelona, Madrid, Paris, Juve, Manchester\u0026nbsp…” he said, going on to list their achievements: Raphaël Varane’s titles with Real Madrid, Samuel Umtiti’s with Barcelona, Paul Pogba’s with Juventus before his record transfer to Old Trafford and so on. “I do not like talking about age. Either we can, or we cannot. If we cannot, we stay in France.”Expectation hovers around him. As a teenager in this environment the scrutiny is bound to be wrapped up in a bit of a commotion. On the spectrum of World Cup teenagers that veers from Theo Walcott to Pelé, Mbappé’s meteoric rise suggests he is expected to chart quite high. For the boy who thrilled at Monaco, who earned the right to create a new‑look attack with Neymar for PSG and with Antoine Griezmann for France while still in his teens, life has moved pretty fast. “I learned to mix with different worlds,” he explains. “Monaco’s was quieter and family friendly. In Paris, it’s a world of superstars. Those are two different things. This allowed me to be able to adapt everywhere, in all circumstances, to be a chameleon. It was rewarding.”He is aware of his own shortcomings and the need to improve in defensive and tactical discipline. “I do not know if I am too harsh with myself. But that’s what makes you grow. I do not have time to watch the videos where I scored, where I dribbled. I’m looking at my defensive videos, the missed opportunities.”Taking part in the World Cup was in Mbappé’s thoughts for a long time. “I thought it was possible. Didier Deschamps had already called young players like Anthony Martial, Kingsley Coman, Ousmane Dembélé. I thought I had to play.” Martial and Coman were part of the Euro 2016 squad, while Mbappé was blasting a trail through the under-19 European Championship. “I told myself: you must believe! We will go to this competition to really exceed our limits. We are a young generation starting to hatch. We appreciate each other. But what can we all do together? That’s the question. We’ll see what we can do.”In a L’Équipe column Bixente Lizarazu, Deschamps’s 1998 World Cup‑winning teammate, noted the “technical complicity” growing between Griezmann and Mbappé. “We are just beginning to get a glimpse of what could be the duo of the summer and this World Cup,” Lizarazu added. “Together, they can hurt a lot.”One of the notable questions about the team’s shape is whether they complete the attack with the zip of another young flyer in Dembélé or the sturdier physical presence of Olivier Giroud. Deschamps seems happy to have the options.There is flexibility in that Mbappé can play wide, as he tends to for PSG, or centrally, interchanging positions with Griezmann, but France are refining the plan to limit overcrowding, to prevent a kind of traffic jam building up if too many players drift into the same patch. “They do have freedom but can’t be all in the centre,” Deschamps said. “We have worked on that. The players choose how they want to use the space.”Deschamps is trying to emphasise the calmness and concentration of the group – all the easier after Griezmann’s filmed announcement of his big decision to stay at Atlético Madrid two days before France’s first game. It was not quite up with Julen Lopetegui’s Real Madrid news for killer timing but not brilliant all the same. Deschamps batted it away as more of a media intrigue than a distraction for the squad, although he was pleased that such an important figure in the team no longer has any worries outside the camp.“He has freed his mind for the World Cup. That’s a good thing for us. The good mood, enthusiasm, life, joy, is not against the seriousness of the work that needs to be done. The young players know that. We don’t want to be too tight. The idea is to be focused, be relaxed and play. We are going to bite into it with all our teeth as if it is a good apple.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9351b049c08c7a42b63c4a047ce5ff5ba978cd1b/1216_232_3718_2232/master/3718.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8df4c810b5735a8114a457fd1f8a141","title":"lionel messi argentina world cup final chance win","story":"“Whenever I have trouble sleeping, I find Messi’s goals on YouTube and watch them on a loop,” the acclaimed Argentinian film-maker Lucrecia Martel said recently. Asked whether they sent her to sleep she said: “They give me peace I\u0026nbsprecover faith.”Many Argentinians derive faith from watching Lionel Messi play: “Messi is the first genius of the 21st century,” Jorge Valdano tells me, “and the last bridge between the street and the academy. If for Maradona the ball was a musical instrument, for Messi it’s a tool which he utilises with a stunning sense of efficacy.”“Messi is two, three players at once,” Javier Mascherano once said, and he recently clarified for me what he means: “Conceptually, Leo does what in other teams you need three players to do: he takes care of creating play, finishing and assisting all at the same time.”Messi’s stats are a testament to this he has surpassed most on goals scored but also in terms of assists. Mascherano thinks the constant improvement makes Messi all the more spectacular: “He is continually in ascendant evolution – year after year he becomes a better player.”On-field genius comes with an off‑pitch low profile that has rendered him enigmatic to say the least. He rarely says much and when he does it is hardly amazing. The writer John Carlin once said that having interviewed Messi twice, if he were offered him again he would refuse. “Shy,” everyone says, and almost as often the reference comes with “not so much shy as introverted”. What is unarguable is that Messi’s savant qualities exist. And that is what is of interest.After Argentina achieved second place at the 2014 World Cup, playing every minute of the tournament with every fibre of their beings, there was a hideous backlash back home dwelling on the mistakes, the could-have-beens, the ifs and the buts. The cross Messi has to bear for being Argentinian but not having won a major trophy for the nation is as unbearable as it is ridiculous.The dichotomy between club and country is the single most referred-to question thrown my way when it comes to Messi, ever since he sat on the bench as an unused substitute in 2006, sulking while Argentina went out to Germany. How come he delivers so much for Barcelona and so little for Argentina? Is it Andrés Iniesta? He doesn’t sing the national anthem was one of the criticisms. And he never played in his own country’s first ision.A perception has been voiced that somehow he is sometimes a ravenous winner (for Barcelona) and other times a disconnected outsider who does not feel the emotion of the strip (for Argentina). The author Andrés Burgo disputes this. “There was never a ravenous Messi and another disconnected one: he was always ravenously disconnected,” he wrote in 2015. That came after the 2014 “fiasco” was followed by Messi leading Argentina to another final, the Copa América, where they lost against Chile.Ravenous, disconnected, introverted and somehow remarkably “one more in the team” and “just a normal guy” – quite a feat for probably the most famous guy in the world. “You’re better known than Coca-Cola,” the political journalist Luis Majul told him a few months ago in an interview aired in Argentina and Messi laughed. Why? Was it the fact itself or the nature of the comparison that cracked him up? Majul asked, as if talking to a child (because interviewers talk to him as if he is a child): “What are you laughing at? It’s true.” The reply was a shrug, an “I don’t know”, some sort of “I never think about myself in those terms” thing.A more recent interview with the popular football programme Líbero visited Messi’s personal museum of balls, trophies and football shirts – the shirts signed by former team‑mates, rivals, legends. He shows off Iniesta’s, the most recent addition: “I never asked him for his shirt before, because I was still enjoying him,” he said now that Iniesta has left Barcelona he dared ask. “You are the number one, there is no one like you,” Iniesta’s message says.Huge efforts from the Messi brand are being poured into highlighting that he gives these interviews to Argentinian media. The view that Messi has matured – now that he is a father – and adopted leadership skills, that he is more sure of himself and dares be who he wants to be, is further illustrated by his relatively new image. “The ornamental beard, so in vogue, so ex‑con,” was the cynical take from the professional social provocateur Esteban Schmidt in Argentina. The Beckham-style tattoos (at least one of which has been removed) present a more masculine, muscular Messi. Gone is the shy antisocial Messi in comes the new leader.“In spite of media efforts to Maradonise him, he really doesn’t pick players, select squads, or dictate formations or lineups,” said a source from within team Messi to counter rumours rife in Argentina. Much was made of the fact that in a friendly against Spain in March, when he asked not to play because of muscle fatigue, he went into the dressing room at half-time to give the pep talk. At Brazil 2014, after an initial defensive formation, apparently Messi sent word to the coach, Alejandro Sabella, that the players weren’t happy, and a more offensive lineup reigned henceforth.We can track rumours of the modus operandi back years allegedly he texted managers with his tactical critique from the bus after a match, seats away from the manager. He is more comfortable texting than speaking. Juan Sebastián Verón claimed that the only time he saw him nervous enough to lose sleep (Messi sleeps on average a couple of hours more than most athletes, including a sacred afternoon nap) was when he had to speak to the squad as captain in 2010. Verón said Messi paced the room they shared anxiously.Messi’s phone is his friend. To the point that on the friendly tour of Manchester and Madrid it was leaked that he sat, head hung low, staring at the screen even at mealtimes that younger players in awe dared not approach. His longstanding osteopath of yesteryear José Brau said: “The way to understand him is to watch his body language: when his head is down it’s as if he was putting up a Do\u0026nbspNot\u0026nbspDisturb sign.”Sometimes his head appears to be low on the pitch and he goes on to score some impossible goal and it is on the pitch that we should observe him. “A genetic miracle,” Fernando Signorini told me. Signorini has worked as a trainer with footballers for as long as he can remember and was in charge of Argentina’s physical coaching at the 2010 World Cup. “Just like Diego, his neuromuscular coordination has a cosmic power. Almost unthinkable ability to control their body in time and space, defying gravity. At maximum speed, he can take two steps with the same leg and the ball. I’ve tried to do it on sand and I couldn’t. Leo and Diego do it routinely, at high velocity, surrounded by the greatest players in the world trying to stop them. That’s how I would define his\u0026nbspgenius.”The challenge then is to create the environment that will best enable him to thrive. Successive Argentina managers have spent inordinate amounts of time not only meeting Messi on regular trips to Barcelona but questioning Pep Guardiola, the coach widely regarded as having got the best out of him. Guardiola is said to have told Sabella: “Speak to him the bare minimum, only when absolutely necessary.”Martín remembers Guardiola showing him video footage he would put in front of Messi accompanied by light hints. “What do you think if we try this?” Or: “It seems to me that we could have an opportunity if we did that\u0026nbsp…”“Suggest,” Guardiola says. And let him be.Jorge Sampaoli has also been briefed by Guardiola. Argentina’s coach seems to be cracking the Messi enigma. Sources close to the footballer say he was very pleased after their first meeting, because they “only spoke about football”. It is in keeping with Guardiola’s stance to stick to the subject.The anguish Messi feels when he loses is clear. The image of him sobbing in the arms of Mascherano after defeat in one final, the surprise retirement from international football after another (he was lured back) are indicative of a frustration bordering on the unbearable.But the absurdity of the burden the national flag represents subjects him to constant backlash – his every utterance turned against him in the most unexpected ways. “Do you feel you owe the World Cup to the Argentinian people,” he was asked. “We owe it to ourselves,” Messi replied.A barrage of manufactured controversy ensued: Messi does not feel indebted to the nation. A traitor, motivated by the deep Qatari-sponsored coffers of Barcelona more than by the glorious emotive weight of the national strip.The sports psychologist Marcelo Roffé, who worked with Messi’s generation of players at youth level, said it wasn’t Maradona who is ill – Argentinian society is ill. “How can a person be psychologically prepared to tolerate the ‘poison’ of success?” he said. “It’s not easy.”Messi has enjoyed his football more with Barcelona. The familiarity with his team-mates and his surroundings notwithstanding, perhaps he really is a creature of habit. He apparently likes order and is himself very ordered Argentina maybe throws just that little bit more chaos his way than he can handle. Unlike Maradona, who thrived on conflict and feeds off opposition, Messi seems to need cooperation in order to succeed. He functions best as part of a well-oiled machine. It’s difficult to match that concept with Argentina, on any level.Plenty of Argentinians are football lovers in the purest sense, content to share the fact that we are from the same country as Messi and satisfied with the joy he has given. “I love you just the way you are without cups or trophies” Alejandro Wall titled a feature-length ode of gratitude, voicing the feeling of millions. But plenty more, and perhaps the media are more guilty of this than most, still feel something is incomplete.Mascherano told me Messi has a conditioning effect on the collective performance. He also believes Messi’s best version depends on the team and Messi seems to echo this, always claiming he wins nothing alone.Maradona won a World Cup for Argentina practically single‑handedly, but at a cost. To himself and perhaps the collective ego of the nation.“This has to be very clearly stated: Messi is not Maradona whether we like it or not,” Roffé has said. “As Argentines, we have done a lot of damage to Maradona. We can’t stop consuming him, as if he was a substance. Let’s hope with Messi we learn to modify our behaviour.”This is almost certainly Messi’s last chance to win a World Cup so the onus and pressure are on the other 22 players. Are they up to the task of helping the genius emerge triumphant? Will anything change if they do? Discussing Messi’s fantastic maturity and fitness level, Sampaoli was asked whether this was “Messi’s World Cup”. He replied: “This one, the next one, and the one after that.” It is not as if he is going to play until he is 50, came the retort from the floor, to which Sampaoli replied: “I\u0026nbspdon’t\u0026nbspknow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/897ae2684c62b8d9b6006855b56bb49e5ed0c6fd/0_149_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7cc54e164064ac41ccc6edf36b677a84","title":"morocco iran world cup group b match report","story":"Even when the World Cup is bad, you absolutely have to watch because something you’ll still be talking about for years could happen at any moment. Unfortunately for Aziz Bouhaddouz Morocco might be discussing his injury-time own-goal, that gave Iran a 1-0 win in this Group B game, for some time to come.After a promising beginning this had turned into a stultifying, bad-tempered game that not many would have remembered. But then at the very last, Ehsan Hajsafi swung a free-kick over from the left, and Bouhaddouz – only on as a second-half substitute – stooped to head past his own goalkeeper. Afterwards he was in tears, and you can’t blame him: he knows he’ll remember this for a long time yet.This was not a game to have a headache at. The Saint Petersburg Stadium, a marooned spaceship of a venue on the edge of the Baltic, wasn’t full, but the noise was something else. From the pre-match soundsystem that Megadeth might have asked to be turned down a notch or two, to the harrowingly familiar din of some vuvuzela-esque horns: let’s just say, it was loud.Hakim Ziyech, the prowling playmaker who has just enjoyed such a brilliant season with Ajax, missed the first real chance of the game – quite literally, in fact, swiping at thin air after a beautifully-worked corner routine found him in space on the edge of the box.Morocco looked much the more threatening side in the opening stages, marrying skill with intensity and so many players – almost too many – looking to swarm forwards and create. They nearly scored after at least three of those men had attempts in a proper goalmouth scramble, while a couple more attacks broke down after their centre-forward Ayoub El Kaabi, all left foot, found himself on the right and checked on to his favoured side, rather than attempt a pass with the other.Amine Harat sashayed through the defence and tried another shot, but to no avail, straight at Ali Beiranvand in the Iran goal. This was a test of everyone’s constitutions as much as it was a football match.Iran’s best chance came a few minutes before half-time: Vahid Amiri drove a huge hole through the Morocco defence with a wonderful pass to Sardar Azmoun, but the striker took a poor touch and stumbled, losing momentum and taking the sting out of his shot, saved by Munir El Kajoui.Just as the impetus was taken out of Azmoun’s effort, so went the whole game after the break. Morocco became more and more frustrating, seemingly developing a team-wide knack for making the wrong decision time after time.So too Iran, whose big threat, Alireza Jahanbakhsh, was anonymous: last season the AZ Alkmaar winger became the first Asian player to ever finish top-scorer of a major European league, but he offered little here.There was a concerning moment with around 20 minutes left, when Watford’s Nordin Amrabat looked like he was knocked out cold, after a shoulder crashed into his jaw.His team-mates gathered around and immediately looked fretful, as for a few seconds Amarabat didn’t move. He eventually got to his feet and tried to come back on, but after staggering around and having to be kept upright by the arms of the physios – who also slapped him on his cheeks to see how he was – sense prevailed and he was replaced by his brother, Sofyan.That injury, then a few minutes later one to Iran’s Omid Ebrahimi, who went off clutching his side, combined to provide a short breather, which in turn sparked a more cohesive spell for the Moroccans.Ziyech popped up in the left channel of the box to direct a decent effort towards the corner, but Beiranvand did well to e and save.As much as anything, credit must be given to the keeper that he managed to retain his concentration after the preceding insipid 30 minutes.It was a brief period of interest, though. A few moments later Ziyech spread a simple pass to Achraf Hakimi on the left flank, but he averted his gaze and let the ball bobble underneath his foot for a throw. A few moments later Ramin Rezaeian, upon receiving a light tap on the shin, gave us a little entertainment with an elaborate series of twists, turns and rolls.By this point it was a game that everyone wanted to be over. But there was one last twist. Bouhaddouz intervened, marking space at the near post, and the Iranians burst with joy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/177cde0aa5fb3a5828b7d1f052afd876d6612652/399_0_2039_1223/master/2039.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c1a235f24a0d2418d6f1baebe2768c5d","title":"morocco v iran world cup 2018 live","story":"An own goal deep in added time gifted all three points to Iran in St PetersburgNick Miller is at the St Petersburg Stadium for the  and was no doubt effing and jeffing to beat the band when Iran bagged their late, late winner. Here’s his on-the-whistle report.So, heartbreak for Morocco. It’s difficult not to imagine that with games to come against Portugal and then Spain, their World Cup is already over. While Aziz Bouhaddouz will be feeling very sorry for himself after scoring that own goal, he’s entitled to wonder what on earth his fellow substitute Sofyan Amrabat was doing giving away such a daft free-kick in that position so late in the game.Player ratings: If you’re reading this report you probably didn’t see the match, but don’t let that stop you getting your player ratings in tout suite.Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeep! It’s all over and ... somehow, Iran have won their first World Cup match since 1998. Their winner came deep into added time and was a gift. Under no pressure of any kind, Morocco substitute Aziz Bouhaddouz put an unstoppable near post header past his own goalkeeper while attempting to defend a free-kick that was needlessly given away by another substitute, Nordin Amrabat.Morocco gifted Iran that winner long after their opponents had shut up shop and clearly settled for the draw. Both sides will be sitting in their dressing rooms in a state of shocked disbelief Morocco wondering how they lost a game they dominated for long periods and Iran wondering how they won a game in which they were dominated for long periods.90+5min: The substitute Bouhaddouz scores past his own goalkeeper with a near post header as he attempts to defend the free-kick taken by Ehsan Hajsafi. That is a horror show! The ball was crossed, there was nobody in an Iran shirt near him and for reasons best known to himself, he sends a bullet header past his own goalkeeper.Unbelievable, Jeff! Iran score in the knockings! It’s an own-goal!!!90+3min: Amrabat 2.0 concedes a free-kick in a dangerous position on the left, between the left side of the penalty area and the touchline. 90+2 min: There’s a bit of a skirmish on the touchline, where Herve Renard and Carlos Queiroz get in a bit of a set-to. Renard’s coaching staff drag him away from the Iran manager, he calms down and offers Quiroz a handshake ... which is accepted. Meanwhile back on the pitch, Iran’s Karim Ansarifard’ has been booked for something or other.90 min: There’ll be six minutes of added time. Iran have clearly settled for the draw in the hope they can beat Portugal or Spain, but Morocco are still trying to win this one.86 min: It’s been a game of two halves in St Petersburg, where the second has been quite flat. A series of injuries and substitutions punctuating the play hasn’t helped, but there seems a distinct lack of urgency from two teams who now seem more interested in not losing the match than they are in winning it. It’s understandable, but ultimately a draw is unlikely to be much use to either side.83 min: Alireza Jahanbakhsh off on a stretcher with cramp, Saman Ghoddos on. 82 min: Morocco substitution: West Ham old boy Manuel Da Costa comes on for Amine Harit. There’s another break in play as Iran’s Jahanbakhsh goes down with cramp.79 min: Hakim Ziyech goes close for Morocco with a sweet strike from 20 yards that forces a very good save from Alirez Berianvend, who puts the ball out for a corner. That’s a great save.76 min: Morocco substitution: Sofyan Amrabat comes on to replace his brother Nordin. Elsewhere in the Morocco ranks, striker Ayoub Kaabi is replaced by Aziz Bouhaddouz.74 min: Bad news for Morocco, as Amrabat is caught by an accidental shoulder from Hajsafi and wallops his head off the ground. He looks very dazed and confused but is anxious to come back on. Thankfully, Morocco’s medical staff opt to take him off despite his protestations.71 min: A truly momentous occasion in this World Cup, as I get my first accusation of bias from a reader for ... describing what’s happening in a football match. “It’s astonishing how bias your reporting toward Iran is!” writes Aarta Alkarimi, who I suspect may actually think I am being biased against Iran. “You can’t even hide it.” It is true that I am fabled for my anti-Iran bias. And now I’ve been rumbled.69 min: For Iran, Jahanbakhsh gets down the inside left but his attempted cross is put out for a corner. Again, the delivery is poor and another decent attacking opportunity goes to waste.66 min: Iran substitution: On a yellow card, their skipper Masoud Shojaei goes off. He’s replaced by Mehdi Tarem. He comes on as his team wait to take a free-kick from deep, which is duly wasted when the ball is larruped high and wide. 63 min: Shepherding the ball out of play near the corner flag, Iran’s Ehsan Hajsafi is challenged from behind by Hakim Ziyech. Hajsafi goes to ground with a roar of pain so loud it can be heard over the din of horns and vuvuzelas. It’s quite the over-reaction from a nothing challenge and Ziyech turns to the ref with a look of bafflement on his face and shrugs his shoulders ostentatiously. 61 min: From a Morocco corner, Iran attack on the break with Alireza Jahanbakhsh on the ball and two men up in support. Morocco get back in numbers at high speed to snuff out the danger.60 min: Little in the way of chances being created in this second half, in a match that remains – not so much on a knife-edge, as hanging in a Dali-esque fashion over the back of a spoon. The first half was a lot more entertaining, but the players seem to be getting more tense the longer it goes on. A goal would spice things up nicely. 56 min: Throw-in for Morocco, deep in Iran territory. From that, Iran win a throw-in of their own and lump the ball forward. Remember, with Spain and Portugal in this group, a draw almost certainly won’t be much use to either of these sides here.55 min: There’s a break in play as Iran’s Omid Ebrahimi receives treatment for a rib injury. 53 min: More good play from Iran, who enjoy a rare period of sustained possession. They lose the ball, however, and it’s Morocco’s turn to attack on the break. Their attack breaks down when Hakim Ziyech is harshly penalised for a handball he couldn’t possibly avoid.50 min: Another promising counter-attack from Iran, who advance up the field with a four-on-four. It comes to naught on the back of a poor final pass.48 min: Another chance squandered by Morocco, as Amine Harit completely miscues a volley at the far post after being teed up by an excellent cross from Amrabat, who has been excellent for Morocco on that right flank.47 min: Iran’s Alrireza Jahanbakhsh picks up a needless booking for stamping on the instep of Hakim Ziyech. 46 min: Play is back under way at the St Petersburg spaceship. Morocco immediately go on the attack, but Amrabat cuts in from the right and sends in a wayward cross with way too much welly on it.Footballers, eh? All about bling and fast cars and fancy clothes. Well, Iran’s goalkeeper is quite the exception. 45 min: We’re into added time of what has been a thoroughly entertaining 45 minutes of football, despite the paucity of goals thus far. It’s been really enjoyable. Having been on the back foot from the get-go, Iran have gradually found their feet and this has evolved from what looked a certain Morocco win, to a very hard game to call.44 min: For Iran, Sardar Azman is played in behind by a nicely weighted through-ball from Jahanbakhsh and finds himself one-on-one with Muniz in the Morocco goal. He gets down and spreads himself and saves with an outstretched foot. That was a fantastic chance for Iran, who have grown into this game and are looking potentially lethal on the counter-attack.42 min: It’s worth noting that this match is being played to the soundtrack of a cacophony of horns above what sounds suspiciously like the low, irritating drone of thousands vuvuzelas. 38 min: From the left touchline, Moroccan winger Hakim Ziyech tries to pick out Ayoub El Kaabi with a wafting cross. It’s a perfect height for the Morocco frontman, but a mite too far in front of him and he fails to make contact despite stretching every sinew. Could he have made more of an effort to fling himself at the ball, there? I thought so.34 min: From the ensuing free-kick, Alireza Jahanbakhsh shoots high over the bar from almost 40 yards. That was an optimistic effort. 34 min: Medhi Benatia loses the ball high up the field and with Iran on the break, Karim El Ahmedi is left with little choice but to clip the heels of Sardar Azmoun.

Yet it doesA while back, in this column, I made a plea for more escapism. I’d been driven round the bend\u0026nbspby the impossibility of having a single conversation with anyone without the subject turning to politics – Trump or Brexit, mainly – and by the mystifying popularity of TV shows and novels with something to say about “the current climate”, when clearly what’s required is a break from that climate. Read swashbuckling adventures or watch period romances instead! When politics is everything, it’s unhealthy indeed, as the philosopher Robert Talisse argues, it’s unhealthy for politics itself. (Constructive political disagreement requires that we start from some shared, non-political common ground, otherwise it’s just a fight to the death.) So did you heed my advice? You did not. Though to be fair, neither did I. And neither, apparently, did the participants in a new study by the neuroscientist Tali Sharot and others, on the troubling phenomenon they label “epistemic spillover”.Hold on, though. Is it true you should trust a\u0026nbspRepublican doctor? (Let’s assume this is a\u0026nbspcontext where moral issues such as abortion don’t arise.) Much of me wants to think so. But part of me can’t help recalling the surveys suggesting most Republicans don’t think humans cause climate change, and\u0026nbspbelieve guns make homes safer. If\u0026nbspyou’ve swallowed those notions, what might that say about your grasp of other scientific data, or your\u0026nbspsusceptibility to believing whatever you like when it comes to,\u0026nbspsay, psoriasis, or skin cancer?The more general point here is that\u0026nbsppolitics, in colonising everything, has come to colonise our perception of the facts, too. And\u0026nbspeven if you disagree with me on climate change or\u0026nbspguns, by the way, the problem remains: perhaps I’m the one labouring under delusions, but either way, we’re arguing not about opinions, but reality itself. In that situation, it’s not necessarily irrational to distrust one’s political opponents on pretty much everything.It’s a vicious circle: it would be better if politics weren’t so tribal, but given that it is – and that this now extends to basic facts – there’s an incentive to start behaving more tribally yourself. After all, if the other side is out of touch with reality, engaging sanely with reality means rejecting their whole worldview, not just their politics. Is it possible to do that without rejecting them as human beings, thereby turning politics into all-out war? I suppose we’ll soon find out.Read this: In her 2017 book We Need To Talk, the American journalist Celeste Headlee investigates why we’re so remarkably bad at listening to other viewpoints, and offers strikingly useful tips for better conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4f4d080009bc1a6545d5b33138111f9cbce3cba8/1035_832_6727_4036/master/6727.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d3f8cdc59545bbfb96642786e2568ae","title":"thomasina miers recipe for poached cherry and chocolate tiramisu","story":"This inauthentic but delicious take on the Italian classic puts fruit centre stageI have a weakness for tiramisu. And much as I love the real deal, I’ve created this inauthentic one to celebrate the fleeting cherry season. Cherries aren’t cheap, but I still buy them the moment they appear in the shops, lest lack of demand eventually sees them off in favour of more easily harvested and therefore more affordable fruit (a lifelong paranoia). Of the original recipe, I have kept the booze-soaked biscuits and creamy mascarpone, to which I’ve added a wickedly rich, dark chocolate ganache and the softly poached fruit.The grassy notes of an unaged tequila go beautifully with dark chocolate and fruit. If you can’t find tequila, brandy will serve you well.170g caster sugar ½ vanilla pod, or ½ tsp vanilla extractJuice from 1 orange and zest from ½ 400g cherries, halved and stoned120ml tequila2 tbsp kirsch3 eggs, separated500g mascarpone20 savoiardi biscuitsFirst cook the cherries. Put 100g of the sugar, vanilla, orange zest and juice in a pan and cook over a gentle heat until the sugar has dissolved. Bring to a simmer, then add the cherries, tequila and kirsch. Cook for a couple of minutes until the cherries are just tender. Pour into a bowl and leave to cool.Meanwhile, beat the egg whites until stiff and set aside. Beat the yolks and the remaining sugar together until they are pale and have at least doubled in volume. This takes three to four minutes, so use an electric whisk to avoid a sore elbow. Now beat in the mascarpone, a third at a time, to avoid lumps. Fold the whites into the mascarpone mix.Now make the ganache: heat the cream in a saucepan until just simmering, turn off the heat and pour it over the chocolate, stirring to melt it. Add two tablespoons of the cherry juices into the melted chocolate.Lay the biscuits out in a shallow, wide dish that is large enough to give you a single layer of biscuits. Drain the remaining liquid from the cherries and drizzle it evenly over the biscuits. Pour over the ganache as evenly as possible don’t worry if it does not completely cover the biscuits. Now spread the mascarpone over the ganache. Cover the bowl with clingfilm and refrigerate for at least six hours, or overnight if easier, but it starts to deteriorate after 24 hours.Dust with a little cocoa powder and bring to the table in all its glory.The poached cherries are delicious with vanilla ice-cream or as an accompaniment to panna cotta you can make them more crowd-friendly by cutting down on the tequila. The ganache can be turned into a delicious chocolate sauce for ice-cream by heating with another 75ml whole milk, a knob of butter and a tablespoon of golden syrup. I always then add one to two tablespoons of unaged tequila – the flavour is just wonderful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/213f02d99a2a5b68f153c8fe087b37b6d2a5670a/0_749_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=748989d9c5b8ef36a1de397009788619","title":"lets move to ipswich suffolk david brent steve jobs","story":"You can – just about – find Ipswichness peeping out, in its burgeoning festival scene or the independent shops and 17th-century gablesWhat’s going for it?

Here, she talks about her decision to go publicAlice Glass’s Los Angeles home is a picture of gothic splendour. Her kitchen resembles a graveyard of dead flowers she is annoyed that her living black lilies never droop when she is looking. There is a fake Goya on the way down to her basement studio, where skulls surround the drums. A spider crawls out of the toilet roll when I use her bathroom. It is probably not part of the decor.Glass is less macabre: there is a tattoo of Bambi on her thigh. She loved the royal wedding. Her voice only rises above its perpetual whisper when she calls to her cats, Mr Peanut and Fuzzy, the alpha who dominates her pit bulls, Jacob and Shadow. She apologises for the boxes that entomb the sofa, merch from her recent debut solo tour. She had polled fans on Twitter to ask which song she should play from the back catalogue of her former band, the anarchic electro-punk duo Crystal Castles, which she quit in October 2014. Ultimately, she decided to play the material to which she still felt connected – “where I’m feeling worthless and hopeless”, she says. It took time in rehearsals to shake off their negative associations.It was not until allegations surfaced against Harvey Weinstein that Glass (born Margaret Osborn) was emboldened to go public with detailed allegations of abuse against her ex-bandmate, Ethan Kath (real name Claudio Palmieri). She felt it was her responsibility, “especially after I had been told he had done similar things to at least one other woman”. Glass had previously alluded to her experience when she released her debut solo single, Stillbirth, in July 2015: “You don’t own me any more,” she shrieked over music that she likened to “being eaten by fire ants”.The song allowed her to speak covertly at a time when she was scared of going outside in case she was served with a lawsuit, she says, claiming that Kath started making legal threats in response to her tweeting stats about domestic abuse fatalities shortly after she announced her departure from the band. Glass says she received cease-and-desist letters from the same firm that represented Bill Cosby, which quoted her tweets and intimated that Glass was making these statements to benefit her career. But seeing other women speaking out about abuse last October was like watching “someone jumping off a cliff”, she says. “If someone goes first, it lets you know that you’re safe. It really put things into perspective. If it wasn’t for them, I’m not sure how long it would have taken me to speak out.”She published a lengthy statement accusing Kath of nonconsensual sex, stalking, manipulation, intimidation and isolation, violence (including being dangled over a stairwell), control and derision. Kath has repeatedly denied Glass’s allegations, describing them as “pure fiction”. He sued her for defamation and issued his own statement: “Alice and I had a long ongoing relationship both personal and professional. When she suddenly left Crystal Castles to handle her mental health issues and substance abuse issues I fully supported her. I will continue to support her quest to wellness but I can’t support extortion, false claims, and accusations put forth after the band attained new success without her.” (She says his comments about mental health and substance abuse are “bullshit”.)Kath’s defamation lawsuit was dismissed in February, as was an appeal in May, in which he was ordered to pay Glass almost $21,000 (£15,800) in legal fees. The lawsuit was rejected under a California statute designed to protect freedom of speech the court did not make any finding on whether Glass’s allegations were true. He remains under investigation by the Toronto police sex crimes unit after complaints from several women, the police service confirmed to the . Glass does not know if he can bring the suit again. “Probably, he’ll try, but it’s not getting in my head,” she says. “I want him to know that he can keep trying to sue me and it’s not affecting me in the way that you think it is, you’re just spending more of your money and wasting more of your life.”In the early 00s, Glass was a teenage outcast in Toronto. She had difficulties with her parents, who agreed that she should move out aged 15 – she will not discuss why. She turned her flat into a squat for fellow punk runaways – “It was always an aspirational dream to live in a community of people that you can trust” – and formed bands. Fetus Fatale played only a couple of chaotic shows, but Kath has claimed he saw one of them and felt he had “discovered a great poet” in Glass. She doubts that she recalls them meeting when she bought his CD after a show. Her statement details what came next: she alleges that he intoxicated and had sex with her while he was sober. “I feel like, for a lot of it, he could have been anybody when I was lost and desperately searching for someone validating to my experiences,” she says.They recorded together, but she says he told her that the results were so poor that they would not be released. They lost touch Kath was in two other bands, “hedging his bets to see which would be the most successful”, says Glass. But then a song called Alice Practice started taking off on Myspace, so named because, according to Kath, Glass’s parts were merely a microphone test. Glass denies this, too, saying that she had written lyrics and melodies. She had no idea the music was online.A small record deal materialised and Glass says Kath encouraged her to quit high school to tour. She had never left Canada and was 18 when they arrived in Britain, where Crystal Castles experienced viral success, miming on the TV series Skins and leading a bratty noise scene. “Moshing with your friends is the best kind of medicine when you’re an aggravated young person,” Glass theorises of their popularity. She had no such community, was unable to connect to fans’ idolisation and felt like a misfit in the scene: “I don’t think that my expression was necessarily taken seriously, because I was a woman screaming in people’s faces.”The media portrayed her as a feral creature: Kath would extol her violent and accidental genius NME dedicated a spread to her knuckles after she punched a man at a festival. It is expected that violence and outlandish behaviour is concomitant with male musical genius. But when volatility is part of a woman’s artistic persona, her work is presented as an accident, rather than a purposeful statement. “It seems like a by-product of trauma or some expression that she’s not completely in control of,” Glass says. She wanted to explain herself – that she was violent at live shows because men groped her. But Kath told her it would be better to remain mysterious, disaffected. “That idea of nihilism leaves you completely open to let people come and take advantage of you.”She felt men came to shows to target her. “Like: ‘She doesn’t care what you do to her, pull her hair, try strangling her with your shirt, grab her around the groin, why don’t you rip her skirt off?’ They were all things that happened to me regularly. When a woman doesn’t really have agency – not doing interviews, having music that seemed unintentional, seeming like a vessel who’s there to fulfil someone else’s idea – then you can treat her not as a person and do whatever you want to her.”Glass began to see herself as abject. She had neither friends – she says Kath restricted her personal relationships – nor family ties. She felt “robotic”, escaping on stage then returning to the bus alone, scared to go out. She claims Kath told her that men liked to gang-rape feminists, dissuading her from sharing her ideals. She was so disconnected from reality that she believed him.Glass says the band’s manager, James Sandom, would lament Kath’s behaviour, but she feels he never offered her genuine support. “He pretended to care and pretended to help me at times – or sometimes would just say whatever it took to keep me working.” She says it took until 2012 for Sandom to acquiesce to her demands for a phone and a credit card. Kath allegedly held her passport and controlled the band’s finances, giving Glass “some money throughout the years, but not a proportionate account ... The ‘joint’ bank account,” she sneers.Last year, Sandom who still manages Crystal Castles – told the Daily  that he could offer “no further insight” into Glass’s accusations: “During our time managing Crystal Castles whilst their professional relationship was occasionally volatile, their personal relationship was never fully clear.” Glass disputed this, posting screenshots of emails in which she told Sandom that Kath had thrown her phone out of a moving car and ripped hair from her head. Sandom’s replies characterised Kath’s behaviour as “domestic abuse” and said he would call the police next time. I tried to speak to him prior to meeting Glass, but he declined, saying he had “nothing but admiration for Margaret” and wished her “the best on the path ahead professionally and personally”.“Fuck you,” she says at Sandom when I repeat this. The sun has dipped we have been talking in the dark. She bolts to look for a cigarette. Minutes later, her boyfriend, the musician Jupiter Keyes, comes upstairs with Glass, who has been crying. “Let me give you some light, OK,” he says, switching a lamp on before going out to buy wine.Glass sits back down and says: “It’s cliched to be somewhat triggered by that, but it’s a little weird that he would still be supporting him. I just don’t even know what to say to that. The amount of … cruelty? It never ceases to amaze me. But it’s not just me – there are people that will continue to suffer because they believe the person who’s telling them they wish them all the best really does. I would rather people like that said: ‘Y’know, she can go fuck herself, I don’t care that this happened to her.’”Glass does not know if Sandom talked to Kath about that incident and she does not think he called the police. She alleges a wider picture of neglect. Glass played on crutches for a year with a fractured ankle and performed through broken ribs and food poisoning. Her behaviour ties in with a pattern of self-abasement, but she says it was encouraged. When she proposed cancelling shows, she says Kath told her they would be sued, that fans would stop coming. It played to her sensibilities: “My entire life was performing, so I couldn’t imagine not being able to do that – it was my identity.”She says she repeatedly tried to quit, but she was told that doing so would be “such a shame, that kind of language”, she says. “It is hard to walk away from a project that you put everything into, especially if you almost believe that you’re being received as an artist by a fluke chance.” Glass says she had to get a lawyer to access her half of songwriting and publishing, and her new management had to lobby Twitter for the account that Kath had registered in her name. She was dating Keyes by the time Crystal Castles were supporting Depeche Mode in September 2013 as they drove away from the last date, she knew it was over.Glass goes to the balcony to smoke, gesturing at her “anxiety table of disgusting old cigarettes”. She is not surprised that Kath continued the band with another young, female singer who looks just like her. She says he would often threaten her with the prospect of a nameless girl waiting in the wings “who’s a better singer and who would put up with a lot worse than I would”. Part of Glass leaving entailed coming to terms with the fact that she probably would not be a musician any more. But after she freed herself she decided to write anyway, even if she did not think anyone would care. They did: she signed to Loma Vista (St Vincent, Iggy Pop), released Stillbirth and, last year, the Alice Glass EP.Her new single, Mine, was written with the songwriter Justin Tranter, who she chose for his work on Justin Bieber’s Sorry. None of Glass’s solo material has been an easy listen – eerie melodies snake around blasts of digital static – but Mine is a profoundly heavy listen, describing self-harm: “Abuse myself till I’m finally mine,” she sings. “That’s how desperate I felt,” she says now.She is more comfortable with people idolising her since she spoke out proud, even. But she still grapples with guilt: after her statement, more women alleged that Kath had abused them as teenagers. It was “surreal and fucked up” to know she was not alone, but equally so to contemplate that “a lot of these women – girls – met him because they were fans of mine. If I didn’t exist, then a lot of those experiences wouldn’t have happened.”Her eyes are glassy again. Easier said than done, but she can’t blame herself for that. “Some people have told me that, too, but in the brief times I got to express myself – this one-dimensional side that’s not a completely true representation – that is destructive. And the people that would feel connected to that are most likely damaged themselves and it’s a breeding ground for creeps. There’s no way not to feel guilty. I’m just gonna have to live with it for the rest of my life.”These days she attempts to think about Kath as little as possible, preferring to try to discern the logical explanations behind how she feels about herself. “Justice is just being able to live my life,” she says. Her left hand bears a fresh tattoo of white roses, to symbolise new beginnings. She repeatedly says that she is lucky to be here, to have a career. “That really is an ideal scenario for somebody like me – a damaged high-school dropout.” But she also knows that she put the work in to get here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2a884d7d1405f614231af32d0b59dfc136030f3/43_203_3350_2010/master/3350.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aecfff07aed40c65de534d965f1379fd","title":"david byrne live review oxford new theatre talking heads","story":"Oxford New TheatreBarefoot and besuited, the Talking Heads frontman delivers an entrancing show of often extraordinary musicAt the end of last year, David Byrne posted a tweet claiming that his forthcoming world tour was “the most ambitious show I’ve done since the shows that were filmed for Stop Making Sense”. On one level, that’s just a smart way to drum up business. If you’re a left-field rock star 40-odd years into your recording career, it never harms to compare your latest work to a high watermark from your glorious past, and the 1984 Talking Heads movie is one of the few concert films in pop history that anyone other than a diehard fan might consider watching: a Jonathan Demme-directed riot of stylised dancing and constantly expanding suits that critic Pauline Kael called “close to perfection” and likened to the work of Jean-Luc Godard.But watching Byrne and his 11-piece backing band barefoot and besuited, you have to concede he also has a point. The show is incredibly ambitious. The musicians – who Byrne is keen to emphasise are playing everything live, without the aid of backing tracks – are in constant motion on a bare stage, no amplifiers or drum risers: the percussionists perform with their instruments around their necks, like a samba band, as does the keyboard player, which makes him look a little like a cinema ice-cream vendor. Their every movement is choreographed, sometimes in a familiar way – Byrne’s performance of Talking Heads’ 1980 hit Once in a Lifetime is clearly based on both its famous video and the opening of Demme’s film, where he flung himself around to the beat of Psycho Killer as if being shot – and sometimes in a manner that’s more puzzling. It isn’t entirely clear why, at one point, Byrne starts rolling up his left trouser leg mid song, but it certainly adds to the general air of otherness.It’s not an approach without risks. A rock show where even the way the backing singers stand between songs is choreographed runs the risk of feeling a little dry, and there are a couple of moments when the band, striding around the stage, all smiles, worryingly resemble participants in a jukebox musical based on Byrne’s oeuvre. But it’s more frequently disarming. The staging of Blind, a dense, writhing track from Talking Heads’ final album, Naked, is both incredibly simple and incredibly effective: the band stand in a line, illuminated by a single, powerful footlight, casting vast, looming shadows at the rear of the stage. The show works best when the precision of the staging chafes against visceral, urgent music, when the setlist delves into Talking Heads’ percussion-heavy, perspiration-soaked Afro-punk-funk zenith: you’re reminded what extraordinary songs Born Under Punches and The Great Curve are, how smartly they melded genres, too funky to feel cerebral.The material from Byrne’s most recent album, American Utopia, is a different matter entirely. Behind the South American percussion battery, the songs often sound like the work of his fellow New Yorkers, indie band the Magnetic Fields, albeit with their dolorous lyrical sarcasm replaced by something more whimsical: “The chicken thinks in mysterious ways.” If the staging can’t convince you that this stuff is the equal of what Byrne was writing in 1980, it can certainly potentiate it. The jarring musical shifts of I Dance Like This, a song quite annoying on record, are brilliantly played up: strobes flare, the dance routine continues unabated during one lengthy silence, the effect charming rather than infuriating.But for all the clever staging, it ends with something basic and powerful. Byrne and band cease the choreography and perform Janelle Monáe’s Hell You Talmbout, a chanted listing black Americans killed by police and vigilantes. It’s both potent and a riposte to anyone who thought American Utopia’s vision of the US might be a little too playful and arch for its own good, given the current climate, and it works: an austere finale to a strange and entrancing evening.• At Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, on 15 June.

Based in an exclusive loft at Hollywood’s legendary Rainbow Bar and Grill, it provided boozy sanctuary to many fellow stars including Ringo Starr, John Belushi, John Lennon, Keith Moon, Keith Emerson, Harry Nilsson and Marc Bolan. Their all-night drinking sessions took place away from the prying eyes of the media and nagging managers. The staff at the Rainbow dubbed the crew the Hollywood Vampires.“Because they only saw us at night and all we did was drink!” Cooper laughs down the line from New York. “I remember it, but the lines are a little blurred. Our lines would all get blurred quite a lot. It just seemed to be the place where everybody ended up.”These days Cooper is plainly doing a lot better than most of his friends, many now departed. A wiry and energetic 70-year-old, he is currently on tour – he’s almost always on tour, but this time it’s with the band he named after the drinking club, formed in 2015 with guitarists Joe Perry (of Aerosmith) and, more intriguingly, Johnny Depp.The roots of this all-star project stretch back to an intimate gig Cooper played at London’s 100 Club in 2011. Both Cooper and Depp were in the city to film Tim Burton’s horror comedy Dark Shadows. Cooper invited the actor to play a few songs and started toying with the idea of forming a covers band to pay tribute to his fallen drinking buddies. Depp and Perry (whom Cooper has known for decades) joined and the band made their live debut at LA’s Roxy Theatre in September 2015. They released their self-titled debut album the same month, featuring three originals among the classic rock covers. Well-received by rock bibles Kerrang! and Rolling Stone, the Vampires were credited with avoiding self-indulgence – though in the age of #MeToo, it remains to be seen whether they’ll pull off another tribute to macho rock-star excess.This month they are packing out Europe’s arenas and working on a second album of entirely original material. Quite how this works with three major stars sharing the spotlight is anyone’s guess, though it sounds as though their egos have found an odd equilibrium. “When we put three alpha males in the band, I did think, ‘Oh man, this could be tough,’” Cooper says. “But there’s never been an argument.”“You’ve got have ego to do what we do,” says Perry, “but with this I’m in a totally different headspace. I can just sit in the corner! It’s fucking great. And Johnny is the real deal, let me tell you.”Depp’s passion for music is well known. In the early 90s he was a member of the (largely unlistenable) alt-rock supergroup P, alongside Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers and Gibby Haynes of Butthole Surfers. In 1997 he played slide guitar on Oasis’s Be Here Now and he has performed with everyone from Marilyn Manson to Shane MacGowan.Allegations of domestic abuse towards ex-wife Amber Heard have affected his career, which was already struggling in the wake of flops like The Lone Ranger and Transcendence. (After Heard accused him of physical and verbal abuse “during the entirety” of their relationship, the couple orced. Heard received a $7m settlement, which she donated to charity, and the couple released a joint statement describing their relationship as “volatile, but always bound by love”.)Meanwhile, recent photos of Depp looking gaunt have prompted speculation that he is unwell. Having been told firmly that questions along these lines will bring the interview to a halt, I ask instead what he gets from rock’n’roll. “My day job is a completely different animal, I suppose,” he says. “What do I get from this that I normally don’t get? I get me!” He laughs. “But when I’m up there on stage with these guys, it’s that feeling I had as a kid. It’s freedom. In movies someone is always telling you what to do, but here I have the freedom that my day job doesn’t allow. Most important, it’s really fucking fun.”Perry is particularly eager to sing Depp’s praises, noting that he first realised that Depp had a talent when he saw him playing acoustic guitar in Lasse Hallström’s 2001 film Chocolat. “Quite often when you watch a movie and someone is playing, you can really tell that it’s not for real,” Perry states. “But he was playing some really cool shit, things I’d never touched on as a guitarist. A lot of actors and actresses have walked our way over the years” – pun presumably intended – “but with Johnny it’s different. There’s a laser focus in his eyes.”“He trades licks with Joe and I’d put him up against any second guitarist out there,” agrees Cooper, with somewhat faint praise. “He needs to prove himself every night and that’s a good thing. It gives him that edge.”Hollywood Vampires’ summer tour ends on 8 July in Rome, after which Cooper and Depp will continue working on their second album. Time will tell as to whether their novelty value will survive, but both are adamant that they’re now taking what was once a bit of fun a lot more seriously.“I think we really found our sound this time I think we just had it by the tail on the first record,” says Depp. Cooper adds: “We’re doing what we keep telling young bands to do: don’t lose the anger in rock’n’roll, don’t lose that edge, don’t mellow out! All of the songs that have been written so far are really raucous rock’n’roll songs. It’s got a lot of attitude to it.”Given how many of the original Hollywood Vampires drinking club members are gone, Cooper ranks as one of the great survivors of rock’s first golden era. Perry too, a former addict, has every reason to be thankful. But only last month, reports emerged of a drunk Depp threatening to attack a crew member on a film set. Could this totem to excess, in some perverse way, be a form of rehabilitation?“What separates survivors from the guys that die?” Depp wonders aloud. “It’s just about having the right people around you, people who care about you, at the right time, to save you from yourself. It’s not a good thing to face on your own,” he says, of alcoholism and addiction, “but some people do. Really, it’s just luck.”“That is definitely true,” Cooper agrees. “There were times when I should’ve been gone. I’m 70 now and I’m in better shape than I was at 28. At 28 I was a wreck. I’d never heard the word tofu in my life. I was trying to live that lifestyle as fast as I could and it was non-stop.” Still, he can’t help romanticising the myth of the male rock star. “You just wrote your songs, ate what you could, drank as much as you can and went off to be a great rock band after…. And we looked good doing it!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ee7bfa5f172af7070849ce303f881f283bb7484f/0_0_4158_2730/master/4158.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026s=57fc1fdb366882f8ef193b7ca1aa69d1","title":"a bruising week in a difficult year for theresa may","story":"The PM went from chaos at the G7 to confusion over Brexit, via an apology for GrenfellWhen Theresa May landed at Heathrow at 7am last Sunday, one of the most critical weeks since she became prime minister almost exactly two years ago had just begun.The arcane nature of the wrangling over the precise way parliament can have a meaningful vote on a Brexit deal without actually binding the government’s hands can be misleading. It may look like a obscure trial by textual analysis. But it is being described as high noon for Brexit.After the overnight flight from the near-farcical G7 summit in Quebec, May went straight to the Sunday church service in her Maidenhead constituency before sitting down to prepare for the week ahead.The importance of the two days of votes on Lords amendments had been highlighted the previous week when Boris Johnson was recorded warning that Brexit would happen, but not necessarily in the right way. “The risk is it will not be the one we want and the risk is that we will end up in a sort of anteroom of the EU, with an orbit around the EU, in a customs union and to a large extent in the single market.”The sense of an impending watershed lay behind some reports in the pro-Brexit press of plots to unseat the prime minister as soon as the withdrawal bill is on the statute book. Then the focus will be on shaping Britain’s future relations with the EU and the rest of the world. That is why a meaningful vote on the final deal is so critical.In next Wednesday’s vote on the amendment, Brexiters believe May has offered enough to split the rebel camp. But neither faction knows for sure. The numbers on each side as well as the actual outcome will establish where the parliamentary majority lies.Brexit dominates May’s in-tray, but she wants her record to stand for more. One priority in the past few days has been to repair the self-inflicted damage from her fumbling response to the Grenfell Tower fire a year ago, in a week unlikely to be surpassed for awfulness. She signed off an article for the London Evening Standard apologising for getting it so wrong. It was published on the eve of the first anniversary.On Monday she answered an hour of questioning from MPs on the G7 summit. Her closing sentiments could have applied as much as to the week ahead of her as to the summit. “This was a difficult summit with, at times, some very candid discussions, but the conclusion I draw is that it is only through continued dialogue that we can find ways to work together to resolve the challenges we face.”On Tuesday, as the resignation of Dr Philip Lee, a junior justice minister, stoked speculation that she was facing a real prospect of defeat, May chaired cabinet. As soon as it ended, the first of two days of debates on the EU withdrawal bill began – including the amendment that Brexiters had set out to portray as an attempt to stop Brexit happening at all and frustrate the will of the people.While Dominic Grieve, the rebels’ negotiator, publicly bargained in the chamber with the solicitor general, Robert Buckland, only a few feet away in her office behind the Speaker’s chair, May was desperately trying to fend off defeat by pledging further talks on the amendment.May is inscrutable in meetings, her face impassive. It can be an effective device in the short term, allowing people to believe they have got what they want.The MPs emerged confident that they had a deal on a meaningful vote. A government defeat was averted.But as May returned to Downing Street to host a reception for Grenfell survivors, her official spokesman cast doubt on the concession the rebels had claimed. Nothing more than talks had been promised, he said.It was not just the confusion over what might have been said that indicated the fragility of May’s position as she prepared for prime minister’s questions on Wednesday. That morning the  reported that her Home Office legacy was being unpicked by her successor but one, Sajid Javid, and Jeremy Hunt, the health secretary. After eight years of nailed-down controls on visas for skilled workers, the ceiling on the number of visas available for doctors and nurses would be lifted.Then on Friday, she abandoned two years of opposition to a substantial increase in spending on the NHS. She conceded an increase for the health service but in a further sign that she cannot always get her way in cabinet, the chancellor, Philip Hammond, has still not signed off on a final deal.In a year when it has often seemed that things could not get worse, this has been a bruising week. She has succeeded in reversing all 15 of the Lords amendments but some victories came at a heavy cost. The meaningful vote will be back on Wednesday. This week’s losers now feel betrayed. Dr Sara Wollaston, one of a longstanding group of Tory rebels, is not alone in talking of betrayal and arguing that the bad faith makes it more likely that the government will be defeated.“Goodwill has been very badly undermined,” she said on Friday. “However that matters far less than the final Brexit deal which will have a profound influence on people’s lives.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a65bf36f4f7b56be1922735c62bc8a4eb569756c/0_139_4174_2505/master/4174.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a13fdaf7264c3b874a3d78c10ccfcd01","title":"labour live festival jeremy corbyn clean bandit","story":"Ticket prices have been slashed and there have been problems with the beer, but the party still has its star performerIt was intended to build on that 2017 Glastonbury moment, when tens of thousands of people chanted “Oh Jeremy Corbyn” in an outburst of post-election euphoria. But with Labour Live – the party’s attempt at running a music and politics festival, one year on from the Glastonbury love-in – organisers will just be hoping a few thousand people turn up and the rain holds off.Insiders say more than 3,000 of 20,000 tickets have been sold, though the party won’t confirm this. The trade union Unite has been giving away tickets just to ensure a decent crowd at the White Hart Lane recreation ground in Tottenham, north London, on Saturday.In a week in which Theresa May has faced incessant battles to force Brexit though the parliament, Labour staffers talk of little other than the prospects for Labour Live, with its success or otherwise being seen within the party as an indicator of whether Corbyn’s popularity has peaked. One senior party employee said that while the idea – the brainchild of the MP Ian Lavery – was well intentioned, the leader’s team was too optimistic, declining to take on expert help and, particularly, refusing to allocate enough funding. “There was just this belief that artists would perform for free like they do in election campaigns for the good of the Labour party, but this has none of the intensity of a campaign,” one said. Key figures in the party, led by Corbyn’s all-powerful chief of staff, Karie Murphy, have a fight on their hands to ensure the event is seen as a success. They secured a badly needed coup on Thursday when Clean Bandit were announced as headliners and ticket sales have picked up somewhat since. Up to then the best-known act had been the indie group The Magic Numbers. Well-known Corbyn supporters, the band were among those who appeared in support of the Labour leader at a rally in Birmingham where thousands gathered last June before the general election.The difficulty in attracting high-profile acts had hampered ticket sales for months and sources say at one point in the spring Labour seriously considered cancelling the event. They decided not to after it was said at a crucial meeting that grime artist Stormzy had been booked. That turned not to be the case, and while hasty attempts were made to secure his presence it did not prove possible. Reports that he had demanded a £100,000 fee have been denied by the party. It even proved difficult for Labour to book party stalwart Billy Bragg due to his tour commitments Bragg already had a gig booked in Kent on Saturday night. Labour Live’s first acts are due on the main stage shortly after noon. There will be turns from local MPs David Lammy and Kate Osamor, the party’s general secretary Jennie Formby, and Corbyn himself, who is due on at 5.30pm after an introduction from the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Corbyn will be followed by The Magic Numbers, while “original Sex Pistol” Glen Matlock and Reverend and The Makers due on later.Ticket prices were slashed from £35 to £10, while Corbyn got more involved in an attempt to recreate the 2017 election spirit. He told the Fire Brigades Union annual conference in Brighton last week: “We have new types of political events such as the Labour Live festival. It will have musicians, speakers, activists, trade unionists all coming together in one place … to learn from each other … but also to enjoy ourselves while reflecting on how far Labour has come as a movement.” Although not everybody in the audience was convinced. A constant stream of leaks from inside Labour have not helped. Party sources said the festival’s drinks supplier – the Workers Beer Company – was refusing to supply beer kegs as it didn’t think there would be enough people to justify them. Organisers were said to have “gone to war” with the company, though it remains to be seen whether revellers will be served draft beer or bottles and cans.Event costs could be as high as £1.4m, though the exact figure is a closely guarded secret and will not be known until the event is over. Insiders at Unite and Labour have said the trade union is underwriting most of the costs, though neither the party nor the union will comment.Unite’s general secretary, Len McCluskey, is due to appear at the festival’s “solidarity tent” for People’s Question Time, while his union is also sponsoring a hip-hop karaoke event, challenging attendees to “prove you are better at karaoke than they are!”, and an ice cream van, which will carry the slogan “Ice cream lovers of the world – unite” and play a jingle version of The Red Flag. A Labour spokesperson said that the party “couldn’t say right now” whether it would repeat Labour Live in the future. “We thought it worth trying as Glastonbury isn’t on this year. We’ll see how it goes.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70f5984b7d04194f0888dbbd9f14ff8854bb7f1c/0_133_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6477169b7c0307190efc27faeaa5c545","title":"720m large hadron collider upgrade could upend particle physics","story":"Collider will be far more sensitive to anomalies that could lead to entirely new theories of the universeA massive project to supercharge the world’s largest particle collider launched on Friday in the hope that the beefed-up machine will reveal fresh insights into the nature of the universe.The 950m Swiss franc (£720m) mission will see heavy equipment, new buildings, access shafts and service tunnels installed, constructed and excavated at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at Cern, the particle physics laboratory on the edge of Geneva.The vast machine, which occupies a 27km circular tunnel under the French-Swiss border, hunts for signs of new physics by slamming subatomic particles together at close to the speed of light. In compliance with Einstein’s law Emc2, some of the energy of impact is converted into new matter.The upgrade will make the collider far more sensitive to subtle quirks in the laws of physics, and physicists hope these anomalies will prise open the door to entirely new theories of the universe.In 2012 physicists on the LHC announced the discovery of the Higgs boson, which had leapt into the most fleeting existence inside the machine’s detectors when bunches of hydrogen nuclei, or protons, were crashed into one another billions of times over. The discovery earned a Nobel prize for Peter Higgs and the Belgian physicist François Englert for their theoretical work on the particle in the 1960s.If the upgrade goes to plan, the proton beams in the souped-up accelerator, known as the high-luminosity LHC, or HL-LHC, will be so intense that the number of collisions in the machine will be five to 10 times greater than today.“The high-luminosity LHC is where we will collect most of our data, and in that sense it is the phase of our exploration that lets us find out most about the universe,” said Tara Shears, a professor of physics at Liverpool University who works on the collider’s LHCb detector. “If the LHC so far has given us a candle to illuminate what was previously unseen, the high-luminosity LHC will let us shine a searchlight.”Physicists are already exploring some strange signals at the LHC that could be the first hints that the so-called standard model of particle physics is about to break down. The standard model is a series of equations that describe how particles such as the electrons and quarks found inside atoms interact with each other. The theory works brilliantly, but physicists know it is incomplete: it says nothing about gravity, or the dark matter that clings unseen to galaxies, or the dark energy that drives the expansion of the universe, or why the world around us is made of matter instead antimatter.The curious signals seen that the LHC in recent months are too tenuous to convince most physicists that they are real, but if they strengthen over time, as happened with the Higgs boson, they could reveal the existence of completely unexpected new particles, dubbed leptoquarks or Z primes.To ramp up the number of collisions at the LHC, engineers will fit powerful magnets to squeeze the protons into finer, more dense beams. They then plan to fit devices called crab cavities that use an electromagnetic pulse to give bunches of protons a little sideways kick as they enter the LHC’s detectors. This makes the protons rotate a smidgen the moment before they strike protons coming the other way, which drives up the number of collisions. They are called crab cavities because they make the proton bunches move sideways, even if the rotation is minuscule.“It’s a very exciting time,” said Rob Appleby, a particle physicist at Manchester University and UK spokesperson for HL-LHC. “It opens the door to the most precise and sensitive era of fundamental physics we’ve ever had.”The upgrade is expected to take eight years. While new magnets and beam instruments will be installed when the LHC is switched off for two years in 2019, most of the required equipment will be fitted in a longer shutdown from 2024 to 2026, when the revamped machine will switch back on again.“If the anomalies we see in the LHC at the moment manifest in the next couple of years, which they may well do, what we’ll be looking at with the high luminosity-LHC is the physics underlying those discoveries,” said Val Gibson, a professor of physics at Cambridge University who also works on the collider’s LHCb detector. “That would turn the standard model on its head. It would be totally groundbreaking.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/caa8914ec4bb7893af80141bdf39b82391b7d8e0/0_102_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e5637a27f722916a2fe7dcd448e9629","title":"stephen hawking ashes interred westminster abbey","story":"Luminaries from academia and science pay tribute to the late physicist’s incredible legacy“We remember Isaac Newton for answers,” said Prof Kip Thorne. “We remember Hawking for questions.”For 40 years, physicists have pondered the questions raised by Prof Stephen Hawking’s work, and perhaps his greatest legacy is not his remarkable discoveries, but the impact of his work on future theories of physics. Thorne, a Nobel prize-winning physicist, paid tribute to his friend Hawking by saying that future scientists would not stand on the shoulders of giants, as Newton had it, but “on the shoulders of Hawking”.Hawking’s remains were buried on Friday beneath a sunlit arch, between those of Darwin and Newton, at a memorial service at Westminster Abbey. In an example of the public affection held for Hawking – giant of science, best-selling author, pop culture icon – 27,000 people had applied to attend the event, from which 1,000 were picked. Among them were schoolchildren, and students from colleges for people with special educational needs. “He was a great scientist,” said Jack Smith, 21, a student at National Star College in Cheltenham, before the service, speaking with the same kind of voice device used by Hawking. “He was a great role model that inspired me to use my voice,” added another student, Rose Brown, 20. “It will be sad but it is an honour to be here.” Benedict Cumberbatch, who played Hawking in the 2004 BBC drama, took to the Abbey’s Great Lectern to read the first lesson from the Book of Wisdom. He read it beautifully – straight-backed and sincere, not a performance. God, we were told, gave us “unerring knowledge of what exists, to know the structure of the world and the activity of the elements the beginning and end and middle of times”. Hawking might not have agreed. “I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail,” Hawking once said. “There is no heaven or afterlife for broken-down computers that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark.”Next to Cumberbatch, a sign language interpreter enthusiastically signed “the constellations of the stars”, her face beaming, hands above her head. It was a highlight of this wonderful, inclusive thanksgiving service. A guide dog lay on the cool stone floor across the aisle.It was Lord Rees, the astronomer royal and decades-long friend and Cambridge colleague of Hawking, who addressed the religion issue. Hawking, said Rees, was interested in “learning the mind of God” he shared Darwin’s “agnosticism”, Rees said diplomatically, “but it’s fitting that he too should be interred in this national shrine.”At its most affecting, this was a celebration of Hawking’s humanity. Thorne described Hawking as “by far the most stubborn friend I ever had” to a ripple of laughter. Tom Nabarro, who broke his neck in an accident in 2008, spoke of how supportive Hawking had been as Nabarro adjusted to his circumstances. “He made sure to share his love of life. Stephen showed how we should always expect the best for one another.” Nobody could have failed to have been moved when he said his son, born only hours after Hawking died in March, carried the great man’s name.Rees spoke of Hawking’s determination after being diagnosed with the degenerative disorder amyotropic lateral sclerosis. He was told he might not live long enough to finish his PhD. “He later said ‘everything that happened afterwards was a bonus’,” said Rees. Hawking had triumphed with a “great crescendo of achievement”, but just as compelling was his description of Hawking’s home life. There was a nod to his celebrity and “razzmatazz”. Tribute was also paid to his “forceful political opinions”, most recently about the importance of protecting the NHS “for which he acknowledged he owed so much”.And his place within science history is assured. With his work on black holes in the 70s, Rees recounted how the soon-to-be Lucasian professor of mathematics discovered “the first firm link between two overarching 20th century theories – quantum theory and Einstein’s theory of relativity”. “Forty years later, its ramifications cause more sleepless nights than any physics paper in history,” Rees said with a smile.Hawking’s ashes were interred to the beautiful, otherworldly sound of Westminster Abbey’s choir, watched by Hawking’s family, who laid flowers. Later, Hawking’s words, set to music by Vangelis, were beamed to the closest black hole.With his ashes buried beneath a stone inscribed with his earth-shifting equation, we were reminded not just how radiant Hawking was but how radiant he always will be."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/61af2dc80abf34178e8348d2a32fa88f8ade1b52/0_112_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3079407d99dbce7756d1a6ebb5bdf074","title":"soundscape ecology with bernie krause science weekly podcast","story":"Do you know what noise a hungry sea anemone makes?

However the OECD found that the poorest Britons are more likely to escape poverty than those on low incomes in France and Germany, where it takes six generations to reach the average national income.France and Germany, which have a social mobility ranking above the OECD average, buck the trend in the report – A Broken Social Elevator? How to Promote Social Mobility – for those countries with the highest inequality to also have the lowest social mobility. To further illustrate the lack of social mobility across the 24 countries assessed by the OECD, one in three children with a low-earning father will stay trapped on low earnings, while most of the other two-thirds will only move one rung up the income scale during their lifetime.“Too many people feel they are being left behind and their children have too few chances to get ahead,” said Gabriela Ramos, OECD chief of staff. “We need to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to succeed, especially the most disadvantaged, and that growth becomes truly inclusive.”For several decades the OECD has called on governments to measure inequality on a broader scale than just income and wealth. It has accused governments of failing to address widening health gaps, a ergence in skills and educational opportunities and the failure to bridge the ide between school and employment for those who leave education with few qualifications.The report recognised that in absolute terms, almost everyone in OECD countries had seen an improvement in living standards and life chances than previous generations, with greater access to higher levels of education, healthcare and better paid employment.But while income mobility was a reality for many people born between 1955 and 1975 from low-educated parents, it has stagnated for those born after the mid-1970s.The OECD said governments needed to do more to increase investment in education, particularly at an early age, while “access to good quality, affordable housing, as well as transport, and improved urban planning also help reduce regional ides and concentrations of disadvantaged households in cities”. Nine years ago in the wake of the financial crash the organisation joined other international agencies in urging governments to cut spending and reduce debts, but in recent years has called on them to use their borrowing power to put in place measures that reduce inequality and improve social mobility.Alan Milburn resigned last December as the government’s social mobility tsar after he accused the prime minister of failing in her pledge to build a “fairer Britain”.Milburn, a former Labour cabinet minister, said: “Whole communities and parts of Britain are being left behind economically and hollowed out socially. The growing sense that we have become an ‘us and them’ society is deeply corrosive of our cohesion as a nation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46e18371c114fb60ca92126ba31495a52e7363a3/0_84_3170_1903/master/3170.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a62476f1673ee812208dee9c28be885","title":"england v south africa third womens odi live","story":"Frustration for Jones who had been looking fluent.A bowling change, Masabata Klaas replaces Kapp for her first bowl of the series. She’s a muscular looking bowler, with a smooth run up and closely cropped dyed red hair. She took a career break after having her baby, has come back and is now juggling cricket, babies and studying project management at University.A wide one is thrashed to the boundary by Jones, the more fluent of the England batters so far today.A maiden and Kapp beats Beaumont’s edge again, this isn’t the start England were dreaming of. At the same stage, South Africa were 22 for 1.A super bit of fielding by the South African’s captain prevents a drive from Jones going to the boundary, but then Ismail spoils her figures. She bowls a loose one and it is received gratefully by Jones, who pulls her with a crack to the boundary for four .The pitch, which apparently is naked of grass, it is not proving easy for England to bat on either. A bounday off Kapp, but not a convincing one, an outside edge by Beaumont flies in the gap between keeper and first slip. They then move closer together.Ismail continues to make things difficult for the batters - just a single from that one. She’s not giving England any width to play with and seeming to have no difficulty with Canterbury’s notorious double slope. Beaumont still not timing the ball very well here, balls being regularly chopped into the pitch. Umphph! Kapp skilfully moving the ball this way and that, one squeezes between Beaumont’s bat and pad, then she plays and misses, then nearly chops the ball into the stumps. That hand was Kapp’s.Ah, that was gorgeous. Jones clips Ismail off her toes to deep midwicket for a boundary.Kapp is lovely to watch, smooth run-up, liquid action. England struggling to get her away on what is a slow start at Canterbury. But oh, it looks lovely, lots of happy spectators in breton t-shirts sipping glistening glasses of white wine.A tight line by Shabnim Ismail - Beaumont not able to let loose, no big shots, just a squeeze down to third man and a frustrated hike into the grass. Beaumont off the mark with a whacky uncontrolled edge off Marizanne Kapp, but Jones looking smooth with a purring drive through extra cover for four.A tightish over from Shabnim Ismail. A leave, a prod, a back-foot drive to mid-off then Jones gets the innings going with a flick to midwicket for a couple.And the players walk out with the shadows long: if England win it will be their first series win since the World Cup. If South Africa win, it will be their first series win over England ever.A picture of happiness after a bit more Sarah Taylor magic behind the stumps.A little shout out to 19-year old Laura Wolvaardt, who in the course of her sloth-like 64 broke one of Stephanie Taylor’s batting records. It was her 12th international fifty, and no teenager has ever made more.Really so lovely to see all the kids at the ground in Canterbury - boys and girls. Thirty years ago, big groups of young boys just wouldn’t have been thrilled, or at least admitted to being thrilled, about watching women play cricket. Huge changes in the way women’s sport is perceived, and it is wonderful to see.The pundits on Sky are united in thinking the momentum is with England. “It’s not been clinical but they’ve done enough” says Ebony Rainford-Brent. “When they looked to take it to England, they made it look easy but too many lost opportunities for South Africa,” says Charlotte Edwards.The early wicket of Lizelle Lee, the bowling of Sophie Ecclestone the huge shots of Dane van Niekerk and England’s sloppy catching the talking points. Hello everyone. Well, that was fun! What started off as an old-fashioned slow stodge, turned into something a lot more fancy as South African captain Dave Van Niekerk moved through the gears, stumped just five short of her maiden ODI hundred with another bit of magic from Sarah Taylor, and then subsided into lumpy custard as South Africa lost 3 wickets on 212 and then 3 wickets on 228. Eighty-four for 2 at half way became 156 for 2 from 40 overs which finished off at 228 for 9. Will it be enough, on a warm day at lovely Canterbury, with Heather Knight talking of how 300 is now what England aim for? And a score in the 270s being the average here in county games? We watch and wait: England will have to bat as the dew falls and settles, against the tasty South African seamers, and South Africa may find that their catches stick – which England’s definitely didn’t.England need 229 to win the series. Simple. Right? They had the visitors in a bind for a long while, not passing 100 until the 32nd over. But then the captain, van Niekerk, got busy in the batting power play. She really deserved three figures but Taylor cut her off five runs short with a brilliant stumping off Brunt. Wolvaardt’s half-century was the base that DVN launched but failed to really get going. For England, Ecclestone was outstanding across two spells, finishing with 125. That they dropped four catches (by my count), though, will be the talking point. Right, I have to change gears and write a report of that innings so I will hand you over to Tanya Aldred. Enjoy the chase. Bye! Taylor fumbles but gets the bails off just in time to give Marsh a second wicket. South Africa bowled out one delivery short of batting out their overs. It was that kind of innings.Tip and run, no chance. Not pretty cricket. “It was so bad that Heather Knight had time to drop the ball before throwing it in,” notes Henry Moeran on TMS. Two balls to go. Tries to take two on Brunt’s arm at midwicket but doesn’t make it back, Taylor grabbing the bails. Fair enough, gotta run in that situation in the final over.49th over: South Africa 226-7 (du Preez 16, Ismail 5) Brunt gives du Preez a boundary ball first up and she takes full advantage through the legside. More runs available in that direction later in the over off the pads, but another good ing stop keeps it to one. Ismail chips over long-off for a couple then a single behind point to keep the strike for the final over. Ten from it, Brunt finishing with 352. 48th over: South Africa 216-7 (du Preez 10, Ismail 1) Ismail probably didn’t have her pads on five minutes ago but she’s batting now. A single to cover gets her away. du Preez has to draw on her experience to finish the good work of her captain. She sweeps hard across the line down towards midwicket but Jones makes a very nice ing stop to prevent a boundary. Four runs and the wicket from it. Perfect for England.Three wickets fall on 212! Kapp goes first ball, returning a catch to Laura Marsh who takes it in her follow through. Never easy, nicely done.Two wickets in the Brunt over and three in the spell, the attack-leader has done the job. Luus misjudges a crossbat swipe from the slower ball, an easy catch taken in the deep. Sarah Taylor legside stumpings dot tumblr dot com. Goodness me, she is something else. It is a wide down the legside and the superstar wicketkeeper does the rest. DVN robbed of a maiden ODI ton but the captain has got her team into this contest. 46th over: South Africa 204-4 (van Niekerk 95, du Preez 2) Shot! van Niekerk into the 90s with a wonderful cut through point after making room for herself. It is off-spinner Marsh sending them down, having replaced Shrubsole who took some tap in her second spell. The 200 is up with the stroke too. Singles for both gives DVN another chance and takes two on Jones’ arm at long-on. Within one strike of a maiden century. Brunt is back for the death overs and it has worked. Tryon steered a full delivery to the third man rope early on but Brunt had her caught on the long-on rope by Jones, who has had an eventful day in the field, to finish off. Six runs and the wicket of a player who can smash it huge, England will take that.44th over: South Africa 191-3 (van Niekerk 87, Tryon 14) van Niekerk’s turn! Three boundaries in the over off Shrubsole, who is under real pressure now. Should have seen the back of her first ball, though, Amy Jones completely misjudging the catch at the long-on boundary. That’s the second chance she has put down today. DNV thumps it to the same spot next but wide of the fielder this time - four more! Then, the best of the three, inside-out after using her feet, picking the gap at extra cover. Delightful hitting from the captain who now has her highest score in ODIs. Deserves a ton.43rd over: South Africa 179-3 (van Niekerk 75, Tryon 14) Boom! BOOM! Two sixes in a row from Tryon, over backward square leg, to belatedly get this party started. Has a wonderful record of late against England and is doing her job again. Elwiss recovers well to give up just a couple of singles from the second half of the over, but 15 from it makes it (by far) South Africa’s best this afternoon.42nd over: South Africa 164-3 (van Niekerk 73, Tryon 1) Tryon tries to get Ecclestone away but cannot, finishing her day with a beautiful set of hard-spun, well-flighted deliveries from round the wicket. Just one run from it. She finishes with 10-1-26-1 after being taken for 30 off her first three overs at Hove. Half a dozen of the England players run up to congratulate her. Fantastic young talent. 41st over: South Africa 163-3 (van Niekerk 72, Tryon 1) Earlier in the over, van Niekerk smacked Elwiss back over her head for four but they weren’t able to find the rope a second time, Tryon off the mark then nearly run out last ball in a mix up.Nice work from Knight to get Elwiss back on, into the book with Wolvaardt miscuing a slower ball to mid-off where Shrubsole does the rest. After three dropped catches, they’ve finally held onto one. The opener’s 64 came from 100 deliveries so her dismissal might be well timed for the visitors as it brings the huge-hitting Tryon to the middle, elevated up the list for happy hour.40th over: South Africa 156-2 (Wolvaardt 64, van Niekerk 66) Ecclestone into her eighth, continuing to throw the ball up then spit it through. Bowls with such wonderful control. Three singles, all to the sweepers on the posh side. Can’t do much more than that.39th over: South Africa 153-2 (Wolvaardt 63, van Niekerk 64) This partnership grows towards three figures, van Niekerk striking a pair of boundaries off Brunt as the captain overtakes the opener. It has been a very good power play so far, 30 taken from the four overs of it so far. The skipper keeps the strike as they take a drinks break.38th over: South Africa 144-2 (Wolvaardt 63, van Niekerk 55) Ecclestone is back with three overs remaining in her day. She’s been the best of the bowlers, for mine. Oooh and nearly slips one through the gate of van Niekerk that doesn’t turn. Should have been four from the over but the spinner threw back at the South African skipper’s stumps in her follow though, it hits the stumps and an overthrow is taken. 37th over: South Africa 139-2 (Wolvaardt 61, van Niekerk 52) Brunt is back now. Handy to have five of her overs to draw opn as van Niekerk goes up the gears. Was a good return to the crease until the last ball where Wolvaardt clipped a misdirected delivery down to the backward square leg boundary. Actually, that’s just about off middle stump. Top shot. Her first four since the fifth over.36th over: South Africa 132-2 (Wolvaardt 55, van Niekerk 51) Heeeere comes Dane van Niekerk! After three dors to begin the captain launches BIG over midwicket for six. Next ball, she brings up her 50 with a bottom edge that runs away for two. 76 balls to reach the milestone with four boundaries before that six - the first of the South African innings. Nine scored from the Shrubsole over and van Niekerk again keeps the strike. Her second 25 runs came in 19 balls, TMS again tells me. 35th over: South Africa 123-2 (Wolvaardt 55, van Niekerk 42) Elwiss again at Wolvaardt, who continues to play carefully. After half an over of dots, she drives one down the ground. Will van Niekerk go again? Not this over, cutting to Wyatt at backward point then digging a well-directed yorker to midwicket for one. So she’ll keep the strike at least. Wolvaardt hasn’t hit a boundary for 75 balls, Phil Long says on TMS. Wow. 34th over: South Africa 121-2 (Wolvaardt 54, van Niekerk 41) Shot of the day so far, van Niekerk hitting Shrubsole straight back over her head. That’s what they need, here comes the captain. Then four more later in the over, a little edge that could easily have ended up finishing her innings instead making it to the rope. Two fours in the over: livin’ la vida loca.33rd over: South Africa 113-2 (Wolvaardt 54, van Niekerk 33) van Niekerk lofts the first ball of the new Elwiss over for four! Only the fifth boundary in 33 overs. Three singles and a wide makes eight from the set, the equal biggest of the day for the South Africans who really need to get moving here. 32nd over: South Africa 105-2 (Wolvaardt 53, van Niekerk 27) Shrubsole is back with half of her overs still to be bowled. The opener had it hooping around deluxe earlier today, claiming Lee and conceding just nine runs. Not quite so frugal here, six taken around the sweepers from the incumbent pair.31st over: South Africa 99-2 (Wolvaardt 51, van Niekerk 23) Another dropped catch, this time Knight at cover down low. The third chance given up in the field. Wolvaardt gets the life. Elwiss doing a great job for her captain though, giving just two singles away in this over. 31 overs into the innings and South Africa yet to raise their 100, with plenty of overs from England openers still up their sleeve. 30th over: South Africa 97-2 (Wolvaardt 50, van Niekerk 22) Ecclestone has never bowled better than this for England, I’d venture. van Niekerk is trying to get busy, but just can’t. 7-1-17-1 the spinner’s analysis so far. 29th over: South Africa 94-2 (Wolvaardt 50, van Niekerk 19) Elwiss replaces Knight, who had 15 taken from her three overs. The medium pacer bowled quite nicely at Hove, I thought, after not getting a bat. She’s right on the money here too, van Niekerk unable to score until the final ball of the delivery, driving one to long-on. Can’t fault them here.28th over: South Africa 93-2 (Wolvaardt 50, van Niekerk 18) Ecclestone continues her stoush with these two, Wolvaardt stroking down to long-off later in the over to raise her half-century! She’s been far from rapid with only two boundaries but has ticked the board over consistently enough. 78 balls it took her to reach the milestone her 12th half-century and she’s only 19 years old age. TMS tells us that she has now made more ODI 50s than any teen ever has. Go you good thing. 27th over: South Africa 89-2 (Wolvaardt 48, van Niekerk 16) Plenty of singles on offer down the ground off Knight, the batsmen obliging five times in the over. But while boundaries are being denied the captain may as well keep herself on.26th over: South Africa 84-2 (Wolvaardt 45, van Niekerk 14) Ecclestone mixing up her speeds expertly, prompting a little premeditated lap that is dropped by Beaumont at short fine leg! It was in her hand but as she went back it fell out. She went up very early. It’s an excellent over from the youngster, a maiden. Should have been a wicket maiden. She has 110 from her five overs. 25th over: South Africa 84-2 (Wolvaardt 45, van Niekerk 14) They’re hammering through these overs, half the innings bowled in 85 minutes. On this occasion, Knight has singles taken from four of her six deliveries. That’d probably suit both teams.  24th over: South Africa 80-2 (Wolvaardt 43, van Niekerk 12) Ecclestone drawing van Niekerk forward from round the wicket, beating her inside edge. The left-arm spinner is giving her nothing. She finds one out to deep point, Brunt again preventing a second from being taken with her effort on the rope. Two singles, that’s their lot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9349bda4b03782eed3e3e8758c15018f32fa8d1d/0_40_1768_1061/master/1768.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=538dde8077841aad1ed722a5317676dd","title":"us open 2018 second round live","story":"An excellent iron shot from Rose finds the green but he can’t quite nail his birdie putt.

Finally it’s Tiger, who confidently drills a right-to-left slider in for back-to-back birdies. That’s a 72. He’s +10. It probably won’t be enough to survive the cut, with the conditions improving this afternoon, and Fleetwood having demonstrated that a low score is out there. But you never know.Tiger gives himself half a chance, finding the centre of the 9th green with his second. DJ and JT are both on in regulation as well all three will have a look at birdie from 30 feet or so.Birdie for Tiger at 8. Too little, too late? He’s +11 now, and will almost certainly need a birdie up the last ... and even then, that might not be enough to survive the cut. He’s sent his tee shot at 9 straight down the middle. He’ll be dreaming of holing out from the fairway he needs that miracle if he’s to fall inside the current projected cut, which sends everyone at +10 and above home. But nothing’s certain with the afternoon rounds still stretching out ahead of us.Henrik Stenson moves himself into serious contention with an eagle on the par-five 16th. Two big hits and a straight putt up the green from 12 feet. No biggie. He’s +1 all of a sudden, and for a second day in a row, has set about salvaging his round after a godawful start. Magnificent. That astonishing par save on 14 looks really important now. And how about this on 9? Tommy Fleetwood rattles in a 25-footer for a third birdie in five holes! He’s back in 32, and signs for a 66 that, on this toughest of courses, is nothing much short of sensational! He came close last year at Erin Hills could the European number one go three places better this year? Meanwhile Scott Piercy bogeys his opening hole, the 10th, and suddenly the leader board has a fresh new look!What a putt by Dustin Johnson! His tee shot at 7 had nearly toppled down the swale to the right of the green, but his ball held the putting surface. Just. He’s left with a 46-footer. He strokes it hole-ward. It’s pretty straight, with a very small right to left break. For a while it doesn’t look as though he’s given it enough juice. Then it looks good. Then it slows again. And it’s surely going to run out of steam before it drops. But the ball heaves, one last turn, and it’s in! What a crowd-pleasing tease that putt was! DJ smiles broadly, and no wonder! He’s three in the lead now. JT tidies up for his birdie, and rises to +4, but that seems almost immaterial after that astonishing rake!Thomas goes straight at the flag on 7. He manages to outdo Fleetwood by launching his 9-iron to six feet. That’s a wonderful shot. Up on 8, Fleetwood makes a fuss-free par. He’s one more par away from a superb 67. Cabrera Bello signs for a 71 that promised so much more: he’d been out in 32. But he’s nicely placed for the weekend at +4.The sun’s streaming across Shinnecock Hills now. On 6, Dustin raps a fairly straight uphill birdie putt 32 feet towards the hole. Only problem is, he was 32 feet and five inches away. So close to a three-shot lead. Par will suffice compare and contrast to his playing partner Tiger, who drops yet another shot, the result of finding the long grass with his drive and being forced to take his medicine and chip out. The three-time champion is now +12 and won’t be making the weekend unless he does something highly interesting over the closing three holes. Par for Thomas, incidentally: he stays at +5.Tommy Fleetwood isn’t making the same mistake twice. He arrows his tee shot at the supposedly impossible par-three 7th to ten feet, then curls in the birdie putt to move to +2. He’s right in this! You’ll not see anyone play the hole better this week. Meanwhile trouble for Henley down the 9th. He sends his drive into the semi-rough down the left, and can only advance his ball to within 90 yards of the green. He loops his third into the heart of the green, but nowhere near the flag. He can’t make the long saver, and that’s a closing-hole bogey. He signs for a disappointing 73, having gone out in 34 but come back in 39. Still, he’s the clubhouse leader for now at +2.Tommy Fleetwood caresses a lovely approach at 6 to 12 feet. But he doesn’t hit the birdie putt, the ball dying off to the left. He remains at +3. Dustin Johnson pars 5 to stay in pole position at -3. And scrub those worries about Henrik Stenson: from up the bank to the right of 14, he punches out to four feet, even getting a bit of backspin so his ball screeches to a halt near the flag. That is outrageous from where he was. He’ll surely save his par now.Russell Henley three-putts on the par-three 7th. Bogey, and then he lets a very makeable 14-footer slip past the hole for birdie on 8. He remains at +1. Jason Dufner misses a tiddler on 3 to drop to +5 his putting makes Rory McIlroy look like Bobby Locke. And so much for Henrik Stenson’s comeback: he’s sent his second shot at 14 up a fescue-smothered bank, the ball coming off the toe of his iron and flying almost straight right. A bogey will be a result from there.Birdie for Dustin on 4, the reward for sending his second shot to eight feet. He’s two clear of Piercy and Poulter again. Tommy Fleetwood grabs back the shot he dropped at 4 with a 15-foot birdie putt on 5: he’s +3. And is Henrik Stenson about to launch another comeback? He’s just curled in a 20-footer for birdie on 13, to get back to +3.Dufner continues to move backwards at speed. A bogey at 1, his third in a row, and the 2013 PGA champion is in danger of playing himself out of contention. The weather has been drizzly all morning, but is beginning to brighten up a little, if you ignore the wind and the small cloud above the Somnambulist’s head.JT does extremely well to lag up from 60 feet, but he’s still tapping in for bogey. Suddenly he’s back down at +5, seven off the lead. No-nonsense pars for DJ and Tiger. Alex Noren birdies 4 to move back to +3 but his playing partner Tommy Fleetwood bogeys the hole to slip to +4. Of all the morning starters, there are only five players under par for their rounds right now: DJ, Fleetwood, Tony Finau, Gary Woodland and Haotong Li. Only the first three are in any sort of contention (Finau is, like Fleetwood, +4).A basic error by Thomas down 3. Having sent his tee shot into the deep stuff to the right, he tries to snatch too many yards with his second, punching out with a 9-iron and ending up in the first cut on the other side. A wedge might have been smarter. As it is, he’s lost control coming in with his third, and he’s left with a 60-footer to save his par.Russell Henley arrests his slide with birdie at the par-five 5th. He’s back to level par for the tournament.Thomas, Johnson and Woods all fail to reach the 232-yard par-three 2nd with their tee shots. Justin leaves himself an awkward stance by the side of a bunker to the left, Tiger is in sand on the right, and Dustin leaves himself short. Nothing comes easy round Shinnecock. And only Dustin, who missed in the right place, can make the up and down. Thomas slips to +4 while Tiger drops to +11. Elsewhere, Jason Dufner’s slide down the leader board continues apace: bogey at 18, and he completes the back nine in 38. He’s +3 for both round and tournament.So having just said Dustin Johnson doesn’t look like making any mistakes, he drops his first stroke of the day. Pulitzer, please! He dumps his second at 1 into the sand, and can’t get up and down. He moves back to -2. Thomas, who pars quietly, is only five off the lead now. Meanwhile Rafa Cabrera Bello’s fine round has fallen apart: he’s followed up that bogey at 2 with a double at 3, the result of finding a bunker off the tee and not getting out with any great style. He’s back to where he started the day, at +3. Does the Spaniard’s travails remind you of anyone? Sergio’s seven over for his round through 12 today, incidentally: he’s +12 and almost certainly going home soon.Tiger took triple bogey on the 1st hole yesterday, and he’s not enjoying it now either. From the centre of the fairway, he’s sent his approach well right, into extremely thick nonsense. He’s got to get over a bunker, and there’s not a lot of green to play with. And sure enough, from a dreadfully tangled lie, he sends his ball flying through the green and down the bank on the other side. It only just avoids the tall grass. He bumps it back up onto the dancefloor, but a good 15 feet past the hole. That’s a double-bogey six. This hole has cost him five strokes in two days. He’s +10. Weekend participation is beginning to look like a pipe dream: the cut is the top 60 plus ties, which right now stands at +7. A long time to go, though, and it’s likely to move out.So there are now only three players under par for the tournament. Only one of them is out on the course right now, and that’s the leader Dustin Johnson. The big man doesn’t look in the mood to make a mistake right now, but well, y’know. I don’t think anybody in golf will be counting chickens yet. Still, of the chasing group, only Rafa Cabrera Bello has made a determined move in the right direction this morning, and even he’s just taken one step backwards. Russell Henley has just posted that triple, while Jason Dufner’s gone and dropped another at 17 to slip to +2. Links expert Tommy Fleetwood is coming up on the rail, mind: a birdie at 2 brings him up to +3.There’s a first blemish on Rafa Cabrera Bello’s card: he drops a stroke at 2 to slip back to +1. And he’s joined on that mark by Russell Henley, who crashes out of the lead after a triple-bogey disaster on 3, the result of sending his drive into deep trouble down the left and failing to extricate himself from the fescue.Thomas wedges close to secure a fine par. He was in trouble after that drive, faced with a steep bunker face, and did well to get so close to the green with his second. He’s scrambled well this morning. He turns in 34 he’s +3. Tiger’s long bunker shot whistles a good 40 feet past the hole. He then leaves his long par putt six feet short he makes it, avoiding the double, but he’s still dropping back to +8. DJ splashes out to five feet, and completes another fine up and down. He reaches the turn in 33. And he’s taking control of this US Open, because ...A huge break for Tiger on 18. His drive is heading off into the tall fescue on the right. But there’s a glaikit spotter standing in the semi-rough, staring into the distance the wrong way, and he’s clattered on the legs by the bounding ball. It stops dead in the shorter stuff. But Tiger doesn’t take advantage, sending his second into sand well short of the green. Thomas is just off the front in two, having found a deep bunker with his tee shot. And finally the leader DJ, from a perfect position in the centre of the fairway, flies a wedge straight over the green and into the sand at the back. That’s an appalling miss. All three of this group are in a spot of bother.Passing JT the other way: Henrik Stenson. I was wondering whether the 2016 Open champion might be a good shout for this tournament, on account of his leading the driving accuracy rankings. Yesterday’s 71 suggested maybe, maybe. But he’s not making much of a case for himself today: bogeys already at 2 and 6, and now another at 7. He slips to +4. Having said all that, he started abysmally yesterday, too, only to revive his bid during the later stages of his round. Sweden will have its fingers crossed.Dustin isn’t plugged. That’s a break. The rain, firming up the bunkers, will have helped. And from the soft, wet sand, he tosses his ball next to the flag, very nearly holing out for birdie. He’ll escape with par. Tiger takes two putts from the front of the green for his par. And Thomas tidies up for a brilliant birdie: he’s +3, and after hanging on in there during the early stages of this round, the recently deposed world number one is slowly moving into contention. He’s only six off DJ’s lead, in a tie for 14th. And he notoriously picks up momentum through tournaments. The field will be taking notice.“Go hard! Go hard!” Dustin’s tee shot at the par-three 17th is sent miles into the air ... and slam-dunks into the bunker guarding front left. He’s shortsided, and possibly plugged. Justin Thomas doesn’t let the disappointment of the previous hole get to him, though, sending his effort to five feet, one of the shots of the day.But DJ knocks in his birdie putt, and he’s once more the sole leader of this tournament. Tiger follows him in to rise to +7. Meanwhile Rafa Cabrera Bello retains his status as the hottest player out on the course right now, creaming an iron from 190 yards to five feet on 18. A third birdie of the day, and he reaches the turn in 32.Tiger and Dustin lay up at 16, then knock their third shots to six feet. Both will have great chance of birdie. but Thomas goes for it, creaming a fairway wood in the hope of reaching in two. His ball looks like heading into a bunker front left, but snags in thick fescue guarding it, instead. That’s an unlucky break, and he’s fuming, stomping around in the hot manner. But good pros know how to compartmentalise their rage, and he simmers down, slashing a wonderfully judged wedge through the thick rough and up onto the green. He’s left with an uphill ten footer for birdie ... and he underhits it by one joule of energy. So close to an amazing up and down. But the rain’s softened the green, and you need to give them just a little extra oomph. Thomas stays at +4.The rain continues to fall. It’s getting heavier. Most refreshing. Tiger Woods, Dustin Johnson and Justin Thomas have all crashed their drives down 16, but play’s slowed up here. A lot of waiting around. Elsewhere, Henrik Stenson has dropped another stroke, this time at 6: he’s +3. Brandt Snedeker bogeys 11 to slip to +3. And back-to-back bogeys for Byeong Hun An at 2 and 3 send him down to +3 as well.The players won’t mind this shower, though. Anything that makes the greens a little more responsive. They’re happily prancing around with their umbrellas up. Two putts for Dustin, his birdie effort shaving the right edge, and he remains in a share of the lead at -2. His co-leader, Russell Henley, has just completed the back nine in 34 strokes. Pars for Tiger and JT at 15 too. The long par-five coming up.A little bit of drizzle falling at Shinnecock Hills. A lovely Open Championship atmosphere. Just a month to go until Carnoustie, folks. Can you wait? Us neither. Anyway, this rain isn’t likely to hang around. On 15, DJ clips a wedge from 140 yards to 15 feet or so. He’ll have a good look at birdie from there. Meanwhile Rafa Cabrera Bello joins the group at +1 with his second birdie of the day, at 16. Nobody’s playing better today than the talented 34-year-old Spaniard whose record in the majors - one top-five finish at last years’s Open apart - is surprisingly average.“Dammit, Tiger! Fuck!” At which point Woods tries to bury the hosel of his wedge into the turf. Bam! Bat! He’s really not happy with that third shot, viewing families of America. Thing is, the ball bites pin high, 20 feet from the cup. High standards, this dude, but then he has won 14 majors. Two putts, and that’s a bogey, all the fault of the wild drive. Johnson and Thomas get up and down for their pars. Meanwhile Dufner continues to go the wrong way: another problem from over the back of the green, this time at 13, leading to back-to-back bogeys. Just a little bit of separation at the top of the leader board now.Trouble for everyone down the long par-four 14th. Tiger’s in the deep stuff down the right, and can only hack back out onto the fairway. Dustin’s in the first cut on the other side, and was expecting his ball to come out hot, but he didn’t get a flyer and his second stops well short of the green. Thomas was in the middle of the fairway, but dumped his approach into the bunker front right. He’s still in the best nick of the three, though.Jason Dufner drops back to level par for the championship. His tee shot at 12 found the rough to the right, his second flew through the green, and you know how that usually pans out on this course by now. Young Sam Burns has completed the back nine in 36 strokes, improving on his slow start with birdie at 17: he’s back to +2. And Tommy Fleetwood is in credit today: birdie at 10, bogey at 11, and another birdie at 13 sees him nudge up the leader board to +4. Brought up on the links of Royal Birkdale, you’d think this set-up would favour a player with the European number one’s experience he’s nicely placed, six off the lead.Big Dustin is one cool customer. Having hit a terrible wedge in, leaving himself quite the poser, he clips a crisp wedge over the sand to three feet. That’s such a lovely shot in the circumstances. He simply refused to let the initial mistake fluster him. He salvages his par. Meanwhile a two-putt par for Tiger that’s two putts shaved off yesterday’s total on this hole. And finally a brilliant birdie for Thomas, who didn’t play a particularly good bunker shot, but curled in a confident right-to-left breaker from ten feet. He moves back to +4.A big mistake by DJ, whose wedge into 13 only just reaches the green, and topples back off, rolling behind the bunker Thomas is in. That’s an awful miss, and the co-leader’s going to have some work getting up and down for his par. Tiger leaves himself a 15-foot uphill putt for birdie that one wild drive aside, he’s looked very solid today. To be fair, he looked very solid yesterday, if you factor out three rushes of blood that led to two double bogeys and a triple. But that’s golf for you.Some downtime on the 13th tee as the players wait for the green to be cleared. It’s a short par four, and Justin Thomas is going for it. He sends his drive into the bunker guarding the front right of the green that’s the place to miss. Tiger and Dustin decide to take irons instead. Beforehand, up on the dancefloor, Pat Perez stroked in a 30-footer for a birdie that takes him to +2.Tiger wedges delicately to a couple of feet. That’s a wonderful par save. Then Thomas bumps his third up to three feet he’ll escape with a par after a wild tee shot, too. Finally Dustin, who has a fairly straight 30-foot birdie putt. He tugs it a bit, but it’s perfectly judged for speed, so that’s three pars out of three on 12 for this group. Tiger is +7, Thomas +5, Johnson -2.Dustin finds his third green in regulation out of three. The benefit of being on the fairway. By comparison, Thomas flies his second through the back, facing an up and down from thick greenside rough, while Tiger can only hack his way out of the thick fescue and into the first cut on the other side of the fairway. He’s still got 70 yards to the green. Birdie meanwhile for Jason Dufner at 10 he immediately joins Scott Piercy and Ian Poulter, both out later this afternoon, at -1.Oh Sergio. The 2017 Masters champion (it’s nice to type that) wasn’t in the worst position after his opening round of 75, but he’s playing himself out of contention this morning. A bogey at 11 followed a double at 12, his putter letting him down badly. He crashes to +8. Meanwhile a bogey for Henrik Stenson at 2, and the handily placed Swede slips to +2.All change at the top! Russell Henley can’t get up and down from the side of 14, and drops back to -2. Meanwhile joining him in the lead is Big Dustin, who clipped his tee shot at 11 to five feet and then knocked in the birdie putt. He looks calm and controlled this week, coming off the back of victory at last week’s St Jude Classic, a win that returned him to world number one. He’s the only man in his group to crash his drive down the middle of 12, as well: Thomas wangs his right, while Tiger is in fescue on the other side.Oh Justin. Disoriented after playing 10 so badly, Thomas pulls his tee shot at the par-three 11th down the swale to the left of the green. Jordan Spieth took a couple of attempts to chip up the bank from there yesterday, so Thomas elects to play a Scottish-style bump along the ground. The ball still slips 20 feet past the hole ... but oh Justin! He rattles in the putt coming back, and that’s a sensational up and down from a very difficult position. He stays at +5. I have no idea why more players aren’t employing links tactics when they get in trouble round here, the old-school course being what it is, but players insist on getting the lob wedges out regardless, like it’s a regular week on Tour or something. Anyway, Thomas appears to have learned his lesson. That was brilliant course management. He was staring double bogey in the face there.A birdie earlier for Rafa Cabrera Bello, at 10 he moves to +2. An eventful start for Alex Noren, who doubled 10 but birdied the par-three 11th he’s +3. Brian Gay made 73 yesterday, briefly sharing the lead, but bogeys at 10, 12 and 15 see the veteran journeyman drop to +6. The 21-year-old Sam Burns, a hot prospect from Louisiana, shot a fine 71 yesterday but he’s bogeyed 12 and 15 today he’s +3. And the equally promising Xander Schauffele is heading the wrong way, too: he’s dropped shots at 2 and 3, and slips to +4.Thomas is made to pay for that mistake off the tee. His chip up from the back is the best part of 40 feet short, and his par putt isn’t all that either. He’s got a seven-footer for bogey. He does very well to roll it in, and limit the damage. He’s +5. Par for Dustin, who remains at -1. Tiger nearly misses his short birdie putt, the ball skirting all the way round the lip before dropping, but it’s in, and he’s +7. He looks happy and relaxed today here’s to his being one of many to embark on a charge up the leader board.That’s a chance for the overnight co-leader Dustin Johnson to close the gap at the top. Because Russell Henley was out very early, and he’s gone off like a train, arrowing approaches to the pin and 10 and 12 to tear off on his own. Here’s how that’s changed the toppermost of the leader board.Good morning, Southampton! Will today play even tougher than yesterday? With the wind switching around all day, it’s possible. Then again, the hole placements are a little bit more accessible. So it’s swings and roundabouts. Either way, accuracy from the tee is still essential ... as immediately proved by Justin Thomas. The reigning PGA champion let his opening tee shot, an iron from 10, drift off to the left. From the semi-rough, he’s taken a flyer straight through the green and down the back. That’ll be a test coming back up. By comparison, his playing partners Dustin Johnson and Tiger Woods found the fairway, and have set up birdie chances with their approaches. Tiger’s is particularly special, to three or four feet.Welcome to the second round of the 2018 US Open at Shinnecock Hills, where the world’s greatest players are being put through quite the test. The three-time champion Tiger Woods shot 78 yesterday, as did 2015 winner Jordan Spieth the 2011 champ Rory McIlroy couldn’t break 80 the 2014 champ Martin Kaymer, who carded 65 on his opening round at Pinehurst, signed for an 83.But, y’know, winning a US Open shouldn’t be easy. And you shouldn’t necessarily be under par. Only four players posted a red number yesterday the USGA will argue that this is exactly how it should be. That 7th hole still looks like a poser too far, mind. But hey ho. Here’s the very top of the leader board, and remember, for every Tiger, Jordan and Rory, there’s a Dustin Johnson, Justin Rose, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, Rickie Fowler, Justin Thomas and Louis Oosthuizen placed very handily.The tee times, starting at hole 1 ...... and starting at hole 10..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd99ff4aade0be506d1a04dd18961b9d596bde0f/391_32_2063_1238/master/2063.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64f1ae8a93a5a50da95a76eb287322db","title":"derry girls actor nicola coughlan apology overweight girl review","story":"British Theatre Guide apologises to Nicola Coughlan after Miss Jean Brodie reviewThe British Theatre Guide has apologised to the Derry Girls actor Nicola Coughlan after one of its reviewers described her as an “overweight little girl”. The offending description, which has since been removed, appeared in Philip Fisher’s review of The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie at the Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden, London. He wrote that Coughlan as Joyce Emily was “the kind of overweight little girl who will always become the butt of her fellows’ immature humour”. Responding on Twitter, the actor complained that was the second time Fisher had been to see a show she was in and “as part of reviewing the show he has also reviewed my body”. Addressing Fisher, the BTG’s London editor, she said: “I know you are a theatre reviewer and your body has no relevance to your job but maybe you’d like me to cruelly review it for you and post it online.”In tweets to the British Theatre Guide (BTG), she said Fisher was not welcome to review any more shows in which she appears. After her initial post, she won backing from many people on Twitter including fellow actors.Susan Wokoma, who starred in Crazyhead and Chewing Gum, wrote: “This has happened to me before, it’s really unnerving. Sharing solidarity – we must call reviewers out on this!” Responding a few hours later, the BTG said: “Nicola, we apologise unreservedly for the offence caused by the wording of this review. The offending words have been removed. While the reviewer may not have intended to offend, he accepts that it is not acceptable to use such descriptions in a review and not BTG policy.”Some on Twitter complained that the apology did not go far enough as it only apologised for “offence caused”.Coughlan plays Clare in Channel 4’s hit comedy Derry Girls, which is set in Northern Ireland in the 1990s at the tail end of the Troubles.

That turned out not to be the case: it was the 1975 film (which Kesey opposed and refused to watch) that immortalised the story of renegade criminal Randle P McMurphy, his nemesis Nurse Ratched and the state-sanctioned tyrannies of the American psychiatric system in the 1960s.Javaad Alipoor, the director of this latest revival, attempts to steal the story out of the shadows of that film by staging Wasserman’s play with unapologetic purism. The narrator, Chief Bromden, is reinstated as a prominent character, magnetically played by the part-Anishinaabe actor Jeremy Proulx, whose lumbering presence is set against the poetic vulnerability in his monologues. McMurphy’s predatory view of women – which the film allows us to forget and forgive – is also laid bare: here, he is not just anti-authority but volubly anti-women, excusing himself for raping a 15-year-old girl (she lied about her age, he claims). This gains resonance in the wake of #MeToo but the production feels oddly tame: its anarchic humour is tepid and the glowering, antiestablishment rage of Kesey’s novel is lost. Part of the problem may be the production’s faithfulness to the original adaptation, which came at an incendiary moment in psychiatry in the light of works by RD Laing and Michel Foucault, who critiqued its oppressive systems of control. This feels dated in the context of modern debates in mental health. Lucy Osborne’s design is the show’s biggest success: the set has an eerily clinical spareness, just tables, chairs and a cleverly constructed light-box on one side of the stage that gives the nurses an ominous silhouette, while Lewis Gibson’s jittery soundscape infuses the production with intensity.Proulx gives the standout performance, while Jack Tarlton is convincing as the sexually inadequate husband Harding, and so is Arthur Hughes as the stuttering virgin Billy. Jenny Livsey stepped in to play Ratched at the last minute after Lucy Black sustained an injury and withdrew and she warms to her part as the “juggernaut of matriarchy”. Joel Gillman plays McMurphy with a puckish energy reminiscent – perhaps too reminiscent – of Jack Nicholson: it is there in the pitch and tone of his delivery and even the hat and hairline. The result is that Gillman’s McMurphy pales by association. Despite some strong performances, the ensemble lacks the chemistry to create enough of an emotional disturbance as Ratched rounds on the ward, quashing rebellion by ultimately quashing McMurphy. There is better synergy between the actors in the second part: a Darwinian sense of the jungle emerges as the weak are swallowed up by the system.

For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.”While some internet users called for a “boycott of Einstein” and said his observations proved “all humans, even Einstein, have a stupid, shallow side,” most said the China Einstein witnessed is nothing like it is today. “Einstein went to China at the wrong time,” said one Weibo user, describing the early years of the Chinese republic, established in 1912, which came after centuries of imperial rule. “Hunger, war, and poverty all pressed on the Chinese. How could Chinese people at the time gain Einstein’s respect?” Many were in strong support of the scientist: “This is called insulting China? That’s ridiculous. Did the Chinese in that era look dirty? When I see the photos from then, they look dirty, Einstein depicted the true state of that era.”Others compared the scientists’s observations to that of Lu Xun, considered the father of modern Chinese literature, who was best known for his scathing satire of Chinese society in the early 20th century. “We praise Lu Xun because he pointed out our disadvantages. Why should we blame Einstein for this?”Historical narratives promoted by the Chinese government often paint the days before China’s communist party took power in 1949 as chaotic. The state-run Global Times published an editorial on Friday praising the level-headed response of Chinese internet users. The author, who goes by the pen name Gengzhige, wrote: “I’m curious what Einstein would write now if he saw the open attitudes most Chinese show today toward his private diary.” The editorial elicited over 2,000 comments. One of the most liked responses said: “Dignity is earned by oneself, not given by others.”But there were some dissenting voices amongst the comments: “This is just racism. We can see that Einstein is strong in physics but he doesn’t understand humans at all.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92fa4b2ea7192ed9feec59824938ca65a014d0c8/0_167_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=58f1b0d61088b7820b891cb5fc67d731","title":"delhi blanketed by smog so toxic it cant be measured","story":"Dust storms come months before the start of city’s traditional ‘pollution season’Smog more toxic than can be measured by monitoring devices has blanketed the Indian capital this week, months before the start of Delhi’s traditional “pollution season”.A thick haze was visible across the city from Tuesday and some government pollution monitors have recorded concentrations of 999 – the highest they can measure – as dust storms kicked up in nearby Rajasthan state blanketed the region.Though the billowing clouds of dust and sand were blamed for the immediate spike in pollution levels, the sight of dense smog engulfing Delhi months before winter has underscored a growing awareness that harmful air is a year-round problem for the city.Air quality in Delhi usually begins to plummet in October when slower winds and cooler temperatures trap pollutants closer to the ground.But data published by the government’s Central Pollution Control Board shows that air quality has been classed “very unhealthy” – with index scores as high as 270 – every April and May for the past three years, or since authorities began collecting and publishing the statistics.Just a single day in April or May of the past three years had air classified as “good” – 12 April this year, when levels fell to 99. “It clearly shows that this is also a summertime problem,” said Aishwarya Sudhir, an independent researcher who studies air quality in India.Authorities have ordered a halt to all construction in the capital and its satellite cities until the weekend to reduce pollution levels, and doctors have advised people to stay indoors as much as possible. Meteorologists said the presence of a layer of dust across the city is also trapping heat, sending temperatures soaring in excess of 40C.Concern about north India’s air quality crisis is usually most acute after the Hindu festival of Diwali in autumn, when hundreds of thousands of Indians release firecrackers that combine with existing pollutants to form a poisonous haze over the region that persists for months until temperatures cool. Public health experts said pollution levels on some days in November last year were the equivalent of smoking 50 cigarettes per day.India, home to 14 of the world’s top 20 most polluted cities, has the highest rate of respiratory diseases of any country. A leading lung specialist, Arvind Kumar, says the cancer patients he sees Delhi are younger, more often female and more likely to be non smokers than those outside the city.Children are the most vulnerable: a 2015 study concluded about half Delhi’s 4.4m schoolchildren had stunted lung development and would never completely recover.But pressure on local and central governments to act usually clears along with the air in February when warmer temperatures help to thin the smog.Sudhir said this week’s spike in pollution was a wake-up call that Delhi’s air is rarely safe. “Polluting activities keep going on in the city during summer, including construction, allowing road dust to linger, the operation of coal-fired power plants and other things,” she said.Under an action plan in place since January 2017, pollution levels of the kind recorded this week should have resulted in trucks being denied entry into the city, the closure of brick kilns and other polluting industries, and a ban on using diesel generators.Yet the government seems only to implement some of these measures, and only in response to public outcry, she said.“We tend to act only when it’s an emergency,” she said. “There were forecasts that dust storms would sweep the entire region. They should have acted on these weeks ago, not when it became this severe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d5067015df2e26abb579b68e9fd5ec021a62613a/0_0_4724_2836/master/4724.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=495a9477444a8beceead098b5695a4b7","title":"matteo salvini from far right fringe player to strongman leader","story":"Migrant standoff has bolstered interior minister’s profile, leaving him unofficially playing PM’s roleMatteo Salvini is unofficially assuming the role of prime minister of Italy after a week in which a standoff over stranded migrants and a row with France has bolstered the interior minister’s profile and created the appearance he is setting the country’s agenda.The transformation of Salvini from far-right fringe candidate to popular strongman leader could have vast implications for the future of Italy, its role in Europe and the fragile alliance that now governs the country.His popularity has increased by about 10 percentage points since the 4 March election, which resulted in a hung parliament with his party, the League, placed second in terms of seats. It has also won him admiration from the biggest cheerleader in support of far-right populist movements in Europe. “He stepped up and took some pretty dramatic action. I don’t think it could have turned out better for him,” said Steve Bannon, the former adviser to US president Donald Trump who has spent time in Italy and been a vociferous supporter of the far-right surge.Analysts say Salvini’s rise reflects the fact that he is a skilled politician and is competing for attention against Giuseppe Conte, the law professor who was plucked out of obscurity and named prime minister after Salvini and Di Maio agreed neither of them would assume the role, but who is seen as weak.Salvini, a former talk radio host, has made a career out of demonising migrants. He made good on his campaign promise to crack down on irregular migration this week when, in his first major decision as interior minister, he blocked an NGO ship, the Aquarius, with more than 600 migrants on board from docking in Sicily.While the decision created a humanitarian crisis – Spain ultimately agreed to accept the migrants in Valencia – Salvini celebrated it as a big victory. When Italy’s refusal to accept the migrants elicited a sharp rebuke from Emmanuel Macron, the French president, it was seen among Italians as a deeply hypocritical response, given France’s reluctance to accept migrants and refugees.Stopping the Aquarius migrant vessel, Orsina said, had cost Salvini nothing, and the fight with Macron, even for those Italians who do not support the League, has garnered him even more support given the Italian view that the rest of the EU, and especially France, have left the country to deal with the migrant crisis on its own.“Many Italians will say they are not with Salvini but that against the French they are with him, because they will say that what Macron said is false, hypocritical, unbearable,” Orsina said. It was also possible that Salvini – like Matteo Renzi before him – could ride a wave of popularity that collapses, much like the former centre-left prime minister did, he said. Bannon, speaking to the , said he believed that Salvini had done a “great job” by taking on the issue of migration in the first weeks of the new government.“Particularly since it is the summer and the crisis is only going to continue. And he showed the complete hypocrisy of Macron, and I think it is important for the people of Italy to see that he is willing to stand up,” Bannon said. “It is a central part of why Macron is going to crash and burn, he’s all big talk.”For migrants who were rescued by the Aquarius, the decision led to even more hardship. The boat is not expected to arrive in Valencia until Saturday or Sunday, and there are multiple accounts that those onboard, who include children, are suffering intense seasickness. Their journey to Spain has also been interrupted by poor weather, and legal experts have accused Italy of breaking international humanitarian rules.Flavio Di Giacomo, the spokesman for the UN migration agency, the IOM, said it was not the first time that a boat had been blocked from entering Italy. “What has changed is that this time the public opinion is backing this kind of action, which in part is because the anti-NGO narrative has won in the public opinion,” said Di Giacomo. Salvini, and other Italian politicians, have argued that NGOs who rescue migrants represent a “pull factor”, encouraging African economic migrants to make the journey across the Mediterranean. But many migration experts have argued that poor conditions are forcing migrants to flee, and that the NGOs are saving lives.Within a government that has a share of eclectic personalities, including an undersecretary who believes the moon landing was a hoax, Salvini has stood out in part by setting the agenda in a way that focuses on issues he has control over.“He is making migration the most important issue of the country, and then it follows that the minister who handles migration is the most important leader,” said Sergio Fabbrini at Luiss University. “The Five Star Movement is without an agenda, without a strategy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1faccf15ca7ef2d169cb8575ac8eba7763b9f233/126_46_684_410/master/684.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff58f9a5629eb41d51a966a436ef9f69","title":"uk visa of russian oligarch who met arron banks under review","story":"Siman Povarenkin one of 700 whose tier one visas are being reviewed after spy poisoningThe oligarch who met Arron Banks to discuss a lucrative gold deal is one of 700 wealthy Russians whose “tier one” visas are being reviewed after the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal. Siman Povarenkin is entitled to residency in the UK, and eventual citizenship, through his wife Irina’s visa. She moved to Britain in 2013 with their two children after investing at least £2m. Povarenkin travels regularly from Moscow to visit his family. In November 2015 Russia’s ambassador to the UK, Alexander Yakovenko, introduced Povarenkin to Banks, the Brexit campaigner and Leave.EU donor. Banks had insisted his contacts with Yakovenko amounted to one “boozy six-hour lunch”. In fact, Banks had three meetings with the ambassador, two in the run up to the EU referendum.Yakovenko suggested Banks might be interested in investing in Povarenkin’s mining business. The deal could potentially have netted him billions of dollars, according to documents.On 17 July 2016 Banks tweeted: “I am buying gold at the moment \u0026amp big mining stocks.” Povarenkin is a successful entrepreneur with top-level Kremlin contacts. According to people familiar with his business affairs, the state entity involved in the potential deal was Sberbank, Russia’s biggest bank.Sberbank’s CEO is Herman Gref, an influential former economics minister. In 2013 Gref had dinner with Donald Trump during the Miss Universe beauty pageant in Moscow, which Sberbank co-sponsored. Trump “had a good attitude towards Russia”, Gref said afterwards. In 2014 the US imposed sanctions on Sberbank over Russia’s annexation of Crimea.The documents suggest further meetings and discussions took place between Povarenkin and Banks, after the initial introduction, including a trip by Banks to Moscow in February 2016, the Observer reported. Banks told CNN reports of the trip were not true. Povarenkin became rich while still in his 20s, contemporaries say. One described him as a diminutive figure with long, dark curly hair. He speaks English well and with a strong Russian accent, they said.“He was a young and wealthy guy. It wasn’t very clear what the source of his wealth was. There were literally hundreds of such people in Russia during this period,” said one Moscow businessman who met him socially.Povarenkin was born in the Siberian city of Omsk. He later worked for the Moscow private equity company Industrial Investors Group. Its boss, Sergei Generalov, was a deputy in the state parliament and energy minister under Boris Yeltsin. Generalov is in turn close to Sergei Kiriyenko, Vladimir Putin’s chief of staff. Povarenkin’s home is a six-bedroom mansion in Gribovo, a village set amid pine forests seven miles (12km) west of central Moscow. The area is favoured by Russia’s political and business elite. One of his neighbours is Vladislav Surkov, a personal adviser to Putin.One person familiar with the Moscow business world said of Povarenkin: “He’s a typical ‘minigarch’ guy who managed to cobble together a bunch of assets, deploying the typical Russian means of doing it.” The person said Povarenkin had good krysha, from the Russian word for roof, meaning a powerful patron deep inside Russia’s ruling structures. “Who his krysha really is I don’t know,” the person said.Between 2005 and 2008 Povarenkin set up GeoProMining, buying gold mining enterprises in Armenia, Russia and Georgia. The purchase would have involved substantial borrowing. Like other businessmen, including Banks, Povarenkin makes extensive use of offshore vehicles.In 2013 Irina Povarenkin and the couple’s two children moved to London, according to legal documents. She was able to do so after buying a tier one investors’ visa, available to well-off foreigners who invest at least £2m in government bonds. Povarenkin is classed as his wife’s dependent.The Home Office is currently reviewing the status of about 700 Russians, including the Chelsea FC owner, Roman Abramovich, who made use of the scheme before rules were tightened in 2015. The review follows the poisoning in March of Sergei Skripal, a former Russian military intelligence officer, and his daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury.In 2015 the Povarenkins purchased an £11.3m flat in Ebury Square in Belgravia, west London, documents show. Typically the gold tycoon spends about 70 days a year in the UK, flying in regularly from Moscow to see his family. Summers are spent at a luxury chateau in Normandy that was owned by the late Yves Saint Laurent.In February 2017 the oligarch flew to London to celebrate his wife and son’s birthdays. At Heathrow airport he was served with a writ from a disgruntled former business partner, Ruslan Bestolov. Bestolov alleges that Povarenkin owes him $7.5m (£5.6m), arising from two joint mine projects in the Russian republic of Yakutia. Povarenkin denies this.In 2017 the case went to the high court, when Bestolov successfully argued that the dispute should be heard in London and not Moscow. A judge ruled that Povarenkin had a “substantial connection” to the UK, in contrast to other Russian oligarchs such as Oleg Deripaska whose visits are more fleeting.It is unclear why Yakovenko introduced Povarenkin as a potential business partner for Banks, who gave £12m to the Brexit campaign, becoming the biggest political donor in UK history.The ambassador and the oligarch appear to have a good working relationship. In 2011 the pair visited the London Stock Exchange, together with a delegation from Yakutia.A Moscow financial source described Povarenkin’s international assets as “complicated”. Asked why he might have been interested in investment from Banks, they said: “Personal, state and business interests can all be combined in Russia.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Six premises targeted in Criminal Assets Bureau-lead operation in Bray as cash, phones and computers seizedLatin students faced a tough compositionChild\u0026rsquos mother tells court it is \u0026lsquovery hard to explain\u0026rsquo the heartache caused by incidentsSea lions give birth when food is plentiful, giving them a greater chance of survivalLess than 1 per cent of housing in the North is shared between faiths, conference hearsTipperary TD has pleaded not guilty to four charges of filing incorrect tax returnsWild greylag goose found dead in Co Armagh tested positive for H5N6 avian influenzaParty to remove own amendment on Bill as health minister rows back on cancer linkMan would rather be happy at home than safe in a nursing homePrince Charles and Camilla meet with Liberator\u0026rsquos relatives and hear how he championed Catholic EmancipationMembers of syndicate from Stakelum\u0026rsquos Hardware in Thurles each receive \u0026euro531,250Dubliner (35) found guilty of being getaway driver rather then shooter in 2015 killingDaniel Doyle, who was serving a sentence for dealing, was found unresponsive in his cellFionn\u0026aacuten Sheahan\u0026rsquos conflict of evidence with Ann Harris is fourth among journalists to come before tribunalFacebook pages were created to gather users\u0026rsquo personal details for use by more strident sitesBenjamin Heffernan (50) has limited mobility since incident in Co Cork in January 2015Mary McDonnell giving evidence in trial of Thomas Fox and siblings Regina and Jonathan KeoghDoctors conclude breach of contract case against Health Service ExecutiveThe Prince of Wales landed at the home of Daniel O\u0026rsquoConnell by helicopter"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3532054.1529075848!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"17m lottery jackpot winners planning to shop locally","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMembers of a syndicate from Stakelum’s Hardware Store in Thurles, Co Tipperary  collected a €17million EuroMillions cheque at National Lottery headquarters on Friday. Photograph: Nick Bradshaw.Thurles is getting a reputation as a lucky town and Eason in Thurles, a reputation as Ireland’s luckiest shop. The odds on selling a multimillion euro lottery ticket once are slim, the odds on doing it twice in eight months are astronomical. However, shop owner Tom O’Toole followed up selling a ticket that won a €7.5million jackpot last year by selling a €17million EuroMillions winner last week. “We must be the luckiest shop in Europe, ” said Mr O’Toole. The ticket was bought by a syndicate of 32 people who work in Stakelum’s Hardware Store in the Co Tipperary town. The celebrations were, however, deferred due to the death of a syndicate member’s father just before the winning draw. On Friday the group arrived at National Lottery headquarters by bus to collect their prize, which works out at €531,250 per person. The syndicate led by Gerard Sammon, who has been organising the lottery ticket for 20 of the 22 years he has worked at Stakelum’s, was cheered off the bus by lottery staff. The group had never won anything of serious value before, but there are now two couples who are officially millionaires, with the four of them working in the store. Mr Sammon, like most big lottery winners, could hardly believe his luck after seeing the result of the draw and kept the winning ticket by his bed all night. “It’s surreal because you don’t know what to feel. I didn’t get much sleep,” he said. He drove straight to Dublin the morning after the draw and deposited the ticket before spreading the good news to the syndicate. Mr Sammon said he had been saving up to go on a cruise out of Florida featuring musicians Buddy Miller, Emmylou Harris and Josh Ritter. He won’t need to save anymore. Another member, David Foy (29), said he now finds himself with more money that he ever dreamed of. “It’s becoming real,” he said, standing with a glass of champagne in his hand. Will he buy a new car? “I might buy some tyres for the van,” he said. Mr Foy said he intends to keep on working rather than resting on his winnings. “I’m set for life, but we’ll keep the feet on the ground for a little while.” Marie Loughnane, who has worked in Stakelum’s for 29 years, also has no intention of packing the job in. “I have five children from 20 up to 32. They will help me spend it.” There are 75 employees in Stakelum’s and judging by the lengths of service among the syndicate members, and their willingness to continue working after this win, it appears to be a popular employer. “I’m with them 23 years,” said Joe Connolly (40). “They are a lovely family and a good company to work for. There’s a great culture and spirit there. Everyone gets on.“The win is great for the town of Thurles because the money will filter down. We will shop locally.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3530960.1528998711!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"buoyant sinn f%C3%A9in edges further into political mainstream","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Sinn Féin deputy Dáil leader Pearse Doherty Louise O’Reilly leader in Northern Ireland Michelle O’Neill and president Mary Lou McDonald urging a Yes vote in the abortion referendum.

Photograph: Clodagh KilcoyneReutersSinn Féin faces into its first ardfheis with Mary Lou McDonald as leader in bullish form.The transition from Gerry Adams to McDonald has gone well, and she was one of the stars of the campaign to repeal the Eighth Amendment.Her statements that Sinn Féin wants power after the next election – and is not fussy about who it does business with, as long as the terms are right – has made the party a player in debates about coalition before and after the next election.“The dander is up a bit,” says one figure. Internally, at all levels, the main topic for conversation is about government – although opinion is ided on how serious some of these discussions actually are.Suggestions that McDonald is merely engaged in a tactical manoeuvre to keep Sinn Féin relevant while maintaining an ambition to be the lead Opposition party – and, in time, the lead government party – are dismissed.There are two “parallel projects” in play, says one party source. One is to make Sinn Féin the largest Dáil party, and the other is to ensure that elements of its agenda are implemented.Patience to wait for the first goal to be achieved in order to realise the second has run out: “I get the sense that the leadership really want to do business, if the conditions are right,” the source added.“We need to be seen as a party of government and not just of opposition. It needs a gear change. It has happened in the North but it hasn’t happened here,” The  was told.This means, according to party insiders, thinking ahead about how to interact with the civil service and with other southern parties who are well versed in the politics of coalition.A motion to be put before the ardfheis in the Waterfront Hall, Belfast, this weekend said Sinn Féin’s only objective after the next election should be the formation of left wing government.That it was amended by the ard chomhairle, the party’s executive council, to relegate the importance of left-wing government to an attempted, rather than binding, objective says much about the mood of McDonald and those near her.Yet, bit by bit, Sinn Féin is chipping away at the reasons given by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael – both to themselves and to others – for keeping Sinn Féin out of government.McDonald’s leadership is a step away from the past her warm words to business are designed to reassure it that Sinn Féin is sound on economics and Brexit has almost made Ode to Joy as popular a tune as Óró Sé do Bheatha ’Bhaile.For decades, particularly under the leadership of her predecessor, Gerry Adams, the party was often described as a cult where no leadership positions were contested.This weekend, however, there are signals that this is changing. Eoin Ó Broin, the housing spokesman, is standing against Dawn Doyle for the position of general secretary.Ó Broin is from the left of the party and is Dublin-based. His bid is an attempt to win a place on the officer board, where key decisions are made. It is an open expression of ambition, one not often seen.In the eyes of people in Sinn Féin, the reasons for excluding Sinn Féin from government are ever narrowing, and the hard lines taken by Micheál Martin and Leo Varadkar are not taken seriously.“I’ve been around a long time,” says Kerry TD and a former senior figure in the Provisional IRA, Martin Ferris: “I’d heard them say they wouldn’t go in with Proinsias de Rossa and others, and a few weeks later they were in government.”Ferris, who, like Adams, will retire at the next election, says the current feeling towards his party is as good as anything that he has seen since the aftermath of the Good Friday Agreement.However, he is cautious about opinion polls. A jump to 17 or 18 per cent of all votes cast, from just shy of 14 per cent at the last election, will not lead to a substantially increased haul of seats.In 2016, Sinn Féin won 23 Dáil seats. Today, most in the party expect some gains, but it is unlikely to breach the 30-seat mark.Despite its long-term ambitions, the trajectory at the next election points to the consolidation of Sinn Féin’s position as the new “half” party in Irish politics, replacing Labour in a recast 2½ party system.But the enthusiasm for coalition is not shared everywhere in Sinn Féin. A large minority have significant reservations, concerned that they will share the fate of the Progressive Democrats, Labour and others after they made the leap.“But we are not the Labour Party. We’ve served in the North with the DUP,” said a source, insisting that Sinn Féin can break the mould of Irish politics, and not be broken by it.For now, Sinn Féin must identify its key ambitions if it does get into office, and must realise, too, that a balance has to be struck between getting what it wants and accepting what it is uncomfortable with.In Belfast this weekend, it is identifying three priorities: Irish unity, health and housing. “Front and centre of everything the party does is the unity agenda,” said a source. “That informs everything, let’s be clear.”In office, that could, for example, mean legislating to help bring about an all-island public health service, or settling on a common understanding with a coalition partner on the approach to be taken about a unity referendum.Starting points could be Northern Irish representation in the Oireachtas – most likely the Seanad, to begin with – and extending the vote in presidential elections to citizens in Northern Ireland.McDonald must also decide if Sinn Féin should stand against Michael D Higgins, who is expected to confirm next month that he wants a second term as president.The view in Áras an Uachtaráin is that Sinn Féin will not stand against Higgins, and there is no great appetite to do so, according to party insiders. Publicly, however, it has said it would run if there were to be a contest – but not that it would force an election in the absence of other candidates.McDonald has said she believes there should be an election. But TDs say nobody within the party is expressing a desire to stand. Higgins shares a lot of Sinn Féin’s left-wing politics, and older members speak fondly of his record, including repealing section 31 of the broadcasting ban as minister for arts in 1994.“If Michael D Higgins wants to run again, I don’t think we will run anyone against him,” said one TD. “He has very good international politics and a good social conscience.”However, there has been little talk about it. The general election remains the priority. TDs who canvassed heavily during the abortion referendum say local organisations will benefit from the campaign practice.“We basically ran the logistics of the campaign, not that I’d say that,” said one TD of the pro-repeal efforts in their constituency.The fallout from the referendum will be felt in Belfast. An Ard Comhairle motion will, when passed, allow it to determine the party position on the abortion legislation to come before the Dáil and Seanad. In effect it will free TDs and Senators to vote for unrestricted abortion up to 12 weeks.Another motion – the fourth in recent years – calls for a free vote, but this will almost certainly be defeated. McDonald will have to decide how to discipline anti-abortion TDs such as Peadar Tóibín and Carol Nolan if they defy the whip when the legislation comes before the Dáil.Ordinarily, those who rebel are stripped of their party membership for a number of months, as happened Toibín in the past, but there are some who believe that an even tougher line is a possibility.“You can stretch the elastic so much, but it could break,” said one party figure, who said there is a chance – albeit a slim one – that Toibín could find himself expelled from the party for good.“That’s a possibility. At some stage, someone might just say: ‘Ah here, f**k off.’ ”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3530988.1528998171!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit call ireland s bluff on border rees mogg tells may","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tJacob Rees-Mogg: Britain should not do anything that risks security or damages the Irish economy.

And what would the Irish do if the EU insisted? I think that is a really interesting question. I think we should call that particular bluff.”Britain and the EU have agreed that there should be no return to a hard Border, and Ms May, the prime minister, has acknowledged that a unilateral British commitment not to create new barriers was not enough to resolve the issue.Mr Rees-Mogg said he disagreed with the prime minister and dismissed the EU’s argument that its rules demanded that it should police its external borders and protect the integrity of the single market and the customs union.“It wasn’t possible for Italy to join the euro. But lo and behold the rules were waived. It was not possible for Greece to join the euro, but lo and behold Goldman Sachs fiddled the figures and Greece joined. The four freedoms are inisible, except when it comes to the association agreement with Ukraine, when lo and behold the freedom of movement of people – oh dear, we are not going to have that,” he said.\u0026nbsp“This is one of those things we must not fall for. The EU says this is EU law. It is holy writ. Moses has brought it down from the Alps, when he was not busy in the Sinai, and therefore it must be obeyed. Whenever it is convenient to the European Union, European law is adjusted. It is political rather than legal.’’Mr Rees-Mogg said that, considering its long history with Ireland, Britain should not do anything that risks security or damages the Irish economy. He noted Britain’s importance as a trading partner for Ireland, particularly in agriculture, and warned of the consequences if the EU made Britain subject to the common external tariff.“There would be up to 70 per cent tariffs on Irish beef ... I cannot believe there is any wish that the Irish Government has any wish for any of this to happen. Therefore I think we have to be very clear and say: we are not going to have a border, we’re going to carry on trading freely with you, what are you going to do?’’Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Stefan RousseauPATheresa May has spent much of this week struggling to reconcile the two ends of her party over Brexit, shuttling between former attorney general Dominic Grieve, who leads the pro-European rebels, and Brexiteer shop steward Jacob Rees-Mogg. But for Rees-Mogg, the 49-year-old Somerset MP who chairs the European Research Group (ERG) of up to 60 hard Brexiteers, negotiating with the EU couldn’t be simpler.“I think there’s a very straightforward deal actually. I think what we should say to the EU is: here’s £39 billion, and here’s a trade deal,” he says, forming each of his hands into a fist to demonstrate.\u0026nbsp“If you give us one, we’ll give you the other. If you don’t give us the other, we won’t give you one. And then, for 21 months of the multiannual financial framework negotiation, you’re going to have to get more money from other member states.”Once caricatured as a backbench Bertie Wooster on account of his fogeyish style, elongated vowels and reactionary outlook, Rees-Mogg is today one of the most influential MPs at Westminster. A consistent poll-topper in Conservative Home’s surveys of party members on who should be their next leader, he leads a caucus that could hold the prime minister’s fate in its hands.Rees-Mogg, whose father William edited the London Times and went on to become a Conservative peer, made a fortune estimated in the tens of millions of pounds before becoming an MP. This week, it emerged that his investment company\u0026nbspSomerset Capital Management had launched a new investment vehicle in Dublin, which advised investors that a hard Brexit\u0026nbspcould affect it adversely. In any case, he doesn’t believe in the downside economic risks to Brexit, despite a warning from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) that a hard exit from the EU could wipe out entire sectors of the British economy.“The CBI represents incumbents. It doesn’t represent challengers, it doesn’t represent competition and if you represent incumbents, of course you want to maintain the cosy cartel that keeps prices high. But I’m on the side of my voters who are consumers and consumers want lower prices, lower tariffs, less obstructions to trade therefore non-tariff barriers too,” he says.For Rees-Mogg, leaving the EU is about much more than economics or day-to-day politics, it is about democracy itself. He says one of the most important questions every member of parliament faces is whether he can seek redress of grievance for his constituents.“And you can’t once it’s a European competence. Whereas when it’s a British competence you can raise it in the House of Commons, you can introduce a bill if you want to change the law. You have an active way of seeking redress of grievance for your constituents,” he says.The European Parliament is not, he claims, “a serious parliament” or a proper democratic forum because it doesn’t represent a single people.\u0026nbsp“There are the peoples of Europe, there’s not a single European people. If there were a European people, the Germans wouldn’t mind subsidising the Greeks. But they hate it,” he says.So is there a single British people? And is everyone in Northern Ireland part of it?“Yes there is. By a long-established history. Northern Ireland is part of the UK,” he says.\u0026nbsp“Some of them wish to leave. And they have, under the Belfast Agreement, the right to a referendum under certain circumstances”.But the agreement also gives them the right to identify as British or Irish or both, which would suggest that some of them have the right not to be part of the British people?“Well they have a vote in the British election but they don’t have to use it. We don’t have compulsory voting, and I don’t think we should,” he says.“I believe in the concept of nation-state. I think that’s where power validly belongs. And the people who belong to that nation-state have rights and duties within that nation-state, and the democracy applies to them. But I don’t believe that there is a European people that is willing to accept the burdens required for a single state.”“We would be in an association with it, which would not make us subject to the ECJ, the ECJ would have no writ in the UK, it would have a writ in the chemicals agency. And that is different from the current position where if the ECJ ruled on the chemicals agency that would automatically be UK law. Under those circumstances, it would not be UK law and could not affect what happened in the UK unless we decided that it would,” he says.“Voluntary alignment is fine because you can decide not to align if you think the regulation is going wrong,” he says.What Rees-Mogg is describing is similar to Switzerland’s relationship with the EU, which is governed by numerous bilateral treaties that offer the Swiss a measure of sovereignty in theory but leaves them in reality as rule-takers from Brussels.Despite the current chaos in Westminster and the slow progress of negotiations in Brussels, he believes that May will secure a deal from the EU.“My guess is that there will be a deal. I’m in favour of a deal but I’m not frightened of leaving without it,” he says.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Some 3,500 light-years away, meanwhile, the nearest black hole from our planet, 1A 0620-00, was preparing to receive a special message.Shortly after the noon service in London, scientists from the European Space Agency were to use the Cebreros antenna in central Spain to beam a recording of Prof Hawking’s voice giving a message of “peace and hope” to the black hole, his family said in a statement. The recording had been set to music by Greek composer Vangelis – famed for his Chariots of Fire and Blade Runner scores – and lasts six-and-a-half minutes.If traversing galaxies wasn’t indicative enough of Prof Hawking’s extraordinary influence and fame, the sheer range of guests arriving in Westminster earlier in the day certainly was. Alongside the scientist’s family, friends and former colleagues from Cambridge University were actors, musicians, politicians, astronauts and Nobel prize winners.There were also representatives from charities connected to Prof Hawking, including sufferers of motor neurone disease, the affliction that gradually paralysed him over 55 years, hundreds of schoolchildren, and one thousand members of the public, from more than 100 countries, who were invited to attend after a ballot attracted around 25,000 applications.Benedict Cumberbatch makes a speech at the memorial service for Professor Stephen HawkingMaking their way past media crews from around the world and the hundreds of onlookers gathered at the Great West Door at noon, well-known guests included the musicians Nile Rodgers and David Gilmour, Professor Brian Cox, the astronaut Tim Peake, the leader of the opposition, Jeremy Corbyn, and Benedict Cumberbatch, who arrived with his wife Sophie Hunter. In tribute, some of the guests wore ties or pins with stars and planets on.Inside, the hour-long service was conducted by The Very Reverend Dr John Hall, Dean of Westminster. An address was given by Astronomer Royal Martin Rees, who first met Prof Hawking at the University of Cambridge in the early 60s, while Prof Hawking\u0027s collaborator and Nobel prize winner Kip Thorne also gave a tribute.Congregants watched as a small box containing Prof Hawking’s ashes was interred in what’s become known as Scientists’ Corner, a section of the Abbey dedicated to the great and good of science. Choral music echoed through the grand building as family members, led by the Dean of Westminster, processed to Prof Hawking\u0027s final resting place.His daughter, Lucy, and first wife Jane Hawking, were among those who laid flowers, while a medal created by the Stephen Hawking Foundation was also placed in the grave next to the wooden casket.The area’s newest memorial stone bears the inscriptions, “Here lies what was mortal of Stephen Hawking, 1942-2018” and, per his request, his most famous equation, describing the entropy of a black hole. The words are a translation of the Latin on the nearby grave of Sir Isaac Newton.Designed by artist John Maine, it is made from Caithness slate from the north of Scotland and was chosen to represent deep space.Lucy Hawking, daughter of British scientist Stephen Hawking speaks at his memorial service during which his ashes will be buried in the nave of the Abbey churchProf Hawking\u0027s interment between Newton and Darwin marked the first time a well-known person has been laid to rest in the Abbey since Sir Laurence Olivier 29 years ago, and the first scientist since Joseph John Thomson, the discoverer of the electron, who died in 1940.Lord Rees said: Stephen described his own scientific quest as learning the mind of God, but this was a metaphor. He shared Darwin\u0027s agnosticism, but it is fitting that he too should be interred in this national shrine.His name will live in the annals of science. Nobody else since Einstein has done more to deepen our understanding of space, time and gravity.Millions have had their horizons widened by his books and lectures, and even more worldwide have been inspired by a unique example of achievement against all the odds.Cumberbatch, who played a young Prof Hawking in a 2004 BBC film, read a passage from Wisdom 7: 15-24, while Peake read from Percy Bysshe Shelley’s ‘Queen Mab’, ending with the lines, “In eloquent silence, through the depths of space  Pursued its wondrous way.”Appropriately, Shelley and Prof Hawking share the same alma mater, University College, Oxford, albeit 149 years apart. While the latter graduated with ease, however, Shelley was expelled after less than a year later for distributing a pamphlet on atheism. “It was a wonderful service, everything was so well chosen. The music, readings and tone was just right. I’m a great admirer of his work, but it was also so important for people with disabilities. It was a fitting send-off,” said David Edwards, 70, a guest who won his place through the ballot, afterwards.Adela Ksasna, 19, worked in communications for the Hawking Foundation for two years, and travelled from the USA to pay her respects to the man whose ideas she promoted around the world.“For me it was very personal and sad, especially at the committal, but it was a balance of respect and joy,” she said. “Ultimately it’s a happy day, though, because he so deserves to be there with Newton and Darwin, because that’s who he is equivalent to these days.”A private funeral service was held for Prof Hawking in Cambridge in March. At the age of just 22, he was diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease and given just a few years to live.His illness left him wheelchair-bound and dependent on a computerised voice system for communication.However, he defied all odds, going on to become a towering figure in the world of physics, a bestselling author particularly with his book A Brief History Of Time, a father of three and a TV celebrity.Stephen Hawking\u0026#039s funeral, in picturesPaying tribute to his friend and former colleague, Professor Thorne said: Stephen and I were very close friends for 43 years, he was by far the most stubborn friend I ever had.He absolutely refused to let his physical disability get in the way of doing great science or get in the way of having great fun.As guests filed out of the Abbey to a peel of bells, many looked up at the blue sky. Far above, Hawking was to live on. Only for now, though. Over billions of years, black holes emit radiation that shrinks their mass and energy, eventually seeing them disappear entirely. The process is known as Hawking radiation. 44 years ago, it was he who provided the argument for its existence.Brexit Bulletin: In defence of the so-called \u0026#39headbangers\u0026#39London

paras tell kremlin","story":"digitalservices@telegraphBritish paras from C Coy, 3 PARA jump into Latvia on Ex SABRE STRIKEDefence and Security correspondentMinistry of DefenceBritish troops have parachuted into Latvia in a dramatic display of force amid heightened tension with the Kremlin. Paratroopers completed the longest strategic parachute insertion ever undertaken by British forces as army chiefs said the exercise showed we are prepared.The Transatlantic deployment has been described as “a clear and unmistakable show of airborne strength on a global scale”.Men from C Company, 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment, flew almost 5,000 miles from Fort Bragg in the United States, to parachute into Latvia as part of a Nato exercise.British paras deployed alongside colleagues from the 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute Infantry Regiment, known as ‘1 Fury’, part of the US Army’s 82nd Airborne Division.U.S. Army paratroopers from 82nd Airborne Division and British paratroopers from 3 PARA, prepare to jump from a C-17 Globemaster over LatviaThe jump formed part of Exercise SABER STRIKE, a major US-led Nato training exercise involving around 18,000 troops from 19 member nations, that has taken place across the Baltic states over the last two weeks.The exercise ended on Friday with a live fire demonstration involving Polish F-16 fighter jets and MI-24 attack helicopters in Poland\u0027s Bemowo Piskie military training area, an hour\u0027s drive to the borders of the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and Belarus, an ally of Moscow.Major General Timothy McGuire, Deputy Commanding General of the US Army Europe, said the exercise was to show we are prepared.A British parachutist checks his American T-11 parachute prior to jumping into Latvia. The T-11 weighs 24kgs, 5.5kgs heavier than the standard British parachute, but allows the soldier to jump with more kit. About 100 personnel from the Colchester-based 16 Air Assault Brigade had earlier parachuted into the Adazi training area in Latvia in what has been hailed a major confidence building measure between British and American airborne forces.Speaking to the , Colonel Andrew Jackson, Deputy Commander of Britain’s 16 Air Assault Brigade, said the UK and US forces had integrated with little difficulty.A US soldier checks the kit of a C Company Para“Sharing kit was less of a challenge,” he said. The exercise allowed for dynamic in-flight mission planning whilst over the Atlantic. “It was a real eye-opener,” he said, but C Company showed they could “plug into” any part of the US 82nd Airborne Division.“They earned credits in the bank.”A British para, flanked by members of 1 Fury, exits the drop zone“There’s a reason why most of the world’s reference armies still maintain an airborne capability,” said Colonel Jackson.“In strategic terms it’s not possible to get this many men and this much equipment anywhere on the globe so quickly by any other means. This is a very public statement that the 82nd Airborne Division GRF (Global Response Force), with 16 Brigade as part of it, is able to project significant force at short notice.”British and American paratroopers training to fight alongside each other. The British SA-80 rifle weighs about 5kgs.Exercising alongside the American 82nd Airborne Division was designed develop interoperability and hone the participating soldiers’ understanding of British and American tactics and operating procedures.The British paras flew in nine american C-17 Globemaster aircraft. Although Britain has these aircraft also, they are used primarily for moving troops between operational theatres rather than as paratroop despatchers.The lead para carries a Javelin anti-tank weapon: the missile and launch tube weighs around 22kgs, and the Command Launch Unit, which is carried separately, is 6-7kgs.

Very funny.”Aside from making predictions, Ms Stevens previously said Marcus has a “lovely chilled out personality” and has “produced some lovely piglets”.She added: “I love micro pigs because they are so intelligent and so cute and sweet. In my view they are by far the most amazing pets you could wish to own.”World Cup 2018 | Fixtures, groups, squads and moreHowever, her pet’s predictions haven’t always been accurate, with Marcus wrongly backing Derby County to beat Hull City in the Championship play-off semi-final in 2016, a match the Rams lost 3-0.His prediction for this year’s tournament will also ultimately prove to be incorrect, with his four teams picked unable to all reach the semi-final due to clashes in the quarter-finals, if they all make it that farMarcus joins a long list of animals with reputed psychic powers, including Paul the octopus oracle, who correctly predicted the results of 12 matches at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.This year, a Russian cat named Achilles correctly predicted the winner of the competition’s first game between the host nation and Saudi Arabia.

The consumer group said this means that there should be a “robust consultation” with a bank’s customers before financial services are removed from an area.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

New research suggests a vital link between our ability to sense our physical bodies and knowing how we feelClick to followThe Independent OnlineSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autismStephen has been married twice. Two wedding days. Two “I do”s. Yet Stephen has no happy memories from either – or, in fact, from the marriages or any of his relationships.\u0026nbspHe met his first wife on a pre-nursing course when he was just 16. Six years later, they were married. Three years after that, they got orced she was never really the right one for him, he says.Almost two decades on, in 2009, he met his second wife through a dating site. He threw himself into the relationship and, the following year, with his father and her two adult siblings present, they married at the registrar’s office in Sheffield, where they both live.\u0026nbspHe put on smiles for the wedding photos because he recognised that they were expected but, as he explains: “From an inner feeling point of view, anything I do that requires an emotional response feels like a fake.“Most of my responses are learned responses. In an environment where everyone is being jolly and happy, it feels like I’m lying. Acting. Which I am. So it is a lie.”\u0026nbspHappiness isn’t the only emotion that Stephen struggles with. Excitement, shame, disgust, anticipation, even love… he doesn’t feel these, either. “I feel something but I’m unable to distinguish in any real way what that feeling is.” The only emotions he is familiar with are fear and anger.\u0026nbspSuch profound problems with emotion are sometimes associated with autism, which Stephen does not have, or with psychopathy, which he doesn’t have, either.Last year, at the age of 51, he finally learned what he does have: a little-known condition called alexithymia, a word made from Greek parts meaning, roughly, “no words for emotion”.Despite the name, the real problem for people with alexithymia isn’t so much that they have no words for their emotions, but that they lack the emotions themselves. Still, not everyone with the condition has the same experiences. Some have gaps and distortions in the typical emotional repertoire.Some realise they’re feeling an emotion, but don’t know which, while others confuse signs of certain emotions for something else – perhaps interpreting butterflies in the stomach as hunger pangs.\u0026nbspSurprisingly, given how generally unrecognised it is, studies show that about one in 10 people fall on the alexithymia spectrum. New research is now revealing what’s going wrong – and this work holds the promise not only of novel treatments for disorders of emotion, but of revealing just how the rest of us feel anything at all.\u0026nbspAfter working as a nurse for 10 years, Stephen decided he wanted to do something different. A two-year Access to University course led to a degree in astronomy and physics, and then to a job testing computer games.He built a successful career for himself, working for various companies in their computer testing departments, managing teams, and travelling around the world to speak at conferences. He had no problem conveying facts to colleagues.It was in the context of more personal relationships – or any other scenario that would typically involve expressions of emotion – that he felt things were “wrong”.\u0026nbsp“At the beginning of a relationship, I’m totally into who that person is,” he explains. “I’ve been told I’m very good at maintaining a honeymoon period for ‘longer than expected’. But after a year it takes a massive turn. It all falls apart. I’ve put myself on a pedestal to be this person which I’m really not. I react mostly cognitively, rather than it being emotions making me react. Obviously, that is not valid. It’s not real. It seems fake. Because it is fake. And you can only pretend for so long.”\u0026nbspHe and his current wife stopped living together in 2012. He saw a GP and was prescribed antidepressants. Though he was still in contact with his wife, it was clear that the relationship was no longer working. In June 2015, he attempted suicide.“I had actually been posting on Facebook and Twitter regarding killing myself and someone – I’ve never found out who – contacted the police. I was taken to hospital and treated.”\u0026nbspA psychiatrist referred Stephen for a series of counselling sessions and then a course of psychodynamic psychotherapy, a type of Freudian-based therapy that, in trying to uncover unconscious drivers of thoughts and behaviour, is similar to psychoanalysis.\u0026nbspIt was in a book called Why Love Matters by Sue Gerhardt, which his therapist recommended, that he first came across the concept of alexithymia.“I brought it up in therapy, and that’s when we started talking about how I was very alexithymic. Obviously, I’ve got a vocabulary. I’ve got words for emotions. But whether they’re the right words for the right emotion is a different point altogether… I just thought that I wasn’t good at talking about how I feel and emotions and stuff like that. But after a year of therapy, it became apparent that when I talk about emotions I don’t actually know what I’m talking about.”The term “alexithymic” dates from a book published in 1972 and has its origins in Freudian psychodynamic literature.Freudian ideas are now out of favour with most academic psychologists, as Geoff Bird, a professor of psychology at the University of Oxford explains. “Not to disrespect those traditions, but in the cognitive, neuro, experimental field, not so many people are really very interested in anything associated with Freud any more.”But when Bird read about alexithymia, he found the descriptions intriguing. “Actually, it’s really quite amazing.” For most people, “at a low level of emotion, you might be a bit unsure about exactly what you’re feeling, but if you have a strong emotion, you know what it is”. And yet somehow, here were people who simply did not know.\u0026nbspBird started his academic career studying autism spectrum disorder, empathy and emotional awareness, which led to his interest in alexithymia.In one of his first studies in this field, he linked alexithymia, as measured with a 20-item checklist developed at the University of Toronto, with a lack of empathy. If you can’t feel your own emotions in the typical way, it makes sense that you can’t identify with those of others, either.\u0026nbspBut what really drew Bird into alexithymia research were his interactions with people with autism. “There has been this perception that people with autism don’t have empathy. And that’s rubbish. And you can see that immediately as soon as you meet some autistic people.”In a series of studies, Bird has found that about half of people with autism have alexithymia – it’s these people who struggle with emotion and empathy, while the rest do not. In other words, emotion-related difficulties are intrinsic to the alexithymia, not to the autism.Bird is passionate about spreading this message. He talks with feeling about one particular autistic study volunteer who did not have alexithymia: “A lovely guy with an IQ we couldn’t measure, it’s that good. He couldn’t hold down a job. But he volunteered to work at a care home because he wanted to do something productive with his time.“They said, ‘Oh because you’ve got a diagnosis of autism you can’t do empathy, therefore you can’t look after our elderly people.’ Which is just ridiculous.”\u0026nbspBird has since run a series of studies exploring alexithymia outside the context of autism. He has found, for example, that people with the condition have no trouble recognising faces, or distinguishing pictures of people smiling and frowning.“But for a few of our really alexithymic people, while they can tell a smile and a frown apart, they have no idea what they are. That is really quite strange.”\u0026nbspMany of the people with the condition who Bird has met talk about being told by other people that they’re different, though some do recognise it in themselves early on.“I guess it’s a bit like not being able to see colour, and everybody’s always banging on about how red this is or how blue, and you come to realise there’s an aspect of human experience that you’re just not participating in.”As well as better characterising alexithymia, Bird and his colleagues have also dug into what explains it, taking what could seem to be a circular argument – Stephen has problems with emotion because he has alexithymia, which is characterised by problems with emotion – and blowing it right apart.In situations that Stephen recognises as being in theory highly emotional – like telling someone “I love you” – he experiences changes inside his body. “I feel my heart race and this rush of adrenaline, but to me that feeling is always scary. I don’t know how to react. It makes me want to either run away or react verbally aggressively.”\u0026nbspFear and anger – and confusion – he understands. “Everything else just feels all the same… it’s this feeling of, ‘Errrr, I’m not quite comfortable with this – it’s not quite right’.”\u0026nbsp“Similarly with anxiety, it might be that someone experiences an emotional response associated with a fast heartbeat – which might be excitement – but they don’t know how to interpret that, and they could panic about what’s happening in their body.”\u0026nbspThe ability to detect changes inside the body – everything from a racing heart to a ersion of blood flow, from a full bladder to a distension of the lungs – is known as interoception. It’s your perception of your own internal state.\u0026nbspDifferent emotions are associated with different physical changes. In anger, for example, the heart rate rises, blood rushes to the face, and fists clench. In fear, the heart rate also rises but blood drains from the face.It’s generally thought that these changes are not entirely specific to inidual emotions, and so context is also important: if you feel your heart racing and you’re looking at a spider, you know it’s fear that you’re feeling, not sexual arousal.\u0026nbspWhat Bird, Brewer and others have found in people with alexithymia is a reduced ability, sometimes a complete inability, to produce, detect or interpret these internal bodily changes. People with the condition have normal-range IQs.They can understand as well as anyone else that they’re seeing a spider, rather than an attractive potential partner. But either their brains aren’t triggering the physical changes that it seems are needed for the experience of an emotion, or other regions of their brains aren’t reading these signals properly.\u0026nbspIn 2016, Bird and Brewer, along with Richard Cook at City University in London, published a research paper that characterised alexithymia as a “generalised deficit of interoception”.Here, then, was an explanation for these people’s problems with emotion – but also, in effect, a manifesto stating that the perception of a range of bodily signals is important for the experience of emotion in the rest of us.\u0026nbspIt’s an idea that we already express in everyday language: in English, for an apology to mean anything, it has to be “heartfelt”. If you truly love someone, it’s with “all your heart”.When you’re really angry, your “blood boils”. Instead of saying that you’re anxious, you might talk about having “butterflies in your stomach” (thought to be caused by a ersion of blood flow away from the digestive system).While most people may not be familiar with alexithymia, there is a different disorder involving flat emotions and poor empathy that seems to fascinate us, even more than it repels us: psychopathy. Can we learn more about how we feel by understanding psychopaths?Lieke Nentjes is in her early thirties. She’s slender and softly spoken it’s hard to picture her spending countless hours in small rooms with incarcerated, unshackled psychopaths, including serially violent men who have committed murder.\u0026nbsp“Then he explained that he was at the end of his therapy and was ‘resocialising’ and no one would hire him because they were intimidated by him. He wasn’t really angry. He was frustrated.”While the nature of psychopathy is still debated, psychologists generally agree that it entails, among other things, a lack of empathy or guilt, shallow emotions, and antisocial behaviour – treating other people badly and, in some cases, engaging in criminal acts.\u0026nbspIt has certainly been suggested that the reason some psychopaths are able to torture or murder people is that they don’t process emotions properly – they don’t feel fear, for example, and they don’t recognise it in others.\u0026nbspNentjes is based at the University of Amsterdam. Here in the Netherlands, if a criminal is found to have a psychological condition that relates to the crime, he or she is deemed to be only partially responsible.Such criminals might spend a few years in a regular jail before being sent to a secure treatment centre, or they may be sent straight for treatment.\u0026nbspNentjes decided to assess a range of criminals from these centres and from jails to find out just how psychopathic they were (with particular attention to different aspects of psychopathy), to learn about their lives – their upbringing, and their criminal behaviour – and also to measure their interoceptive ability.\u0026nbsp“Emotion is very central when you look at psychopathy – or rather, lack of emotion,” she says. So could it be that psychopathic offenders just aren’t very in touch with their bodies?\u0026nbspIn the course of the interviews, Nentjes asked questions to probe their levels of empathy, and how much remorse they felt about what they had done to their victims. “Some were just completely honest, and would say, ‘I don’t care,’” she says.“Others who were psychopathic would say, ‘Oh, but I’m very empathic.’ They had learned the lingo to describe feelings very accurately and they could talk about compassionate, empathic feelings towards others – but then when you look at the crimes they have committed…” Her sentence trails off.\u0026nbsp“There is research finding that psychopathic offenders can describe emotions in terms of words, but they lack the inner experience of the emotion,” she adds.\u0026nbspSince assessing a person’s ability to detect a range of bodily signals is tricky, the most commonly used measures of interoceptive sensitivity are based on judgements of heart rate. One test involves asking participants to count their heartbeats over varying periods – 25 or 50 seconds, perhaps – multiple times.About 10 per cent of us are good at counting heartbeats, 5 to 10 per cent are very bad, and the rest fall somewhere in between.In another test, volunteers are played a series of beeps that are either in sync or out of sync with their heartbeat, and asked which it is. On this type of task, about 10 per cent of the general population can do it really well, and 80 per cent can’t do it at all.\u0026nbspNentjes brought the necessary equipment for the heartbeat synch task with her into the interview rooms, and took measures for 75 offenders. She found a clear link: the higher an offender’s score on the antisocial aspect of psychopathy, the poorer their performance on the heart-rate task.This does at least suggest that psychopaths who are poorer at detecting bodily signals feel less emotion and therefore less empathy for others.Psychopathic criminals are sometimes ided into the “white-collar” type, who tend to commit non-violent crimes such as fraud, and the violent type. In her interviews with this violent group, Nentjes was struck by one similarity, in particular, compared with the white-collar group.“That was their upbringing. Or rather lack of it. Emotional abuse. Sexual abuse. Neglect. A lot of physical abuse. I’ve heard people literally say that emotion is not of use to them. All they felt during their upbringing was fear.”\u0026nbspAs a child, Stephen suffered extreme emotional neglect. When he was six, his mother intentionally set fire to their home in Nottingham while she, Stephen, his younger brother and even younger sister were all inside. Fortunately, the children’s father, who had left for work, realised that he’d forgotten his packed lunch and came home.\u0026nbspLooking back, Stephen says it’s clear that his mother was suffering from post-natal depression. But she received no treatment, “and all I knew was anxiety and being worried”. After the fire, his mother went to prison. His father was a steelworker, who worked all kinds of shifts.“A neighbour contacted social services and Dad was told to sort it out or they’d take us away. None of my dad’s brothers or sisters wanted me or my brother because we were little shits. We were always in trouble. Robbing shops. All kinds of stuff. So we went into care.”\u0026nbspFor the rest of his childhood, Stephen was in and out of care homes. The only emotions he remembers feeling, even then, are fear, anger and confusion. “Christmas, birthdays, people out of the blue at care homes being nice to me… I never really got used to it. I always felt uncomfortable. There’s just a mess of feelings inside me that I don’t interpret properly, or respond to properly.”\u0026nbspAlexithymia is often associated with trauma and neglect from a young age, explains Geoff Bird. Twin studies have suggested a genetic component, too. And it’s also linked to certain types of brain damage, particularly to the insula, the region that receives interoceptive signals.\u0026nbspAs Rebecca Brewer notes, the kind of anxiety that Stephen experiences is common in people with poor interoception. At the University of Sussex, Hugo Critchley and Sarah Garfinkel, who have expertise in psychiatry and neuroscience, are looking at ways to alter interoception, to bring anxiety down.\u0026nbspGarfinkel has put forward a three-dimensional model of interoception that has been well received by others in the field. First, objective accuracy at perceiving interoceptive signals – how good you are at counting heartbeats, for example.Second, subjective report – how good you think you are. And third, metacognitive accuracy – how good you are at knowing how good you actually are.\u0026nbspThe third dimension is important because various studies have found that the gap between how good someone thinks they are at counting heartbeats, for example, and how good they actually are predicts their levels of anxiety.Lisa Quadt, a research fellow with the Sussex group, is now running a clinical trial with the aim of testing whether reducing this gap for people with autism can reduce their anxiety.In a pilot study, Critchley, Garfinkel and MSc student Abigail McLanachan recruited a group of students who came into the lab for six training sessions. In each session, they first did the heartbeat-counting task.The volunteer sat at rest, with a loose rubber pulse oximeter on their forefingers, and reported how many beats they’d counted. Then McLanachan told them how they’d done so that they got a better sense of how accurate they were.McLanachan then got them to do a few minutes of jumping jacks or walking fast up the steep hill outside the building – whatever was necessary to raise their heart rate, to make it easier to detect. (“Because some people really can’t feel their heartbeat at all. I can’t,” Quadt explains.)Then they went back into the lab, did the tasks again and, as before, were given feedback each time.\u0026nbspThis was just a pilot study on a general student population. But after three weeks, not only had the students’ accuracy improved on all three dimensions of interoception, but they also reported reductions in anxiety of around 10 per cent.\u0026nbspFor the main trial, volunteers diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder will complete the same tasks as in the pilot, but once at the start and once at the end they’ll do them inside an MRI scanner.This will allow the team to monitor activity in the insula, which receives heart-rate data, and look at how changes in that activity may correspond to connections between the amygdala, which detects threats, and the prefrontal cortex, which can work out whether a potential threat really is or is not dangerous and so whether anxiety is warranted.The hope, Critchley explains, is to see improved connectivity between these two regions, which previous studies have linked to reduced anxiety.\u0026nbspIn Oxford, meanwhile, Geoff Bird wants to look at the idea that there are two different types of alexithymia. People with one type don’t produce enough of the bodily signals necessary for the experience of an emotion, so would be unlikely to benefit from the Sussex group’s kind of training.People with the other type produce all kinds of bodily sensations but their brains don’t process these signals in the typical way. This second group, which includes Stephen, might benefit more.\u0026nbspBird stresses that, although people with alexithymia struggle to understand emotion, that doesn’t mean they don’t care about other people. “For the most part, iniduals with alexithymia can recognise that others are in a negative state, and this makes them distressed.“The problem is that they can’t work out what the other person is feeling, and what they are feeling, and therefore how to make the other person feel better or how to reduce their own distress. I think that’s important because alexithymia is different from psychopathy in that respect.”Stephen says that for him, this is certainly true. And in theory, an emotional training technique is something he would welcome. “I’ve got several books about emotions and feelings and they don’t make a jot of difference because they’re not talking specifically enough about what you actually feel within your body is which emotion.”\u0026nbspFor now, given the absence of available treatments for alexithymia, Stephen plans to use his newfound understanding of himself, gained through therapy, to try to move forwards. At first, he says, he hoped that therapy would fix everything.“I thought every day would be perfect, brilliant… and I’ve come to realise that’s not going to happen. I’m always going to have problems, always going to have issues.”\u0026nbspHe’s learned valuable lessons, he says. Though he and his wife are still separated, they talk regularly and now he tries not to reject her views on his anxiety. “Rather than go, ‘No,’ I will listen. I think, ‘Well, you know what emotions are about and I don’t, so I’m going to listen to you and I’ll either take it on board or I’ll find a way to deal with it’.”He’s also thinking about moving to work with people who are struggling with substance abuse, because he’d like to be back in a career where he can help people.\u0026nbspMost of all, he’s determined to use his diagnosis of alexithymia. “For me, it empowers me – now I know about it, I can read about it.

Flat desert on either side, a few lights.\u0026nbspThe Moroccan traveller Ibn Battuta passed this way on camel back in 1326, and wrote of its emphatic wilderness: “He who enters it is lost and he who leaves it is born.”Before mass tourism ruined them for a second time, I’d travelled to the so-called “lost” cities of Petra, Machu Picchu and Angkor Wat.\u0026nbspMy destination tonight was the isolated sandstone valley eulogised by Charles Doughty, the first European to enter it\u0026nbspin 1876, as “the fabulous Mada’in Saleh\u0026nbspwhich I was come from far countries to seek in Arabia”.The prospect of following in Doughty’s flapping shadow gave me a jolt of anticipation that I hadn’t experienced since my twenties.\u0026nbspDoughty’s classic book Arabia Deserta was championed by his friend TE\u0026nbspLawrence, who later used it as a military textbook, as the greatest record of adventure and travel in our language.It begins with Doughty trying to smuggle himself into Mada’in Saleh in the guise of a poor Syrian pilgrim.\u0026nbspEven up until recently few Europeans have visited this cradle of forgotten civilisations, which, though designated a World Heritage Site in 2008, remains a blank page on the archaeological record, closed off by geography, politics, religion.“Visitors last year from abroad? I can say zero,” my guide Ahmed tells me.Mada\u0027in\u0026nbspSaleh\u0026nbspnear Al-Ula\u0026nbsphave survived for 2,000 yearsThis is set to change. Last July, under the impetus of Saudi Arabia’s progressive new Crown Prince, Mohammed Bin Salman, or “MBS” as he is popularly known, a Royal Commission took charge of Mada’in Saleh and its surrounds – “the only crown jewel of a site the country possesses,” says one of the archaeologists recruited to excavate it.In December, public access was halted first in order to survey what actually is there, next to develop a strategy for protecting it, and then to open up Mada’in Saleh to the outside world. My advance visit is aimed at providing an amuse-bouche, as it were.In the bright morning sunlight, Ahmed escorts me through locked gates, past the German-built railway-line linking Damascus with Medina, which Lawrence bombed (“there are still local tribes which call their sons Al-Orans”), to the celebrated Nabatean rock tombs.Doughty first heard about these in Petra, 300 miles north. Fifty years earlier, an awe-struck British naval commander had gazed in disbelief at Petra’s imperishable Treasury, murmuring, as many continue to do: “There is nothing in the world that resembles it.” He was wrong.If a little less rosier than her sister city, Mada’in Saleh shares her capacity to stagger.\u0026nbspOut of the flat desert, one after another, the ornate facades rise into sight, 111 of them, carved into perpendicular cliffs up to four storeys high, their low doorways decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century AD, with Greek triangles, Roman pilasters, Persian flowers, Egyptian sphinxes, birds.“This is a twin to Petra,” Ahmed says. Except that in Petra we would be bobbing among crowds.Ahmed\u0026nbspis descended from a long line of imamsStanding in reverent silence, with the valley to ourselves, I recall how the Victorian artist who supplied the first images of Petra to the world, David Roberts, responded to that other city. “I turned from it at length with an impression which will be effaced only by death.”These tombs were carved for the Nabatean tribes who ruled this region for 300 years until the Romans annexed them in 106AD. Nomads who had settled and grown wealthy, the Nabateans controlled the lucrative spice route from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea.Then, like the civilisations they’d replaced, the Dedanites, the Lihyanites, the Thamuds, they galloped off into obscurity. Their tombs were looted: the acacia doors plundered for firewood, the marble statues melted to make lime for plaster, the porphyry urns smashed.All that survives of their caravan city, Hegra, is a flat expanse behind a wire fence: “her clay-built streets are again the blown dust in the wilderness,” Doughty wrote.The same desolation holds true for the still more ancient Biblical city of Dedan, situated on the lip of an oasis a few minutes drive way. To visit both sites is to gain the sense of a narrative even now being worked out.\u0026nbspUntil the 20th\u0026nbspcentury the story of these civilisations was scrawled on the rocks in Nabatean or Thamudic script. Ahmed leads me between two steep cliffs to the oldest inscription, written 6,000 years ago.Tombs in Mada\u0027in Saleh were decorated by Alexandrian masons in the first century with Greek, Roman and Persian symbolsThe ancient Biblical city of Dedan is situated on the lip of an oasisCliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes such as elephants, mushrooms, and sealsAncient Dedan inscriptions.

Ahmed could be speaking of the cavity in the historical record when he says, “They were making sacrifices to one god, Dhu-Ghaibat, which means ‘the one who is absent’.”Out in the desert, the wind has chiselled its own mysterious deities and hieroglyphs. The scene is stunning. In Petra, which forms part of the same massif, David Roberts threw away his pencil in despair at being able to convey it, believing that the ruins “sink into insignificance when compared with these stupendous rocks”.It’s hard to disagree. Cliffs formed out of red and black sandstone have eroded into crazy, hallucinatory shapes: elephants, mushrooms, braying seals. If they were transcribed into music, it would be Wagnerian.They make you believe in mountain gods, I tell Ahmed, who smiles. “I never try smoking weed, but when I hear someone react, I feel like that. It makes you high, naturally.”For sheer high spirits, no one yields to the British archaeologist I meet that night. Jamie Quartermain is part of an international team employed since March to survey these sites.A surveyor who pioneered the use of drones, Quartermain says: “We’ve been wanting to get involved here, but Saudi has been a closed shop, a completely untapped reserve.The perception is that it’s big, open desert. When I tried to find out anything about it, there was essentially one book. The discovery that there are so many archaeological sites is a big shock for most people. It was a big shock for me.”Advised by the Royal Commission to expect 450 unexcavated sites, Quartermain estimates the truer number between 6,000-10,000.\u0026nbsp“The survival of the archaeology is remarkable, some of the best condition remains I’ve ever seen. We’re not finding it close to the surface, it’s above surface, well and truly visible.”Dedan\u0026nbspinscriptions. Holes in the rock floor denote a sacrificial spot from the time of the DedanitesDeploying a drone, he has begun creating a three-dimensional textural surface of the area. Already, what he has found is ground-breaking. “You can see all the archaeology jumping out and biting you on the bottom.”When, aged 20, I visited Petra, sleeping in one of the caves, I talked to the head of the Bdoul tribe, allegedly descendants of the Nabateans, who told me: “We have a saying that the more wealth you have, the more brain cells you need to be able to cope with it.What impresses about MBS’s plan for Mada’in Saleh is his determination to use his nation’s resources to avoid the pitfalls of Petra.“Wadi Rum is pretty disastrous,” says Chris Tuttle, an American archaeologist seconded to the project. Tuttle spent many years excavating in Petra. He saw at first hand the ruinous impact of tourism, both on the ruins and the local community.By contrast, in Al-Ula, the local town for Mada’in Saleh, there has been a concerted drive to educate the locals, giving scholarships to 150 children, but also to attract experts armed with the latest methodolOne reason for the blankness on Saudi Arabia’s archaeological map, says Tuttle, has been the resistance of conservative religious leaders to question their history. “You don’t need to study the past when you’ve been given a manual from God.”Suddenly, a multi-thousand-year-old story has become an open book, not a closed one, and the revelation it contains could be a complex of sites more significant even than Petra.\u0026nbspMy guide Ahmed Alimam is a perfect representative of Al-Ula’s past and future. He comes from a long line of imams descended from a grand tribal judge who arrived c1400 in Al Ula’s “old town”Abandoned in 1983, the year of Ahmed’s birth, this haunting labyrinth of mud houses and twisting streets replaced Dedan and Hegra. It was built using stones from those cities. They can be seen fortifying the occasional doorway.Ahmed leads the way down an empty street to the house where his parents used to live – collapsed beams, upturned crates. He shows me the mosque, erected over the spot where the Prophet Mohammed stopped in 630AD, and with a goat bone drew in the sand the direction of Medina Ahmed’s uncle was the last imam.Iranians are angry with Israel and Saudi Arabia, not just TrumpSaudi Arabia to build giant $9bn oil complex with French company TotalSaudis \u0027to cut off Qatar\u0027 with canal, nuclear dump and military baseSaudi Arabian Prince toured Hollywood and Harvard on trip to USAnd a modern inscription: the name “Charles”, scratched on the oat-coloured mud wall not, as momentarily I’d hoped, by Charles Doughty, but by Prince Charles (in 2015, with his key), and below it the Islamic translation.During the Islamic period, Al-Ula, or El-Ally as Doughty knew it, became an important station on the haj road south, and marked the last place where Christians were permitted to travel.\u0026nbspIbn Battuta described how pilgrim caravans paused here for four days to resupply and wash, and to leave any excess baggage with the townspeople “who are known for their trustworthiness”.“I hope we are still doing our best to be like that,” Ahmed says. “You can try, if you want, to leave something.”The only thing I left behind after my four days here was an urge to come back.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

She has previously told The Independent she\u0026nbspwants to keep Britain in the customs union and single market, a stance which could put her at odds with Jeremy Corbyn.Labour retained a majority of 5,629, far below the 21,213 won by Heidi Alexander in the 2017 general election. Ms Alexander triggered the by-election when she took a job in City Hall as Sadiq Khan\u0027s deputy mayor for transport.And with just 33 per cent of eligible voters turning out to cast their ballots, the remain-backing Liberal Democrats saw more than a five-fold increase in their vote share, leap-frogging the Conservatives into second place.Speaking to reporters after the result was declared, Ms Daby said she had found voters in Lewisham still did not want to leave the EU, let alone face a hard Brexit putting up barriers to trade with the rest of Europe.Her victory showed that we will not tolerate an extreme Brexit in Lewisham East”, Ms Daby said.Explaining her experience on the doorstep during the campaign, she said: One of the ongoing issues is to do with Brexit and people not wanting an extreme Brexit and ideally people not even wanting to leave the EU.I will oppose an extreme or a hard Brexit. I will consider people\u0027s jobs, the economy and people\u0027s rights and that will dictate to me the precedent in how I will conduct myself both within Parliament and out of Parliament.Grenfell represents everything wrong with country, says CorbynCorbyn suffers biggest Brexit rebellion as six frontbenchers resignLabour MP Heidi Alexander resigns to become London deputy mayorLeaving Europe \u0027could slash billions from NHS budget\u0027Janet Daby wins Labour candidacy for Lewisham East byelectionMs Daby faced stiff competition to be on the Labour ticket from Lewisham’s powerful branch of the pro-Corbyn movement Momentum. Asked if she would clash with the party leader over Brexit, she pointed out that she had voted for Mr Corbyn at two Labour leadership elections.“Obviously within politics not everybody will agree on everything,” she said. “For me it\u0027s about ensuring that we have as close a relationship to the EU as possible and that\u0027s what I\u0027ll be arguing for and that\u0027s what I\u0027ll be putting forward my views on.”Despite the victory, there will be concerning signs for the party in Ms Daby’s vote share of 50.2 per cent - down from the 67.9 per cent won by Ms Alexander in 2017, when turnout was 69.3 per cent.The Lib Dems heralded the nearly 19 per cent swing to them from Labour, as well as the collapse in Conservative support, as showing who “the real opposition here” was.Brexit: 10 of the most ridiculous headlinesThis wholly false headline merited the first ruling by IPSO (the press regulator) under clause 1 of the revised Editor\u0027s Code of Practice. Clause 1  makes specific reference to newspapers printing headlines not supported by the textIn perhaps the most notorious front page of the past few years, the Mail derides the High Court judges who ruled that parliament must have a vote on whether to trigger article 50 and start the Brexit processIn the Express\u0027 take on the same story, they manage to incorporate the Union Jack, allude to First World War propaganda, invoke memories of Churchill and, of course, state Brexit means BrexitThe Sun marked the day on which Mrs May triggered article 50 by projecting a huge and terrible pun on to the Cliffs of DoverReferencing their notorious eurosceptic headline from 1990 (See: Up Yours Delors), the Sun stokes the flames of the brief Gibraltar dispute, a dispute in which Spain, the supposed aggressors, only joined to note that there was no need for itThis headline followed Mrs May\u0027s snap election announcement, which gave the Mail hope that dissenting opinions on Brexit would disappearIn recent months, the Mail has often forgone catchy headlines in favour of rambling rants, this is an early example aimed at Tory Brexit rebelsThis headline (?) takes aim at the Lords over their repeated amendments to the EU Withdrawal BillOn the day that the EU Withdrawal Bill is to be debated in the Commons, the Sun offers two choices to MPs, desperately including all conceivable imagery that might make Brits feel patriotic, which apparently includes the Loch Ness MonsterOn the same day, the Express lets MPs know what the consequences of the vote may beTheir candidate, Lucy Salek, said the by-election was “about recognising that the people have a final say on Brexit”. She said: “We have turned around a massive increase in our vote share. We\u0027re back and people are starting to notice.”Vince Cable, the Lib Dem leader, said the result “sends a message to the Labour leadership that it cannot take pro-European voters for granted”.He said: “This is the largest swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats in over a decade and the failure of Labour\u0027s leadership to oppose the Conservatives\u0027 hard Brexit cannot be hidden or forgotten.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

This year is on track to overtake 2017, when 879 branches closed their doors for good, the research found.Access to banking services is further under threat from the possibility of cash machines being removed from communities as the result of changes to the way banks pay operators.This could lead to an estimated 2.7 million people who are almost totally reliant on cash struggling to access their preferred method of payment.The worst hit region is Scotland which will have seen 368 branches close in that period.Elsewhere, banks have closed 361 branches in the Southeast of England, 353 in the Northwest and 327 in the Southwest.

The consumer group said this means that there should be a “robust consultation” with a bank’s customers before financial services are removed from an area.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It is not about influencing the policy choices we make as we leave the EU.It is, instead, simply about ensuring the entire UK has a functioning statute book on the day we leave, the EU Exit Secretary said.Mr Davis urged peers to respect the clear will of the elected chamber about the Government\u0027s commitment to leaving the EU Single Market and customs union.We cannot accept anything which is not compatible with the manifesto on which the Government was elected last year, he wrote.David Davis made a plea for the unelected upper house to accept the votes of MPsHe also dismissed suggestions that the Government had welched on a deal with Tory rebel MPs led by former attorney general Dominic Grieve about accepting their call for parliamentary votes the outcome of the Brexit negotiations.He said the Government gave a commitment to put forward its own amendment on the issue for the House of Lords to debate on Monday. That is precisely what we have done, he said.Remainer peers, overwhelmingly in the majority in the Lords, are expected to back Lord Hailsham\u0027s amendment proposing binding parliamentary votes on the outcome of the Brexit talks with Brussels rather than the Government\u0027s alternative.Other amendments tabled yesterday included a demand for stronger guarantees on employment and consumer rights after Brexit put forward by Labour peer Baroness Hayter.Crossbench peer Lord Krebs tabled an amendment proposing firmer rules to protect the environment while senior judge Lord Pannick proposed keeping the EU\u0027s Charter of Fundamental Rights after Brexit.Remain-backing MPs were furious when a Government amendment promised to them by the Prime Minister in a private meeting during negotiations over the Bill earlier this week fell short of their demands for a meaningful vote.Stephen Hammond, one of the Tory rebels, yesterday urged Mrs May to honour her word.Mr Hammond told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that he expected talks on the issue to continue, adding: I\u0027m sure and I\u0027m convinced the Prime Minister intends to honour her word.What I think has happened is some people in the Government may have got involved in the process late in the day, people who weren\u0027t at that meeting, people who hadn\u0027t been involved earlier in the negotiations and who may unfortunately have hijacked the process.A Downing Street spokeswoman declined to comment on what was said at Mrs May\u0027s meeting with the rebels on Tuesday.The Prime Minister listened to those across the House who called for the ability to express their views in a \u0027no deal\u0027 scenario and we put forward an amendment which will be debated next week, said the spokeswoman.From our perspective, the amendment respects the tests set out by the Prime Minister and the Brexit Secretary."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/1/590x/Brexit-news-UK-no-deal-EU-European-Union-latest-today-974475.jpg","title":"Brexit news UK EU European Union Dominic Grieve meaningful vote no deal latest today","story":"Mr Ferrari attacked the Government\u0026rsquos approach to Brexit and insisted Britain should have just \u0026ldquojust walked out of the European Union and be done with Brexit.Speaking on Sky News The Pledge, Mr Ferrari said: \u0026ldquoJust get the damned thing done.

peak resulting in a summer of destruction for a third of the entire UK population.The April heatwave left a so-called pollen bomb lingering, which was the result of particular releases from birch, plane and oak trees.The spike caused millions of hay fever sufferers to be affected in the north, where the beast was born, before swooping in on the south of England where it settled before splitting.One half settled in Wales, and the other is laying in wait in the midlands where it dispels pollen across neighbouring areas and the entire south coast.Research revealed 57 percent of hay

food, spicy curries are known to help sweat out the common cold but bucket-loads of the Indian specialty is a great way of soothing hayfever symptoms too.Spices, hot peppers, chillis and wasabi are all excellent remedies because they contain capsaicin, which gives that notorious burning sensation that can be alleviated by downing a glass of milk.Speaking of milk, dairy products are best avoided when the symptoms of hay fever strike as they increase the production of mucus making sufferers extra phlegmy.Vaseline or petroleum jelly under the nostrils traps pollenWearing wraparound shades is

The most dangerous would be a mortal blow to the Government’s negotiating hand and could trigger a new election.Another one on Wednesday would be a giant step towards shackling ourselves forever inside an EU customs union, without any power over its decisions. That’s the worst possible Brexit, a catastrophe.Monday nights fudge between the two wings of the Tory party is still a risk — and merely postpones an inevitable showdown next month.In the end MPs must have faith in our great country, our extraordinary talent and our ability to thrive outside the EU. And, if they respect the democracy that has put them where they are, they must trust the decision we took.Todays “meaningful vote” amendment, if passed, would wreck the Government’s negotiating position in Brussels. That is already weak enough... Theresa May has made far too many compromises and is doing far too little to prepare Britain for a “no deal”. But this new move would be deadly.It would enable Parliament to reject any deal we strike with Brussels and force the Government to go back and keep negotiating. It would strip Mrs May of the power to walk away.The EU could offer us a derisory and punitive deal knowing Parliament had compelled the Government to accept it in the end. It would be like haggling with a used car salesman who knows you have to pay whatever he wants.The diehard Remainers running an orchestrated, multi-million pound campaign to keep Britain in the EU are relying on this vote to upend the process. It could trigger a second referendum or an election which Corbyn’s Marxist wrecking crew could win.Tory rebels must have nothing to do with it. It is their duty to give the Government the strongest possible hand in negotiating our exit and a future trade deal.Another vote on Wednesday seeks to push us into a restrictive customs union with the EU. That would place us permanently and powerlessly under Brussels’ control — with no say over it, nor any ability to sign our own deals around the world.Free trade with America, China, India, Australia, Canada and New Zealand? Forget it.Remain-backing MPs pretend this — and staying in the single market — represent “soft Brexit”, a compromise to reflect that 48 per cent voted Remain. But they are fatal to Brexit and they know it.Either would be a far worse deal than we have had before. They are a ruse to engineer a new vote to stay in.We get that Europhile MPs hate Brexit. But they are there to represent their voters, not advance personal agendas.For some Tories and many Labour MPs the decision should be blindingly obvious: their own constituencies voted Leave. The manifestos on which they then stood for election last year promised to leave both the single market and customs union.Do they seriously believe it right to betray their voters and their own doorstep promises?Most people are too busy to follow the daily ins and outs as the Brexit debate grinds on. Outside the London political bubble, they imagine it’s done and dusted. They just want to get on with leaving. And in full.It has barely occurred to them that many politicians never accepted the result, have waged war on it relentlessly and are closer than ever to victory.Imagine the explosion of anger if that happens. If, today or next month, Tory Remainers vote with Labour’s opportunists to defy the biggest democratic mandate in British history. If MPs, having approved the EU Withdrawal Bill once already, back wrecking amendments drafted by unelected peers bent on destroying Brexit.That rage won’t even be limited to Leavers. Many Remainers also consider it vital to fulfil the result of the vote in full. They know staying in the single market or customs union is not leaving. It is a suicidal, half-baked Brexit.Why would anyone trust our democracy again if we took such a course, in defiance of the referendum result?The Sun understands the Tory rebels’ fears for the economy and jobs post-Brexit. We believe we may well be in for a rocky ride short-term, before the longer-term benefits pan out.But everyone should read the authoritative view from ex-Aussie Prime Minister Tony Abbott — who initially backed Remain but is brimming with confidence over what he considers a golden opportunity for this country, even if we never strike any deal with Brussels.The Sun understands, too, the worries many Remainers have that Britain could become less ­liberal, less open and more prejudiced against foreign migrants after Brexit. We whole-heartedly believe that’s unfounded.Brits are becoming MORE welcoming, secure now in the knowledge we are at last about to get the same control over numbers every non-EU country enjoys.On these two ​vital days for Brexit — and further votes next month — The Sun says this to backbench Tories: Have faith in the people of Britain.They made the right decision on Brexit and they will make it work... if you allow your Government to give them the chance.THE most Eurosceptic people in Britain are calling on Theresa May to make good on her promise that Brexit means Brexit.The Lincolnshire town’s Tory MP Matt Warman was a Remainer but now advocates a “clean break” from Europe in agreement with 74.9 per cent of his constituents.Office worker Beverly Iles, 67, said: “We should have come straight out. We shouldn’t be still messing about with all this.”Retired council worker Brian Isam, 75, said: “We don’t need soft Brexit. We didn’t pay Europe a penny when we went in and we should not pay them a penny to get out.”THE people of Hull want Theresa May to wave goodbye to the Eurocrats now.In the East Yorkshire city, the leave vote was 68 per cent, although Labour MP Karl Turner was a Remainer.Happy Cakes manager Debbie Scaife, 56, said uncertainty had driven up the price of ingredients.She added: “Mrs May, I call on you to do this for us now.“The British public voted to leave. They didn’t want five years of hell.”Retailer Vicky Paddey, 37, said: “I voted for Brexit and I’m proud to say that — it was what people wanted then and they still want it now. If we end up with a soft Brexit, a lot of these shops in this city centre will not survive it.”IN the North East, some impatient voters are calling for dithering Mrs May to go.Voters in Gateshead went 56.8 per cent in favour of leaving in 2016, against the wishes of Labour MP Ian Mearns.Florist Dawn Athey, 41, said: “I think Theresa May should resign.“She’s not the person I thought she was going to be.“I think she’s scared of being the Prime Minister who’s going to take us out of the EU.”And Jude Ditchburn, 51, from Gateshead, said: “I think she is betraying the country and not doing what people want.FORMER Tory Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan is a leading Remoaner — but in her Leicestershire constituency people want to get on with Brexit.The area voted 50.1 per cent in favour of leaving the EU.Brexit backer Andrew Cooper, 56, said: “They are dragging their feet, the people have voted for this and they need to do what the people asked them to do.”Cedric Hewitt, 90, said: “I think Theresa May ought to get her finger out and get on with it. It’s what the British people wanted.”And David Greasley, 85, a former quality control engineer, said: “I voted out and simply want out.”HARD Brexit opponent and Conservative MP Anna Soubry wants Britain to be shackled with a customs union.Now, they want her party to carry out their wishes.Ray James, 82, and Elsie James, 80, said: “We think the Government are failing to get things sorted. It is taking a long, long time and no people thought it would take this long.”John Wilson, 68, said the Government was clueless on disentangling from the single market. “It has become a shambles,” he added.TOTNES MP Sarah Wollaston switched sides during the referendum campaign and became a Remainer.But she is out of step with her Devon constituency, where 53.9 per cent voted in favour of leaving the EU.Christine Williams, 64, said she was disappointed with Dr Wollaston.“I don’t know if I can now vote for her in the next election,” she added.Butcher Chris McCabe, 70, blamed Theresa May for the slow progress.He said: “This is like the Champions League final and we are at half-time.“She still has a chance but she needs to get her team in order so they can go back out and win this.”WHILE the capital was the heartland of Remain, in Bromley, South London, there was a paper-thin majority of 50.6 per cent in favour of staying in the EU. Tory MP Bob Neill is a Remainer.Gardener David Alden, 52, said: “It’s been dragged out for a reason. They know how to grind people down and tire them out. The elites want one thing and try any way to get it. They want to stop Brexit.”Retired software developer Steve Johnson, 58, said: “They are trying to come up with these fudges — ways to try to renege on the will of the people without outwardly doing so.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A Brexit that leaves it half in, half out and subject to EU rules it has no say over would be a disaster but that’s what seeking a deal at any price will lead to.As one of Britain’s many friends abroad, please accept my assurance that you don’t need a customs union to prosper.Without being in a customs union with Europe, and without any free trade deal with it, Australia does nearly $100billion a year in trade with Europe.In the two years of my prime minister-ship, Australia finalised free trade deals with our three biggest export markets: China, Japan and South Korea.So my advice to Britain is: Stop fretting! It IS possible to trade successfully under the WTO rules which already govern 55 per cent of Britain’s exports and it IS possible to do good deals with your main trading partners once you are free to do so, as Australia’s experience abundantly demonstrates.Let’s say, out of spite, the EU refuses to offer Britain a satisfactory bargain.Britain already imports goods from Europe free of tariffs and quotas. Britain already recognises European standards and credentials. Just declare that you will continue to do so.Trade from Europe to Britain would be absolutely free. And even if the Europeans — in an attempt to hurt Britain that would actually damage them — apply the same tariffs to Britain as they do to the US, the fall in the Pound would make British exports at least as competitive in Europe as they are now.Britain should still be the best place from which to export to Europe or to service Europe — because it has the freest markets, a can-do culture and will no longer have EU officials trying to harmonise away its competitive advantage.No new Brussels directives will apply in the UK. British courts will no longer be subject to European ones. And Britain need no longer admit everyone with an EU passport.Importantly, Britain will be able to strike trade deals with anyone it chooses without waiting for 27 other countries to sign up too.The coming Britain-Australia Free Trade Agreement should mean a dramatic increase in trade opportunities between our two countries without disadvantaging anyone else.First, there should be no tariffs or quotas on any goods traded between our two countries — there should be no exceptions, no carve outs, nothing. And second, there should be full recognition of each country’s credentials and standards.Because Australia and Britain are like-minded countries with similar systems and comparable standards of living, there should be no need for tortuous negotiation and labyrinthine detail.After all, Brit and Australian workers enjoy similar protections in the workplace: So why should they need elaborate protections against each other?Britain and Australia have comparable attitudes to job qualifications and product and service standards, so why should British rules be insufficient for Australia and vice versa?And Britons and Australians already have more than 200 years’ experience of each other, so why not allow them more freely to travel and work in each other’s country?This could be a template for the trade deals Britain could swiftly do with New Zealand and Singapore.On a similar basis, Britain could seek to join NAFTA, (North American Free Trade Agreement) which could become the North Atlantic Free Trade Area — and perhaps open to other free market economies seeking to escape the regulatory restraints and statism of the EU.Brexit could begin a process leading to genuinely freer global trade, rather than protectionist trade blocs.Brexit is a wonderful opportunity for Britain and the wider world — if only British leaders are prepared to make the most of it.So go for it Britain, for all our sakes!Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

An endless, choking diet of documentaries, live events, lectures, news items and outright bollockings, from the BBC, all to celebrate the 100th anniversary of women getting the vote.Not one of which had as much impact as Love Island’s “Girl Power” task on ITV2, involving super-hero capes, bikinis, large items of fruit and narrator Iain Stirling explaining: “The girls will squish melons with their bums. Slowest girl to crush her melon is out of the contest.”Just part of the reason I adore a show which pricks pomposity and political correctness like ­nothing else on British television and is dedicated to no other purpose than entertaining its viewers. That’s the ideal, anyway.The reality’s been a bit more disappointing, so far, probably due to the excessive hype and sense of deja vu with contestants on either half of the gender divide.Both operate a squad rotation system, of course, but among the main players on the blokes’ side, we have painfully shy ­doctor Alex, with all the presence of a fire extinguisher, Jack who “got his teeth in Turkey”, possibly by ripping them from a feral mountain goat’s mouth, and this year’s comedy figure Niall, who’s “an investment for the future”, a bit like Betamax video tapes, and “multi-layered”, like a landfill site.Click here to play our Love Island games - and win a £10,000 holiday for you and three friendsThere’s the compulsory personal trainer, as well, of course — Adam, who seems to have the run of the females, plus strong silent type Wes and fluffy-haired Eyal, pronounced “Eeeeh-al”, “Oooh-all”, or just “Aaaah-sole”, if you prefer.Quite the ­profound one, is Eyal, forever banging on about “auras” and his spirituality while insisting: “I want to find someone here with depth.”A claim which, surely, represents the very height of human optimism given the most profound question all of the girls were asking last week was: “Where’s your head at?”In Kendall’s case, it was “literally all over the place”. One of her eyes was in Majorca, another in Ibiza and her ­forehead was somewhere in the Cote d’Azur. She’s gone though now, leaving, among significant others: Samira, Georgia, Rosie, super- manipulative Hayley and Laura, a former air stewardess who’s ­covered in more make-up than the giraffe in a theatre ­production of The Lion King.Most of the hype, however, has centred around the ­presence of Dani Dyer, the daughter of EastEnders actor Danny Dyer. But you knew that already, didn’t you, possibly because you read it in the paper and possibly because you saw her perform exactly the same big reveal on ITV2’s Survival Of The Fittest a couple of months ago. A doubling up that blows my mind, frankly.Because you expect hit shows to be copied by other fringe channels.What you don’t expect is ITV2 to abuse the basic law of ­supply and demand by copying its own format. A move that doesn’t help Love Island at all. It stops it being an event, in fact, and just makes viewers think this sort of crap is on all year.Personally, I think that’s a shame. Love Island genuinely deserves to be a huge success again. Not only is it one of the funniest and most UN-PC shows on TV, it’s also a series that can actually make you feel glad to be old and half-crippled by your medical complaints, rather than the youthful insecurity and stupidity which has gripped this bunch, who really did surpass themselves, on Friday.Georgia: “What do you think of Brexit?”Hayley: “What’s that?”“We’re leaving the EU so things like welfare and, like, things we trade with would all be cut down.”“So that means we wouldn’t have any trees?”“Cheese?” “No, trees.” “Oh.”Emmeline Pankhurst, your work here on Earth was not in vain.(Love Island, ITV2, 9pm).HAVING discovered Danny Dyer is the rightful heir to the English throne, BBC1 really should’ve knocked it on the head with Who Do You Think You Are?Until such time as one of the researchers can prove Danniella Westbrook is the rightful heir to the Romanov dynasty and the Imperial Highness of all Russia.So they must have been flipping cartwheels at HQ when they discovered the great-great-grandmother of this week’s guest, ex-Corrie star Michelle Keegan had her birth certificate signed by registrar Emmeline Pankhurst, leader of the Suffragettes.A much greater honour, in the Beeb’s book, than three wise men and some shepherds turning up at your crib, but a detail that was probably as dull as ditch water for most viewers.The far more interesting thing to emerge during the hour, I thought, was Michelle’s own staggering ignorance of life, the world and everything.She had, for instance, no idea where Genoa was and gave a genuinely staggering response when a local historian told her: “By 1940 your family will have been torn apart, like every other family in Gibraltar, at the time.”“Why?”(Pause) “The Second World War.”You wondered then if the show would ever get round to revealing if the plank gene had entered her family tree through the maternal or paternal line.Then Michelle Skyped her mum and, waving a frothy cup of coffee at the screen, said: “Guess where I am. I’ll give you a clue, I’m drinking a cappuccino . . . ”“France?”Mystery solved.Loose Women, Russell Brand, with Janet Street-Porter: “Everyone is so beautiful here.”Good Morning Britain, roly-poly Piers Morgan: “When I grew up, I loved Frosties and it never did me any harm.”And Love Island, Samira: “I can sing, I can dance, I can act.” (Bursts into song).She can’t sing.NEVER, in all its ten-series history, has ITV’s love lift been quite as badly needed as it was on Saturday’s brilliant, one-off Take Me Out special for the “over-50s”.A slightly generous description, I thought, given the 30 game old birds looked like they had the combined age of the Pyramids.The fire still burns down below, though, evidently, as a queue of lights remained on for George, the midget Zumba teacher with the wooden teeth, Lawrence, the Billy Connolly lookalike from Ibiza, and even “bouncing Bill”, the ex-policeman, above, who emerged from Paddy McGuinness’s love lift gasping for breath and telling the women: “Every night, when I go to sleep, I like to think I’ve made someone’s life better. What would your motto be?”Fingers crossed, I’d imagine.Lee Dixon: “I like Alexander-Arnold because he gives you half a goal.”Ian Wright: “Harry Kane is still getting back to where he is.”And Glenn Hoddle: “By the time the World Cup starts, today will be history.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)Tipping Point, Ben Shephard: “In 1883 which luxury train service ran between Paris and the city now called Istanbul?” Alice: “The Eurostar.”Ben Shephard: “The former Labour MP Ed Balls married which politician in 1998?” Phil: “Theresa May.”The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “The plumage of what flightless bird was used as a medieval helmet decoration?” Geoff: “Eagle.”And Ben Shepherd: “How many of the eight planets in our solar system have the letter A in their name?”Harj: “I think the answer to that is one.

Without that ultimate weapon we are certain to get a poor deal.The Prime Minister cannot accept what a small handful of Remainers determined to stop Brexit are demanding.As she has rightly said, “No deal is better than a bad deal”.The people said leave, not leave when the EU gives us permission.The EU Withdrawal Bill, which MPs voted on this week, is about ensuring legal certainty at our point of departure.Jeremy Corbyn voted against the Government on this key bill, cynically trying to frustrate the Brexit process for his own political ends.If Conservatives do not demonstrate discipline in support of Theresa May on this, then we risk letting him into power.The Government has already said the EU Withdrawal Bill can be framed so as to give Parliament a vote on the final outcome, but without blocking the UK’s departure even without a deal.The Bill will go back to the House of Lords on Monday, and is likely then to return to the House of Commons.We need to get this out of the way, because it is 14 months on from triggering Article 50 and we still have not discussed the vital trade relationship between the UK and the EU.This is because the EU Commission deliberately set out to ensnare the UK in a tortuous bureaucratic process designed to leave us in the weakest position, bound to the EU as some sort of vassal state — as a rule-taker.In this, the EU has been emboldened by the appalling behaviour of the unelected House of Lords, which made it clear they want to reverse the result of the referendum. One peer even spoke arrogantly of now bringing the British people to heel.You only need to have watched as the EU’s negotiators have gratuitously and remorselessly set out not just to be difficult but, it has become clear, to humiliate us.For example, their refusal to agree to our continuing involvement in the Galileo satellite project, despite the fact that we have invested heavily in it, demonstrates how their behaviour has been calculated to offend.Even the UK’s offer of defence intelligence co-operation, which the EU needs, was brushed aside.That the EU is now strutting like the school bully should not surprise us, because of its ideological commitment to the European project at all costs.Yet, for all their bluster, this masks a weakness.The EU is deeply worried the UK will leave the EU and become a serious trade competitor, thus not only damaging the EU’s trading position but encouraging those in the EU who oppose this centralised, protectionist behemoth.We have reached a critical moment in the Brexit process. Because of the EU’s inflexibility, the Government has been forced to make concessions in the hope of discussing that all-important trade relationship.This has left many of us concerned that the process has been too one-sided.The UK has been behaving as a friend who wants an amicable divorce, while the EU has behaved like an opponent who wishes to impose their will and force the UK to repent what they believe is the folly of Brexit.That is why the UK needs now to change its negotiating stance, once the Brexit bill is passed.Too often it seems as though it is the UK which negotiates as a supplicant — despite the reality that, as the EU’s largest trade partner and the fifth largest economy in the world, with the world’s fourth most potent defence forces, the UK is deserving of much more respect from the EU.After all, there is a great deal at stake for the EU if these negotiations go wrong.There are many among the EU 27 who, like us, are growing weary of the EU’s arrogance. After all, it is many of them who stand to lose jobs if we fail to reach a trade arrangement.The EU Council meeting later this month has now become critical. It is there we should say that, notwithstanding any ongoing issues concerning the Irish border, our requirement is we move now to negotiate our post-Brexit trade relationship.If they refuse, and want instead to continue their border demands, then we must have the resolve to leave the table.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So far all I’ve come up with is Iggle Piggle, from TV’s In The Night Garden.I think negotiating Brexit would be a stretch for the friendly blue woollen creature with the red Mohawk.But maybe I’ve got him wrong, underestimated his abilities. He has a bell in his left foot. Theresa May seems to have a brain in her left foot. Given the choice, maybe I’d take the kid with the bell.We are in chaos. Not because we voted for Brexit, far from it. The economy is doing well. The sky has not fallen in. Investment up, employment hitting record levels, inflation down.No, the problem is solely a consequence of our Government. Right now we don’t know exactly what deals have been done with the rump of Remainers within the Conservative Party.One moment we’re told the Prime Minister has caved in to their demands. Next minute she hasn’t. Nobody knows quite what to believe.She is tip-toeing between the two sides solely to stay in power. And she has to be told: It isn’t working. It sends out a message to the people we are negotiating with that we haven’t a clue what’s going on.That policy is formulated on the hoof. In fact, it’s not policy at all, just inept fire-fighting. Inept because the flames are spreading — and as a result, our negotiating position becomes weaker by the hour.Some will argue May can only play the cards she has been dealt. That she has a minority Government and a split in her own party.Well, sure. But then, to a considerable degree, she dealt the cards herself. She called an election a year ago expecting to get a huge majority.I could have told her she would lose, if she’d asked. But she didn’t ask me, she asked some other numbnuts instead. This holy mess is of her making.Britain voted to leave the EU. Not to stay in bits of it. Not to remain constrained by the EU’s regulations. The Remainers don’t like that?Don’t care. You lost the argument — so shut up for a while. Or work to get us the best deal we can, outside the customs union.We need to be clear to the EU negotiators that we will happily take a no deal Brexit. They don’t want that — and a tough line will make them respond. If it doesn’t — fine, no deal is still much better than a bad deal.The EU is falling apart, largely for the reasons that convinced us to leave. Bullying, dictatorial, corrupt, undemocratic.We need a leader who can exploit their manifest weaknesses. A lot — perhaps a majority — of European people are on our side.That leader isn’t Theresa May. It needs to be someone within the Tories who is A. a Leave voter and B. has a bit of charisma and nous.I don’t really care who, right now, David Davis, Boris Johnson, Priti Patel, Michael Gove. But ABM — Anyone But May.It is not the EU that is hampering our exit strategy. It is our own Govern­ment. It’s time for Theresa to say: “That’s it: I’m out.”Now, quiz fans, here’s a question for you. What do Terry and Andraya possess that may have helped them come first and second?Jet-powered roller skates? Performance- enhancing drugs? Nope.They were both born with male bodies. And they both competed as boys until very recently.But according to the growing trend, they are now able to identify as girls without question. And so are allowed to compete against girls.And that’s what happens. They win because of biology.SHOULD the Royal Family be allowed to get their baps out? An important constitutional point.Meghan turned up for a royal engagement with her shoulders uncovered. And many people thought this was “inappropriate”. Only a matter of time before the female royals start trying to outdo each other.Kate in a glittery boob tube and Princess Anne in a leather basque with split-crotch undies.Bring it on.THE brilliant writer Lionel Shriver has been sacked as judge of a short story competition.This is because she objected to publishers having quotas that are supposed to “reflect diversity”.She said: “If an agent submits a manuscript written by a gay, ­trans- gender Caribbean who dropped out of school at seven and powers around town on a mobility scooter, it will be published.Whether or not . . . it is an incoherent, tedious, meandering and insensible pile of mixed- paper recycling.”The magazine that runs the competition sacked her for this.It said her comments were “not consistent” with its ethos.What it means is it disagrees with her.Freedom of speech, huh. Well done, Shriver.IN Cretins Corner this week are the libtards criticising President Trump for his attempts to make peace with North Korea.Six months ago these same people were screaming that Trump was leading us all to death and destruction by threatening Kim Jong-un.Now he’s accused of cosying up to a horrible dictator.Truth is, he’s played it brilliantly. Acting tough brought the porky dog-muncher to the negotiating table.And now we have at least a chance of peace in the world’s second most dangerous area (after the Middle East, natch).Barack Obama was bunged a Nobel Peace Prize for, essentially, doing nothing, by the liberals who run the awards.How about one for The Donald for actually achieving something?IS Sadiq Khan going mad?The Mayor of London has demanded that Wikipedia must “close the gender gap” on its entries. Just 17 per cent of biographies on Wiki are about women, apparently.What’s it got to do with you, you bumptious midget?As someone cleverly tweeted, just zero per cent of Imams at Britain’s mosques are female – perhaps they should close the gender gap a little too.Listen Sadiq, just build a few more homes in the capital and stop young ethnic minority people macheteing or machine gunning each other to death.When you’ve sorted that out, mate, then maybe you can start worrying about American online publications.Listen, mate. That’s our money you’re spending. He could have done that trip for sixty quid on the train.And we’d have thrown in a fiver for a packet of cashews and some Red Bull.APPARENTLY, young people are getting thicker.Their average IQ is declining year on year.If you follow the graph to its natural conclusion, by about 2028 they will have an IQ of zero.They’ll be like the Viz character Jellyhead, who had lime jelly between her ears and just lay on the floor all day.They’re already about the level of another Viz character, Terry F***witt.

The tide of rage at this global humiliation would destroy the Tories.The EU question would not be settled. It would be reignited with new ferocity. Ukip would be back with a vengeance.That all seems of scant concern to MPs who treat thwarting Brexit as a Westminster parlour game.Stay shackled to a customs union and single market rules? “Let’s just suck it up and move on,” says glib Remoaner Anna Soubry. Get that, Leavers? Anna and her friends will effectively negate your vote. Suck it up.They were elected on Tory and Labour manifestos committed to leaving in full, but will betray those too. Suck it up.Such is the contempt these MPs have for democracy when it delivers a result they don’t like.We do not know if Theresa May can stop them wrecking Brexit from here.And they seem neither to know nor care what they will unleash.THE alleged Chinese plot to steal defence secrets at Rolls-Royce exposes their grave threat to global security.Russia gets all the headlines. It is more thuggish and blatant, with its invasions, war crimes and chemical weapons.China is far bigger, richer, more ­powerful and more subtle.It is massively expanding its economic empire throughout the world — along with its military and a network of spies and cyber-warriors dedicated to filching state secrets and intellectual property.We should have no desire to make enemies of China. Indeed, if we are ever able to strike our own trade deals post-Brexit, it should be among the first.But we must be alive to its dangers, and punish harshly those caught betraying us.WHAT a summer of passion, drama and potential heartbreak it’s going to be — we’ll be glued to every second.No, not Love Island.

Your actions are reprehensible and have no place in Labour.At a separate meeting last month, Nicaraguan officials met with senior union bosses and Labour staffers, including one aide to Diane Abbott.Attempts to whitewash the regime are being led by the Nicaragua Solidarity Campaign - which blames the violence on right-wing forces.The campaign is based in the same building in North London as Mr Corbyns constituency office.And its affiliated to branches of most major trade unions - including Labours main bankrollers Unite.The Nicaraguan governments case is also being spread in Britain by far-left media such as the Morning Star - where Mr Corbyn used to write a column - and notorious conspiracy website The Canary.At least 150 people, mostly protesters taking part in student-led demos, have died since violence broke out in April.Amnesty International says Ortegas regime is deploying paramilitary fighters with a shoot to kill policy.The country is now in a state of chaos, as opposition forces push for the president - who has appointed his wife as vice-president - to stand down.Former foreign minister Francisco Aguirre-Sacasa has accused Ortega of systematically dismantling Nicaragua’s fragile democracy.Mr Corbyn was a firm supporter of Ortegas rule when the president had his first term of office in the 1980s.And 18 months ago he was seen singing Nicaraguan revolutionary songs at a union Christmas party.But recently Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry called for the Government to confront Ortega over the violence.A spokesman for the Labour boss refused to comment, and Chris Williamson did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT0004114326991.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"dominic grieve anna soubry brexit ransom","story":"We’re delighted No10 refused to buckle to these diehard Remainers ­yesterday.

Wilko has a fantastic range of presents perfect for green-fingered dads. And best of all, they won\u0027t break the bank as all come in at under \u0026pound15 each. As well as picking our favourite half dozen, we\u0027ve also detailed how to use each item to its full potential to help your dad transform his garden with ease.  They include everything from beds and pots to award-winning gadgets - now all you have to worry about is getting him a card! 1 - Wilko garden tool handle, \u0026pound4  This amazing gadget is so groundbreaking (excuse the pun) that it actually won a 2017 Red Dot award for design and innovation. It attaches to long-handled gardening tools such as rakes or garden brushes to add an extra handle, making it easier to manoeuver the devices. No wonder the judges praised it as a ‘simple and innovative solution’ to an age-old gardening problem. 2 - Wilko angled raised bed, \u0026pound12    Whether you want to try your hand at creating a vegetable, herb or salad garden, or just add additional flowering space in a small area, wilko’s angled raised bed could be the answer. It’s perfect for those with back and knee problems, eliminating cumbersome crawls on the ground. Whatever your gardening issue, this hack’s got it covered. 3 - Wilko drainpipe pot holders in black, green and aubergine, \u0026pound2.50  Whether you’re trying to turn a tiny back yard into a stunning green garden, or prettify a drab space, these clever drainpipe pot holders can help you do it. The holder attaches to most round drainpipes (68mm), so all you need to add is a matching plant pot (sold separately) and you’re good to grow. With a choice of black, green and aubergine colours to choose from, and no hooks, drills or holes required, this could quite possibly be the easiest way to brighten up your outdoor space. 4 - Wilko hanging plant pots in black, green and aubergine, \u0026pound5  Bring on the Hanging Gardens of Babylon with this innovative solution to creating gardens in limited spaces. Easily attached to most fences and balconies (fits up to 50mm panels), the small reservoir in the bottom of these hanging pots also keeps plants hydrated for longer by providing a water source whenever it’s needed, so you won’t have to water as often. Available in black, green and aubergine, fill with your favourite plants and watch your garden bloom. 5 - Wilko terracotta patio plant pot Camper Bella Misto 25cm, \u0026pound3.50  These pretty pots don’t just look good – they’re actually live savers when it comes to plants. The porous nature of terracotta allows air and water to pass through the walls of the pot, allowing plants to thrive by staving off diseases caused by overwatering. These containers are frost resistant too, adding extra protection during cold spells. As far as we’re concerned, it’s the niftiest plant-saving device on the market. 6 - Wilko PVC cloche greenhouse with two openings, H60 x W120 x D60cm, \u0026pound10  If spring frosts kill off your attempts to grow flowers before they even get off the ground, this frost-resistant mini-greenhouse could be the answer. It offers everything a traditional greenhouse does, just on a smaller scale. So think seed propagation, insect protection, and a bright, warm environment in which plants can grow before graduating to outdoors. All at a fraction of the price (and size) of classic versions.

The spending watchdog found it has not delivered value for money, its rollout has been slower and costlier than promised, and it\u0027s caused hardship for many people. It\u0027s a devastating blow to the six-in-one benefit that was announced in 2010 as the pet project of former Tory welfare chief Iain Duncan Smith. It has since been taken over by a string of Work and Pension Secretaries and now rests in the hands of Tory Esther McVey. Labour MP Frank Field, who chairs the Work and Pensions Select Committee, today brands the benefit a “shambles, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake”. And campaigners have used the report to call for reform of the benefit, which has already cost the state \u0026pound1.9bn to date.  Here are 5 of the most devastating findings in the report.  Last year along a quarter of new claims were not paid in full on time - a total of 113,000. And from January to October 2017, 40% of those affected by late payments waited for 11 weeks or more. A fifth of those with late payments waited almost five months. But despite improvements, in March this year 21% of new claimants did not receive their full entitlement on time with 13% receiving no payment on time. The DWP does not anticipate that delays will improve this year, the NAO said. And the DWP believes it will never achieve 100% payment on time because of the need to verify claimants\u0027 eligibility, the NAO warned. 2. It\u0027s taking far, far longer than expected  It\u0027s hard to believe it now, but Universal Credit was originally due to be rolled out fully by October 2017. Yet eight years after it was announced, only around 10% of the final expected caseload are currently claiming Universal Credit. There have been a string of delays and it\u0027s now due to end by March 2022. 3. It\u0027s could cost even more than the old system  The NAO said the system\u0027s running costs are currently \u0026pound699 per claim - against an ambition of \u0026pound173 by 2024. And it warned UC may cost more to administer than the system it replaced, which included job seeker\u0027s allowance, tax credit and housing benefit. Universal Credit has not delivered value for money and it is uncertain that it ever will, the NAO said. The project is not value for money now, and that its future value for money is unproven. 4. Its entire selling point could be an empty promise  Universal Credit was sold to the nation on the basis it will encourage people into work. That\u0027s because it is designed to make work pay by ensuring people aren\u0027t accidentally penalised for every extra hour they work.  However, the NAO said we doubt it will ever be possible for the DWP to measure if Universal Credit has increased the number of people in work. 5. It drives people to food banks - and the DWP\u0027s in denial  Since the introduction of UC there have been increases in rent arrears and the use of food banks, the NAO reported. The watchdog added private landlords have become reluctant to rent homes to people on the flahship benefit. In three of the four areas the NAO visited that had proper data, foodbank use increased quicker after Universal Credit was rolled out fully. But the report warned the DWP does not accept that Universal Credit has caused hardship among claimants. The Department has not shown sufficient sensitivity towards some claimants, the NAO said. It does not know how many claimants are having problems with the programme or have suffered hardship. Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, warned the DWP has shown a lack of regard in failing to understand the hardship faced by some claimants. But we\u0027re so far down the track, there\u0027s no way it can stop  NAO chief Amyas Morse added: The benefits that it set out to achieve through Universal Credit, such as increased employment and lower administration costs, are unlikely to be achieved. Yet the Department has little realistic alternative but to continue with the programme and hopefully learn from past mistakes.”   How have campaigners reacted?

One of the pair is severely diabetic and has to be watched at night to avoid slipping into a deadly coma. The pair\u0027s lawyers argued that this need for an observer counted as therapy - which would, in turn, give the claimant higher PIP.

MPs cried shame as progress of the bill, which has cross-party support and is backed by the Government, was delayed until at July because of the antics of Shipley MP Philip Davies and Christchurch MP Sir Christopher Chope. The pair have frequently taken advantage of an archaic quirk of Commons rules in which MPs are prevented from voting on a bill on a Friday if the debate goes on past 2.30pm. There is no time limit on members\u0027 speeches on a Friday, effectively allowing them to talk for as long as they want. Their marathon speeches were during the first debate of the day, on a bill to tighten regulation on the use of force in Mental Health Units.  Davies addressed more than 100 amendments put to the Mental Health Units (Use of Force Bill) at report stage by MPs, including several of his own, during an address which lasted almost two-and-a-half hours. The Shipley MP clashed frequently with his frontbench over the need for some of his amendments, at one stage branding ministers shameful after being told one was unnecessary. Other MPs also voiced their frustration at the length of his speech, which finished after 148 minutes. As his speech hit the two-hour mark, Liberal Democrat former health minister Norman Lamb said: I have a very real concern - and I don\u0027t think it\u0027s his intention, but I hope it isn\u0027t - that we could end up this being talked out today, and the risk then that this Bill is lost. That would be a tragedy if that happened.  Mr Davies insisted the Bill would not be lost, and would progress on a future Friday sitting in a better state once the Government has looked at amendments. Mr Davies pushed two of his amendments to a vote, both linked to training in appropriate use of force. Amendment 11 was defeated by 47 votes to eight, majority 39, and amendment 12 was defeated by 49 votes to three, majority 46. The Bill later progressed to third reading, the final Commons stage, where it was talked out by Conservative former minister Sir Christopher Chope.  The Christchurch MP was still speaking as the clock struck 2.30pm, meaning it had not formally completed the stage as debate was still considered to be ongoing. It will return to the Commons on July 6, where third reading debate will resume. After the 2.30pm deadline, there is an opportunity for bills to be waved through the initial debate stage without a vote - as long as nobody in the chamber voices an objection. Every bill on today\u0027s order paper was either not moved, or blocked by an objection and delayed until July 6th - when they will be sent to the bottom of the list of bills to be debated. He is an absolute pr**k: Reaction to the bill being blocked In a statement, campaigner Gina Martin said: I am obviously extremely upset and disappointed that Sir (Christopher) Chope decided to object on this vitally important bill for the women of England and Wales. I remain positive, though. We knew this was a risk - but I now stand with powerful, passionate women and men behind me, and I am confident that (junior minister) Lucy Frazer is committed to - and will - close this gap in the law.  Ryan (Whelan, her lawyer), Wera (Hobhouse MP) and I will be meeting with Lucy shortly to discuss how we move forward together. Ryan and I have just spoken with Sir Christopher and he has agreed to meet with the two of us to discuss the bill.  I\u0027m positive and hopeful that he will become a supporter.

Here are some of the key questions surrounding the issue: What is upskirting? The cruel and invasive craze involves perpetrators using cameras to take images or video up victims\u0027 clothing without their consent to see their genitals or underwear.. While the vast majority of known cases involve men targeting women, the roles sometimes can be reversed. The first available data on the prevalence of upskirting showed victims as young as 10 complaining to police. Currently, there is no specific law in place banning the practice. But haven\u0027t people been convicted of upskirting? While Scotland has had its own law on upskirting for almost a decade, the law in England and Wales has not adapted to advances in technology. Currently, anyone in England and Wales who falls victim to the cruel craze can explore possible convictions for public disorder or indecency. Campaigners want a specific offence. Why could campaigner Gina Martin not prosecute at the time?  Her lawyer, Ryan Whelan, said: Decisions to prosecute rest with the authorities, not the victim. Under the current law the man who upskirted Gina could have potentially been prosecuted for outraging public decency. The problem is that prosecuting upskirters for outraging public decency is not appropriate. There are two primary reasons for this. First the offence of outraging public decency does not apply in all instances of upskirting. This means that women are not protected in all circumstances. Second, the offence of outraging public decency is inappropriate as it fails to reflect the sexual nature of the offence and/or the fact that the harm is caused to the individual (rather than the public). These positions are not controversial. Leading authorities in the field agree with my client: upskirting is a gap in the law and the only way to solve it is by legislation. What would the new law say? The new law would bring the punishment for upskirting in line with other existing voyeurism offences, and the changes will see offenders face a maximum of two years in prison. It would also allow this intrusive behaviour to be treated as a sexual offence and, with Government amendments, ensure that the most serious offenders are made subject to notification requirements - commonly referred to as the sex offenders register. There will be a threshold, meaning those who commit the more serious offences - especially those designed to cause alarm, distress or humiliation - are dealt with more seriously. Who is backing it?  The Government stated its support for making upskirting a specific criminal offence hours before Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse\u0027s Private Members\u0027 Bill. It was the crucial backing campaigners - including upskirting victim Gina Martin, 26, and her legion of famous supporters - were hoping for after months of meetings with the Ministry of Justice to thrash out terms for suitable legislation. High-profile public figures - such as television presenters Holly Willoughby, Dermot O\u0027Leary and Laura Whitmore - have also been open about their support for the campaign. How was it blocked?

According to single mum Krysta, 29, her 10-year-old daughter Shyyra would often come home and talk about Jessie, her favourite teacher, who she nicknamed Mr Thor because of his long blonde hair.  Over the space of a year, the two adults would speak intermittently when Krysta came to drop off and pick her daughter up, reports .   However Jessie was sure he felt a connection between them, so eventually worked up the nerve to ask her out on a coffee date in October 2015. The pair immediately hit it off, talking for hours.

He was going to take Krysta on a romantic walk and have Shyyra surprise her with a ring - but when the time came, Shyyra got her own special surprise. The former teacher, who now works as a landscaping manager, got down on one knee and had prepared proposals for both of the ladies in his life. He said: I got down on one knee, held out a necklace I had bought Shyyra and said, \u0027I love you with all my heart and I have two questions.\u0027  The first one was \u0027Do I have permission to be your dad?\u0027 and the second was \u0027Can I have permission to marry your mom?\u0027 She said yes and then she hugged me.

After all, what do you even get the woman who already has everything, bar a unicorn or the elixir of life? But this doesn\u0027t mean that the rest of the family get novelty toilet seats and whoopee cushions.  Take the Duchess of Cambridge for example.  Since joining the royal ranks, she\u0027s been showered with the sort of lavish gifts the rest of us can only ever dream of.  Let\u0027s take a look and see what the best ones have been.   1. The Cartier Ballon Bleu watch  Traditionally, your third wedding anniversary symbol used to be leather. Then it got updated to glass or crystal. Not if you\u0027re royal though. For her third wedding anniversary in 2014, Kate got the Ballon Bleu de Cartier watch.  Set with tiny sapphires, it matches her engagement ring - also another high-rent gift - and also has echoes of Princess Diana, who loved Cartier watches.    2. Her engagement ring Arguably her first bit of regal bling, Kate\u0027s engagement ring is now believed to be priceless, due to its historical significance. Once belonging to Princess Diana, it\u0027s made up of a band featuring a 12-carat sapphire surrounded by 14 diamonds and set in 18-carat white gold, and spawned countless imitations.  3. Anmer Hall from the Queen This one will put every gift you\u0027ve ever received in the shade. As the ultimate wedding present, the Queen gave Kate and William their very own stately home. No scrimping and saving to get on the property ladder for this couple. Set on the Queen\u0027s Sandringham estate, Anmer Hall boasts ten bedrooms, a swimming pool and private tennis court and was recently refurbished to the tune of several millions of pounds.  4. A white and yellow diamond jewellery set from Prince Charles Proving she\u0027s very much in there with her in-laws, Kate received a set of art deco diamond jewellery as a wedding gift in 2011 from Prince Charles. It features a white and yellow diamond bracelet, earrings and ring, all of which Kate has been seen in on several occasions. 5. A charm bracelet from the Duchess of Cornwall Lucky Kate must need a vault for all of her baubles. As another wedding gift - this time from the Duchess of Cornwall - Kate received a gold link charm bracelet with some very sweet details. It features a gold disc engraved with a C for Catherine and a coronet on one side, and a crown and C for Camilla on the other.    6. Sapphire and diamond earrings from Prince William We know they married for love, but Kate\u0027s wedding proved to be pretty lucrative for her! Around the time of their nuptials in 2011, William gave Kate a pair of matching sapphire and diamond earrings, which she then customised into drop earrings and debuted them on her tour of Canada.  7. Green amethyst earrings from William Clearly a generous spouse, for their first Christmas as a married couple, William gifted Kate a pair of green amethyst earrings from one of her favourite designers, Kiki McDonough. The earrings are surrounded by diamonds and set in 18-carat yellow gold, and Kate wore them for the first time for the church service on Christmas Day in 2011.

The youngster was upset when her mum and dad said she had to go to bed rather than catch up on the hit ITV2 reality show. Her parents were so concerned they dialled 999 and told stunned call-handlers they feared for their safety. Leicestershire Police classed the call as a ‘Grade One’ emergency and sent officers with lights flashing and sirens blaring. They spoke to the family at their home in Coalville, Leics, on Wednesday night and left without making any arrests.  A statement from Market Bosworth Police on Facebook said: “An 11-year-old girl kicked off because she wasn’t allowed to watch Love Island. “Due to the information passed by the caller, this was risk assessed and graded as a ‘Grade One’ - which means they attended as an emergency on blues and twos. True story.” The girl’s parents were slammed by Facebook users for resorting to using the 999 emergency service.  Hanna Williams wrote: “Hope all involved got a good talking to for wasting time - as well as even contemplating watching Love Island.” Michael Feliciant said: “What has happened to parenting? It’s bad enough to argue with your children about TV programmes but to call the police? “This is the rubbish on TV that has got control of some of the public.

Summer Grant passed away in hospital after she was rescued from the inflatable at an Easter Fair in Harlow, Essex, on March 26, 2016. Husband and wife fairground workers William and Shelby Thurston were handed a sentence of three years each today.  Summer\u0027s mum Cara Blackie has told Chelmsford Crown Court today how she screamed when a nurse phoned her while she was in a taxi to tell her that her daughter had died. In a heartbreaking statement, she said: I never thought that my Summer playing and having fun on the bouncy castle would end her young life. Outside court, police read out a statement by Cara which said: The feeling I had leaving Summer in hospital alone will be with me forever.  Her dad Lee Grant\u0027s devastating statement in court said: When Summer died, I felt as if I died too. I felt as if I had nothing left to live for because she was my beautiful angel. DCI Daniel Stoten later read a further comment from Lee which said: I just want to cry and cry and for someone to tell me that this is a really long and horrible dream. But it is not, it is very real and it hurts so much. A court heard how the day after her death, younger sister Lily was told that Summer was up in the sky with the angels.  Her mum lay with her in bed and tried to explain what had happened but \u0027didn\u0027t understand what she was saying\u0027.  That night, her mother saw her staring out the window in their hotel room. She said: “I’m saying goodnight to Summer.” Cara said: It was killing me inside, but I knew I had to be strong for her sake.  During sentencing remarks, a court was told: It does not bear thinking about what that little girl went through inside that bouncy castle. A trial previously heard the inflatable rolled up to 15 times in the air after it came off the ground. It was said to have blown 15ft in the air and landed 300m away.  William and Shelby Thurston had denied manslaughter by gross negligence and a health and safety offence at a previous hearing at Chelmsford Crown Court.  But after a three-week trial a jury found them both guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence last month. The couple, from Wilburton, near Ely, Cambridgeshire, were also found guilty of failure to discharge a duty under section 3 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. During the sentencing remarks today, a judge told the Thurstons they had put children at real risk of harm. The judge added that it was only good fortune that Summer\u0027s sister Lily was not also inside the bouncy castle, Essex Live reports.   Her mum Cara\u0027s statement in court today said: I was home watching a film when my phone rang. It was Tasha Stephens and she was crying and not making much sense. I could not make sense what was going on. My heart sank. I just wanted to be there for my little girl. We called a taxi to take us to Harlow. All sorts of things were going through my head but not that my daughter would die. After being in the taxi for 15 minutes a nurse called and told me Summer had died. I screamed. Cara described how before Summer\u0027s funeral, she painted her daughter\u0027s nails blue - her favourite colour. She also put her glittery shoes in the coffin - the ones that Summer wanted to wear on her first night out. The court heard that since Summer\u0027s death, Cara has suffered from anxiety and depression which has made everyday life very hard.  The schoolgirl, from Norwich, had been at the fair with her father Lee and other family members. We all have to live with this for the rest of our lives,” a statement on behalf of Lee read out in the courtroom today said. Lee described as Summer as the most beautiful and polite little girl you could ever know who was loved by everyone she met.  She did not deserve what happened, and this should never happen again to anyone, a statement by Lee read out by police outside court said.  Family members of the Thurstons burst into tears as the sentences were passed. In the sentencing remarks, the fairground workers were told: This was not simple negligence. This was gross negligence. Your breaches of duty were not just serious mistakes. Your conduct was so bad that in the jury’s view, it must be regarded as criminal. At the heart was your failure to have any sensible regard for the weather. High winds had been predicted for days. You knew that or should have known that. You were putting your customers, and by customers I mean children like Summer and Lily, at real risk of harm.”  The judge said the fairground workers had failed to ensure the dome was adequately anchored to the ground and to monitor the weather conditions to ensure they were suitable.  They were told: You were both directly responsible for this. You failed to ensure that the dome was properly secured to the ground. The evidence as to the number of anchorage points out of the available 17 that were in fact used is somewhat opaque. That being so, I cannot conclude that you failed to use all 17 and I proceed on the basis you did. But you did not use the upper four anchorage points with which the dome was fitted.  I find as a fact that that is what those tags were for and I find that you were in breach of your duty under the Health and Safety at Work Act in not doing so. The judge paid tribute to the dignity shown by Summer\u0027s family during the trial.  Shortly before 4.15pm the East of England Ambulance service had received a call and they attended with commendable speed, the court heard.  Summer was taken to the Princess Alexandra Hospital by ambulance where tragically, she died from multiple injuries she sustained as the dome careered down the hill.  Dad Lee had run after the inflatable, which was lifted off the ground by wind while Summer was playing on it, jurors have previously been told. Ms Ayling earlier told the court that Mr Grant ran after the SuperDome as it lifted into the air. The prosecution lawyer said: “Lee Grant heard his mother scream ‘No!’. He turned and saw the dome inflatable had lifted into the air, appeared to hit a caravan before flipping over. “He shouted: ‘My daughter is in that’, and ran after it, but it was moving to fast for him to catch it. “Another woman who was at pet’s corner could see the top of the SuperDome as it was lifting in the air. “It was cartwheeling and only stopped when it crashed into a fence at the bottom of the park.” Summer suffered serious injuries during the incident and died just a few hours later. Speaking after the guilty verdicts, Nicola Rutter from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said: William and Shelby Thurston failed to ensure that the bouncy castle was adequately anchored to the ground and failed to monitor the weather conditions to ensure that it was safe to have it in use. They denied their actions were negligent but the CPS and the police built a strong case, together with assistance from the Health and Safety Executive, and demonstrated to the jury that the Thurstons had breached their duty of care to Summer. Our thoughts are with Summer\u0027s family and friends.

The former Suits actress, now the Duchess of Sussex, has to follow strict dietary rules following her wedding to Prince Harry last month. Royal Butler Grant Harrold has revealed the royal family do not eat seafood out of fear of getting food poisoning.  He told the Express : “It is a very sensible move to abandon having seafood when out and about on public duties.  “We don\u0027t want a member of the Royal family having a serious reaction to food poisoning, especially if she is on an overseas tour.”  No doubt Meghan was disappointed by this restriction in her diet as she has previously spoken about her love of seafood. The 36-year-old told The New Potato magazine that her ideal food day would involve lots of seafood. She said: “A leisurely dinner of seafood and pasta, and a negroni to cap off the night.” However, seafood isn\u0027t in the only restriction as other luxurious dishes are also banned.  Mr Harrold added: “As well as shellfish, it would also be quite appropriate for foods such as foie gras to be avoided.”  Andrew Farquharson, Deputy Master at Clarence House, also told the  : “The Prince of Wales has a policy that his chefs should not buy foie gras.”  This is believed to be due to animal welfare concerns rather than a dietary restriction. Other rules Meghan now has to follow include not being allowed to vote, no selfies, no autographs and she must always travel with a black outfit in case a member of the royal family dies.  Meghan is still getting used to royal protocol and yesterday she had to ask the Queen for advice during their first engagement together in Cheshire.

Laura Ashton, 22, was getting ready for the school-run with daughters Millie, five, and Gracie-May, one, when she says she made the shocking discovery. Noticing her toddler needed changing, the mum-of-two rushed into the living room and picked up the next nappy out of the \u0026pound4.98 Asda Little Angels 72-pack. But the support worker from Stafford, Staffordshire, explained how she noticed a small dark mark underneath the topsheet of the disposable nappy. Tearing the nappy open Laura was shocked to pull out a sharp, mysterious object.  She has since called on safer regulations to be put in place in the manufacturing process of babies’ nappies. “I had just finished getting Millie’s bag ready for school before I realised Gracie-May needed changing, she said. “I walked into the living room and picked out the next nappy from the pack. “As I opened it up I noticed something dark in the middle so rubbed my fingers across it.  “It felt quite pointy so I told Millie to film me opening it up. “After a few seconds I managed to tear out a sharp, dark object. It felt quite light but it was really sharp. “At first I thought it was a piece of machinery but God knows what it was. “Millie was shouting ‘chuck it in the fire’. We then started going through a few more to see if anything else dangerous was lurking in there. “I’m just so shocked. If I hadn’t spotted it that could have pierced through and really hurt Gracie-May.” Laura contacted Asda after finding the object on Monday morning. “I phoned up customer services to make a complaint and they just told me to go back to my local store”, she said. “I marched down there and was just handed another 72-pack of nappies. As if I’m going to use them! “It’s outrageous. I’ll never buy them again.” Laura shared her terrifying discovery on Facebook, clocking up 430,000 views and 6,000 shares.  She said: “I did it to raise awareness among my family and friends as I was just outraged with what had happened. “You just don’t know how many times this has happened and people have let it slide.

Go on take your last ounce of respect and do it somewhere else. Spice is usually a mix of herbs or shredded plant material with man-made mind-altering chemicals sprayed on to them. It is marketed as an alternative to cannabis by drug dealers but, chemically, the two drugs are very different. Cannabis comes from a plant, but Spice is a “synthetic cannabinoid”, a family of around 700 research chemicals. Although it is sold to look like cannabis, the effects come from the chemicals.  Because there are over 700 types, any of which can be used to create Spice, the effects of the drug can vary massively depending on which compounds have been used in its production. Only last month, Logan Johns-Evans, 11, was left like a zombie after it was claimed that a rolly cigarette he had been smoking was laced with the synthetic drug without his knowledge. Spice used to be available in shops and online and was sold as a so-called legal-high, but it was made illegal in 2016 under the Psychoactive Substances Act. South Wales Police have said: We are aware of a photo circulating on social media which appears to show a small number of men in Bridgend Town Centre experiencing the devastating effects that alcohol or drugs can have upon individuals.

finished in 12th spot last season.Also in the frame are Hibs after manager Neil Lennon admitted he was keen on Crawford, while Motherwell have also made advances.The attacking midfielder certainly has options to choose from for his next destination but has indicated he will take his time over the decision.Meanwhile, Dundee’s pursuit of Peterborough defender Jack Baldwin has recieved a boost.The Posh have snapped up Ross County defender Jason Naismith.The Staggies full-back impressed last season despite the Highland side finishing bottom of the Premiership pile and suffering relegation as a result.And Steve Evans has swooped for another Scotsman after grabbing Dee midfielder Mark O’Hara at the end of last month on a free transfer.Signing Naismith has seen Dundee target Baldwin transfer listed at London Road with his services no longer required.The asking price of £200,000, however, is still in place which could put an end to the Dark Blues’ interest.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/apprentice-paul-e1528799216800-503x564.jpg ","title":"dundee people apprentice takes silver in national

Instead it is being used against us, for doing something that every licence holder is trained to do.“These premises have been run by someone with 29 years of experience, four years of which at the Balcony Bar, and she has taken steps to ensure these issues do not reoccur.”Licensing board convener Stewart Hunter chose to defer a decision on whether to impose sanctions.However, he warned: “If there are still issues police will have the power to take action as required at a later stage.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/794603-806x564.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds 25 mile rule worked for kids under jim mclean but might prove difficult attracting experienced pros","story":"\t\t\t\t\tWhen Dundee United chairman Mike Martin last week announced the club would restore a historic rule from Jim McLean’s era, it sparked a host of memories for former defender Jackie Copland.\u0026nbspThe ex-Terror, who played for the Tannadice club from 1970-76, was a defensive stalwart under McLean – who brought him to the club from Stranraer after a spell in the juniors with Beith.As a young player, Jackie was subject to McLean’s rule that players must reside in the Tayside area while playing for the club.Something not dissimilar to Martin’s vision of Csaba Laszlo’s squad living within a 25-mile radius of the city.Jackie, who started and finished his football career at boyhood heroes St Mirren, admits the move will have pros and cons for United.“When I first moved up to Dundee it was a rule that you had to stay within the local area,” he said.“The club had a hostel in Broughty Ferry for young players, the likes of Walter Smith stayed there.“He would stay there during the week and travel home to the west at the weekend, like a lot of boys did.“I think it was beneficial as it gave the manager a chance to assess the young players.“It was fine at first but when I became a senior player I wasn’t happy with it.“I spoke to Jim McLean and, eventually, made an agreement that I would travel up with Andy Gray from Glasgow every day.“Trying to get senior players to come through might, obviously, become an issue. However, a few guys like Alan Gordon would travel through from Edinburgh.“It may be difficult, now, to get experienced players to relocate with the commitments they have like young kids and houses – that could cause an issue for Csaba.“That’s before you even get to the problem of fighting other teams financially.”Jackie left the club to re-join the Buddies for a successful period in their history from 1976-1983 before moving into various administration roles at the club.Of the move back, Jackie added: “Initially it worked at United but then it became a bit difficult.“The manager understood that and he was really good about it before I moved to St Mirren.“I always lived locally and followed the team so it felt right to move back at that time.“It’s funny how you get an association with a club and have an affinity with it.“I enjoyed my time at Tannadice as much as I did my spell at St Mirren.“Obviously, I finished my career at St Mirren and became a bit of a club legend but I still miss the Dundee days. I’m coming up in November for a reunion with the 1973/74 Scottish Cup Final team so it will be nice to catch up with everyone.”Of his former sides’ recent history, Jackie has watched United flounder from afar as St Mirren won promotion to the Premiership last season under the now-Sunderland boss Jack Ross.“Dundee United is a great club and I hope it can be restored in the top league because the fans deserve it.“St Mirren were going good.

Their presence should help the hosts get through to the next stage.The Saudis, while a decent side, will do well to avoid defeat in all three of their games.Star player: Salem Al-Dawsari.Local link: Back in 1989, Saudi Arabia were based at Dens Park for the group stage of the U/15 World Cup. They went on to win the tournament by beating Scotland in the final at Hampden – amid, it should be said, accusations of them fielding over-age players.EgyptThey could be the surprise packages of Group A, though with Liverpool’s Mo Salah battling for fitness after dislocating a shoulder in the Champions League Final, goals could be a problem.With the likes of Mohamed Elneny of Arsenal and Aston Villa’s Ahmed Elmohamady in their line-up, they are not quite a one-man team.Star player: Mo Salah.Local link: United legend Maurice Malpas made remarkable comeback from a serious knee injury to face the Egyptians in a 3-1 Pittodrie defeat for Scotland as they warmed up for the 1990 World Cup.And Dundee goalie Elliott Parish played for England in an U/20s World Cup in Egypt back in 2009.UruguayTwice winners of the World Cup, a third triumph is highly unlikely, but the Uruguayans are a side most of the big guns would like to avoid.With Barcelona striker Luis Suarez in their ranks they will always carry a big goal threat, though having finished the last two World Cups in disgrace, just getting through these finals without mishap might be his biggest achievement.Star player: Luis Suarez.Local link: Dundee United have signed three Uruguayans, though between them Juan Ferreri, Carlos Marcora and Edison Machin managed just two appearances.One-time national team skipper Machin did look quality but passport problems led to his stay being a brief one.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/dundee2-257x180.jpg ","title":"the teles world cup preview group bs local links","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYet again Scotland aren\u0026#8217t there but all eyes are now firmly fixed on the World Cup in Russia after yesterday\u0026#8217s big kick-off.The action got under way in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium with a bang as the hosts smashed Saudi Arabia 5-0.Today sees Egypt take on Uruguay in Group A as well as Group B kicking off.Now, the Tele takes it\u0026#8217s own special preview of Group B with Morocco, Iran battling it out with giants Portugal and Spain.Trying not to leave you feeling too left out by the Tartan Army’s absence, we’ll also provide a local link, tenuous or otherwise, to each participating nation.\u0026nbspGroup BMoroccoThe Moroccans will want to put up a good showing in Russia after the disappointment of missing out in their bid to host the 2026 World Cup.It’s their first appearance in the finals since France 98 – more of that below – and they boast enough players playing at a decent level in the European leagues to be able to give a good account of themselves.Star player: Medhi Benatia.Local link: Although he was born in St Tropez in the south of France, Dundee striker Faissal El Bakhtaoui also qualifies for Morocco through family links.More painfully, Dundonian and former Dundee United favourite Christian Dailly was part of the side that lost 3-0 to Morocco in 1998 – Scotland’s last game in a finals.\u0026nbspIranThey’ll be regarded by many as among the minnows of these finals but Iran actually head for Russia boasting a Fifa ranking of 36.That’s just two behind Scotland.Star player: Ashkan Dejagah.Local link: Danny McLennan.If the name on its own doesn’t bring it all flooding back, we can reveal the man who briefly joined Dundee from East Fife in 1957 and played in four League Cup ties before disappearing again, went on to manage Iran for a year between 1973 and 1974.

Funds raised in memory of local schoolboy Hamish Hey (8) will contribute to the process of shaping the links.The Team Hamish charity, established in memory of the young cancer victim, has raised more than \u0026pound50,000. Relatives want residents to share their thoughts at the charity\u0027 own consultation event next Wednesday (7.30-9pm) in the town\u0027 community and arts centre.It is working with the council and the Nairn Improvement Community Enterprise to create a disabled-friendly links recreation area.The council wants to promote use of the links to \"build on the special nature of the area and add to the historic value of the links as a visitor destination\".Consultation already carried out showed strong support for replacing the paddling pool with \"an alternative form of water play\". People want it open more often and to accommodate all age groups. It could be based on water fountains/jets, as in an installation in Southend which includes colour changing lighting.Another option is to create a three-storey adjacent lido with open-air pool on the top floor and spa facilities on the first floor.A further option is to take over the nearby council-owned Nairn Leisure Centre pool, give it a glass roof and create a training and competition facility to complement a lido.The lido proposal was inspired by Bath\u0027 dramatic Thermae Spa.Lessees of the neighbouring links tearoom and James\u0026rsquo Caf\u0026eacute have put forward proposals to improve their facilities.Community leaders are excited but have urged sensitive handling of the initiative.Nairn River Community Council chairman Tommy Hogg said: \"That area is part of Nairn\u0027 heritage so they\u0026rsquove got to do it sympathetically or it\u0026rsquoll cause massive problems.\"A council consultation keen to include input from local schools and youth groups is expected to follow in August.Planning officers say \"the time is ripe for a development plan\".Their report suggests building on a trail around Nairn from the Links through Viewfield and along the riverside featuring various attractions for \"people to linger, to learn about Nairn, to take part in an activity and to enjoy their surroundings\".Each point would incorporate a theme and\u0026nbspa dolphin-inspired artwork has been mooted.A draft plan is currently evolving for Nairn\u0027 77-pontoon harbour and waterfront to improve the harbour basin, surrounding buildings and maximise its potential to boost Nairn\u0027 economy.Planned projects include expansion of the pontoon system, increasing capacity to 97 boats and to develop a watersports centre.Other than driving to the links, people generally walk there as there is no public transport to the beach area.The planners say \"there may be an opportunity to operate a land train type tourist train in the summer months, taking people round the links, the harbour, Viewfield and Fishertown.\"Alternatively, there may be potential to develop a miniature railway, of the type used at Whin Park in Inverness.\"Friday 15 Jun 2018 6:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04114000/04114012.jpg","title":"The street has no name six years on","story":"\u0026nbspTHE hunt is on for a name for an Inverness street \u0026ndash after a six-year wait.The road that runs through Milton of Leys has never been named.Highland Council said it was agreed as far back as 2012 that naming the street \"would not be beneficial as it was not providing access to a particular address\".But the council has changed tack after a complaint from the ward\u0027\u0026nbspNon-Aligned Highland councillor Ken Gowans.He said residents were experiencing difficulties directing delivery drivers and added: \"If you had a bad accident on that road how would you identify your position? \"That road is a main thoroughfare that goes right the way down Milton of Leys.

runs along the Cults Burn, between Friarsfield Road and the Cults Hotel.According to organisers, the path regularly floods when there’s rain, making it almost impassible to the public.The group hopes to install drainage along the path, as well as cut back vegetation, when members meet tomorrow.The clean-up is part of a project launched last year, which aims to encourage people to get out and walk

been very wet, so we think there is a spring coming up underneath the path.“It’s been a problem for a while, it puts people off going down there, because in wet weather, it gets really muddy.“We’re looking to sort that out, because it’s a nice walking route, with the burn and the trees.“It’s much better than people having to walk down Kirk Brae, with all the petrol fumes.” The project was set up last year and has already seen one other path in the area restored.Christine said: “We as a community council are trying to encourage more people to walk, to get more exercise and reduce carbon

Stack held workshops with the children and I was sent the material and fashioned it into the final product.“I loved all the things I was sent so much that I wanted to use as much as possible – in particular the photos were so lovely that I wanted to make them a real focus.“I also wanted it to be a real collaboration and I think we’ve achieved that.“For me, it’s been a very new experience and a lot of fun.”Festival associate director Hilary Nicholl said: “We are now in our fourth year and as it is the Year of Young People we’ve made our theme Serious Place.“Each of the art pieces is playable, playful or about play – there’s a lot of interactive stuff.“We are based in Aberdeen and it is all about seeing the city through fresh eyes.”More than 120 artists are contributing to the festival, which runs until Sunday.Hilary said: “It’s very important to us to support creativity within the city. It’s great to be partnering up with RGU for the festival.Festival director Sally Reaper added: “We have an even bigger and better festival lined up for this year and are excited to be working with a host of local, national and international artists to really bring the city to life over the course of four days in June.” One particular piece which has grabbed the attention of a number of people is James Rigler’s A House in the Woods in the centre of Marischal College’s quadrangle.The pink house has been inspired by elements of the college’s architecture.James said: “There are a few different interpretations of the house – it could be a witch’s house, or a home on the prairie as well as having these Gothic elements.“It’s very bright and cheery but it’s also a little bit sinister – sort of like a mashup of the Wizard of Oz and Psycho.“There’s a real juxtaposition in the piece.”Members of the public will also get a sweet treat from the “witch’s house”, with gingerbread ice cream being handed at noon each day to visitors.Libby Curtis, head of RGU’s Gray’s School of Art, added: “We’re thrilled to be celebrating the Year of Young People by joining forces with Look Again and reflecting its theme of Serious Play to spotlight great visual art and design across the city.“As a city of culture and invention, a city with a unique and distinctive identity, we are growing again through a renewed sense of purpose backed by the new Cultural Aberdeen strategy, which both Gray’s and Look Again have played a pivotal part in forming.”Other works on display during the festival include Positive Geographies – an exhibition of new work by 2017 graduates from Gray’s.There will also be performances by Emily Speed tomorrow.This will feature 13 dancers all based in the north-east, dressed as buildings and performing at the Castlegate, Marischal Quad and Broad Street.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 24","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 17/05/18, 11:31 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.We heartily agree with the decision of the Lord Lieutenant to nominate Betty Rhodick to attend the royal wedding.As far as we are aware, no one works harder for Lochgilphead  \u0026#8211 and once Betty puts her mind to something\u0026#8230Betty and Geordie have been the figureheads for the Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations since they started, but she deserves this recognition not just for this one annual event, but for all she does on our behalf.Enjoy yourself, Betty and Kelly.The renovated Kilmartin Museum is now almost within reach.This is sure to be of great economic benefit to the region when it opens in two years and it is an exciting prospect that will enable the unique heritage of Mid Argyll to be properly showcased.Just what was last weekend\u0026#8217s Scapa festival at Ardkinglas?The answer is probably unique to every individual who attended.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000.

If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers.

They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cadets flag up lochgilpheads big day","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 14/06/18, 1:03 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAfter weeks of brilliant sunshine, the weather took a turn for the damp just in time for the flag raising ceremony.This annual midweek event marks the beginning of Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day commemorations, and cadets from D (Argyll) Company ignored the rain to perform the flag raising with their usual efficiency.\u0026nbspThe flag was saluted as it was raised accompanied by tunes from piper John Hunt, before Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day chairman Geordie Rhodick inspected the assembled cadets and thanked them for their attendance.Lochgilphead Armed Forces Day will take place on Saturday June 16, starting at midday with a march down Argyll Street from the Drill Hall, followed by a parade on the front green and an afternoon of fun activities for all the family.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Villagers - and residents across the greenbelt in Muirhead - mounted a stiff rearguard action after a bid to get it zoned for housing. For the first time it emerged a developer WAS behind the plan, rather than, as was insisted, South Ayrshire Council officers just selected it as a prospect. Senior SNP councillor Craig Mackay said on Tuesday it was now “highly unlikely” it would make the next stage. And he told Troon Community Council : “No decisions have been made and we are not out of the woods yet with the Muirhead-Loans site yet. “But on the basis the available land pretty much matches what we need for new housing over the next five years, there should be no need for any release of greenbelt sites. “It is highly unlikely it will be built on.” We revealed the secret plan for the soggy 30 acre field in October, which would link the medieval clachan to the town of Troon. It sparked an emergency meeting of Loans Community Council and the public packed out Troon Community Council meetings.  And at the time town councillor Peter Convery said: “That ground is sacrosanct and it should never have been suggested for the local plan.” Planners were promoting the sight, saying the “layouts of both settlements turn their backs twoards each other at the moment and this doesnt create an attractive approach to either of them.” Councillor Mackay said the house sites currently available “pretty much” matched the demand. And he revealed South Ayrshire Council has now taking a slightly different approach from the developer-led schemes. He added: “Brownfield land will be prioritised even though that is not as lucrative for developers.” Councillor Mackay also revealed a developer had been circling on the Loans site - despite insistence from council officers there was no developer. He said:”Planning officers gave assurances there was no developer.. but there was.”  The breakthrough has been hailed by David Chalmers, chairman of Loans Community Council. He said: “It is obviously encouraging hearing Councillor McKay’s statement that development be allowed on the greenbelt between Loans and Muirhead is unlikely to be adopted in LDP2. “We will, of course, anxiously await SAC’s verification of this which we understand will not be until nearer the end of this year. “Every praise should be given to the overwhelming response given by the residents of Loans and Muirhead - a 367 signature petition and 246 letters - which clearly demonstrated the level of feeling against.” South Ayrshire Council said the process to publish the new Development Plan was still active. A spokesman said: “There are a range of issues that are suggested, discussed and determined. This is a very thorough process to ensure that all stakeholders are given due consideration. As a result, we’ll only be able to give assurance of what is included in, or excluded from the proposed plan when a report is considered by the Council later this year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilTroonAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"council perform u turn over","story":"NewsCouncil perform U-turn over car park feesThe astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:41, 13 JUN 2018NewsSouth Beach car park (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailParking charges WON’T be introduced at two Troon car parks, we can reveal. The astonishing cave-in by wobbling South Ayrshire Council came amidst a 1700-name petition signed by furious residents and businesses. The council ARE pressing ahead with fees at a third Troon car park, at Bellevue in Prestwick and Ayr Blackburn. They argued the \u0026pound2 charge would destroy much-needed trade and lead to chaos in surrounding streets in Troon The U-turn was revealed by Councillor Craig Mackay at Troon Community Council last Tuesday. He managed to finally nail down an answer from his officials, admitting: “This issue has caused confusion within the council.” There will be no charges at the car park at the Walker Hall or the Italian Gardens.  But council officers are pressing ahead with a \u0026pound2 fee at the South Beach car park next to Royal Troon. This lead to anger from Community Councillor Robert Milligan, who said: “I suggest if you are going to charge for South Beach you actually need to provide loos, even temporary between May and September, to meet demand. If people are paying for parking the least we can do is to have toilet facilities without peeing in the dunes. “People are urinating in the sand dunes and residents can see it from their houses.” At the community council police revealed Troon only gets a traffic warden once every 2.8 days. And townspeople feared cars would be abandoned on the streets rather than pay for parking. The Ayrshire Post has led the way on the issue, revealing Troon has NEVER had to pay parking fees. Councillor Mackay said: “ We were working on the basis of parking charges being introduced to three car parks in Troon.  “I had a meeting with senior officers to discuss concerns of residents and businesses, in particular at the Walker Hall. “The knock-on conserquences are complex, particularly with displacement into residential streets.” He finally got an admission the council were axing the charges in a statement from SNP party colleague Ian Cochrane. Councillor Mackay added: “I was still struggling to get full clarity. “Traffic Orders are being progressed at Royal Troon, Belevue Road in Prestwick and Blackburn Road in Ayr. “It came as a surprise to me as the statement said no other parking charges are proposed at this time and that is quite a changes from what we were looking at.” Troon council vice-chairman Dougie Graham added: “We will wait to see what happens.” Five days after being asked for a comment on the U-turn, South Ayrshire Council would only say: “We’re currently finalising plans for the introduction of charges at Blackburn Road, Bellevue Road and Troon seafront car parks – all of which will require a new Traffic Regulation Order (TRO). We’ll soon be getting the TRO process underway, which will include a period of public consultation, and further details on this will be shared in due course.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12539593.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/14478946.jpg","title":"lawrence shankland agrees new deal","story":"NewsLawrence Shankland agrees new deal to stay at Ayr United for Championship pushThe 29-goal striker has put pen to paper on a new deal at Somerset Park.\u0026nbspShareByStuart WilsonLochlin Highet13:14, 15 MAY 2018Updated13:18, 15 MAY 2018NewsShankland is staying on at Somerset (Image: Daily Record)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailLawrence Shankland insists money can’t buy happiness after he sensationally spurned a host of lucrative offers to pen a new deal at Ayr United.

Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football.

Mhari said: “We had the perfect day with amazing weather and a beautiful sunset.  “All our closest friends and family joined us for a simple but loving ceremony carried out by Peter Clark of the Scottish Humanist Society.” The bride wore a Mori lee dress from Bijoux Bridal, Hamilton. Mhari’s veil held a special sentimental value to it. She said: “The veil is 25 years old which was worn by my aunt on her wedding day.” The groom and best men wore Grey Spirit kilts from Slaters, Ayr. The couple’s wedding party consisted of bridesmaids Sara Bryce (bride’s sister) and Lyndsey Bickerton and best men Grant Russell and Mark Rowe (groom’s brother). The newly married Mr and Mrs jetted off for a fortnight in the sun after the big day.  The couple said: “We flew to St Lucia for 2 weeks and stayed at The Royalton. “It was amazing - so relaxed, exactly what we needed after the wedding.” Adore Weddings captured the couple’s big day, with both photography and videography, leaving them with lovely memories to look back on. Mhari added: “Both Barrie and Jim were fantastic all day, with us and all the guests. “The pictures are just too hard to pick from.” Stems and Gems in Saltcoats created the bouquets, buttonholes and flowers for the centrepieces while the cake was made by a relative.  Mhari said: “The cake was made by my aunt. “It was baked in Norwich then driven all the way to Scotland and built. “All the flowers are made of icing to match the flowers in my bouquet.” Linzi of Linzi Smith Hair at Distinction styled the hair for the day while Elaine Sawyer of Lookz Mobile Makeup Artist created the makeup looks. The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who travelled the distance to make our special day - some all the way from Texas. “Also a massive thank you to Ryan and Stacey of The Waterside - our day ran perfectly all thanks to them.” For more photos of this week\u0027s Wedding of the Week, pick up your copy of the Ayrshire Post.

Stuart Laing gets a glittering OBE for nearly 50 years hard graft in the shiny world of jewellery. And Kirsty Letton is now an MBE after more than four decades of dedication to Scottish curling. That they live within 500 yards of each other in Troon is highly noteworthy in that NOBODY else who lives in mainland Ayrshire received anything this year. Stuart,68, has been honoured not just for running the family’s firm Laings, but his foundation of a UK consortium that allowed independents to flourish. He said: “I am thrilled and delighted to speak about it . . . this has been very difficult not to mention.  “I am proud and honoured, but also very humbled as well.” In 1970 he joined the family firm which was begun 130 years earlier. He expanded it to seven branches and started the Houlden (his mother’s maiden name) buying and professional services group for independent jewellers. Stuart remains active as executive chairman of Laings, though his son-in-law Joe Walsh is now chief executive. The father-of-three and now grandad-to-five has been such an influence in the jewellery market he’s regarded by the trade throughout the world. He said: “Strengthening and creating a strong, independent retail sector and giving the UK industry a global identity has been extremely rewarding.” “But this honour is for my entire family and colleagues as a lot of people have been with me on this journey.”  Stuart and his wife Lynda have three children - son Simon and daughters Susanna Laing, and Wendy Walsh. Stuart added: “I would like to pay tribute to my wife Lynda, she has been a wonderful support, a real rock. “We have travelled the globe together representing the UK trade.” He also created the ‘Jewellers of Excellence’ brand, which is a hallmark of trust within the industry. Stuart has been involved in all aspects of the industry and was the only UK Director of SIHH (Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie), a renowned association of the best jewellers in the world, in co-operation with high-end watch houses. Curling champion and coach Kirsty Letton reckons her MBE is an accolade for the entire sport. She says: “Of course I am thrilled and proud. It was a big surprise, I must admit.”  And so are the family - husband Jimmy and children Avril, who now lives in Ascot, and Keith who is in Grenada. Superfit Kirsty - now a 77-year-old grandmother of three - is still playing on the rink as well as coaching at Ayr and manages to find the time to grab an oar for some coastal rowing. Last year she picked up a Sportscotland lifetime volunteering award. And although moving to Ayrshire 21 years ago and joining the Troon Portland club the link with her orginal Glasgow four has never been broken. The highlight of Kirsty’s playing career was winning senior silver in the World Championships in Finland in 2008. She is particularly proud of motivating South Ayrshire primary pupils to have fun on the ice, with 269 youngsters participating in her taster sessions last season.  As well as inspiring the stars of tomorrow, Kirsty instigated the strongly contested World Senior Curling Championships in 2000. She also set up the Glynhill Ladies Curling International event, which attracts world-class teams. Kirsty added: “I don’t know where I would be without curling. It has been a huge part of my life for 40 years. “Last week Ayr Curling Club got the active schools gold award for South Ayrshire and it is things like that which keep me going.” Ayrshire’s Lord-Lieutenant Iona McDonald congratulated the pair. She said: “They have made a considerable contribution to our communities and I am sure that this award comes as a great surprise, as many of them do not seek any recognition for the work that they do. •The Edinburgh-based business grandee Sir Brian Gammell Ivory, gets a CBE for his chairmanship role at Dumfries House.

The bill for absent workers comes on the back of 42,736 days lost during the last 12 months. Employees recorded an average of nine days on the sick during 2017/18. Psychological reasons (30 per cent) were cited as the leading cause for absence, followed by musculoskeletal (19 per cent) and hospitalisation (12 per cent). By far the biggest service to feel the strain was the Health and Social Care Partnership, where an average of 16 days per employee was lost. Teachers, who account for 23 per cent of the council’s workforce, were the best performing ‘directorate’ with a loss of just five days per worker.  All figures were recorded between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. Council officials said trends were showing a “gradual and consistent improvement”. An average of 11.7 days were lost to absence by local government employees (all staff bar teachers) in 2010. The revised figure stands at 10.06 days for 2017/18. A council spokesman said they were “committed” to supporting staff and have a “number of policies and supports in place to maximise employee attendance”. They added: “In recent years, more robust monitoring and reporting arrangements have been introduced which have seen a steady improvement in this area, with our figures below the national average. “We continue to closely monitor employee attendance levels and take all appropriate steps to ensure appropriate standards.” "},{"url":null,"title":"Lowood Bridge closure  SBC release update","story":"GOOD news for motorists - council bosses have confirmed that works to Lowood Bridge are set to be complete in time for Melrose Festival Week.\nThe project is in its final stages and remains on schedule to be completed by Monday, June 18, the day of the Melrosian Rideout.\nSo far, the temporary scaffolding has been removed, which means works on the bridge deck area can start.\nRepairs to the bridge\u0027s stonework are now complete, as well as resurfacing of the Waverley Road/Lowood Road junction.

after it was confirmed this week that the Post Office is returning to the town.\nAt the meeting of the town\u0026rsquos community council on Monday evening, chairman Marshall Douglas revealed that the owners of The Allotment store, based across from the Bank of Scotland on the High Street, have managed to seal the deal with post bosses to restore a service.\nIt comes after a year and a half without a full-time offering.\nMr Douglas said: \u0026ldquoThis is tremendous news for the town.\n\u0026ldquoI would like to thank Susan Meikle for stepping up to secure a permanent Post Office facility here in Innerleithen.\n\u0026ldquoSusan has confirmed that the new Post Office concession will be opening on Wednesday, August 29, at 1pm.\nThe delivery of the news brings an end to a long-running saga to reinstate a full-time service in the town.\nIn February 2017, the Border  and Peeblesshire News reported that the concession within the Daymart Newsagents on the town\u0026rsquos High Street had closed.\nThis sparked a six-week consultation by the Post Office on proposals to operate a one-day mobile service in the town.\nThe consultation was met with a huge backlash from local politicians and residents, who set up a petition to restore full Post Office services in Innerleithen and the launch of an appeal for local businesses to come forward to take on a concession within their stores.\nJust weeks after the announcement, local businessman Andrew Caldwell, of Caldwell\u0026rsquos Ices, came up with a plan to open the service within his store.\nBut a row over the opening hours with Post Office bosses soon put a stop to the idea.\nWhile the town has been without a permanent service, a mobile service has operated for several hours each Friday in Innerleithen, forcing residents who urgently need to make postal deliveries to travel east to Walkerburn, or west to Peebles to do so.\nA spokesperson from the Post Office told us that, while plans are yet to be finalised, further details about the reopening, including information about the range of services that will be on offer to customers, will be released in due course.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Work to begin on

months to gain permission to repair several memorials in the village graveyard.\nAnd now they have also received \u0026pound15,000 of funding from the Toddleburn (Parish of Stow) Wind Farm Community Fund to help with the work.\nThe graveyard, which contains the remains of Stow\u0026rsquos Auld Kirk as well as memorials dating back to the 17th century, has been in need of repair for decades.\nStow and Fountainhall Community Council worked with Scottish Borders Council and Historic Environment Scotland to gain the required permissions as the Auld Kirk is a scheduled monument.\nThe Auld Kirk, which was consecrated in 1242, has previously been painstakingly restored by local resident Robin McMillan.\nAnd the restoration of the graveyard will complete his work to showcase part of the fascinating medieval history of Stow.\nAlistair Riddell of Stow and Fountainhall Community Council told the Border : \u0026ldquoThe repairs to the graveyard have long been a priority for the local community and it is great to finally get the first grant of money to allow these works to go ahead.\n\"There is a lot of specialist work to be undertaken and the repairs may take several years to complete.\n\"However, once finished the old graveyard will become a real focus for locals and visitors alike.\nStow\u0027s history includes a visit in 1142 by King David I, a visit in 1297 by William Wallace and a visit in 1513 by Queen Margaret Tudor, wife of James IV, prior to the battle of Flodden.\nThe restoration, which is widely supported across the local community, will commence this summer with the repair of an iconic monument, after the required funding was donated by residents of Stow.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Mum and baby left shaken after crossing near miss in

It might make you laugh.Somewhere along the line, in the last five or six years, the world seems to have developed a serious crack in its funny bone.And I do mean serious, no crack intended.And there I go again, being flippant, trying to raise a smile in one or two readers, even if it might resemble a risus sardonicus. (It’s how people on Sardinia used to grin, that’s why.)It’s a congenital condition – like my idiocy, claims my wife– that ever since I was young I made outrageous statements and people would say to me: \u0026#8216You can’t be serious.\u0026#8217 \u0026#8216Not on a regular basis, no,\u0026#8217 was my usual reply.For the greater part of my 70-odd years, while laughter was still an acceptable knee-jerk reaction to almost anything, I prospered, in a vaguely penniless way, as a freelance writer of would-be humorous journalism.Nothing too fancy, no slipping on banana skins, but not rocket science either.  (Although the rotation of the Earth really makes my day.)In retrospect, I see now that my humour wasn’t serious enough. It had no underlying message.  It had no sociological content.  It was not of the variety that allowed people to feel wise, nod wisely, and say something wise, like: \u0026#8216Very wise…\u0026#8217The mistakes of the past – of my past – included trying to make people lose control and laugh aloud, rather than just being able to smirk knowingly at my cleverness, if I ever was.We live in a much more buttoned-up, uptight and insecure society than we used to (do you feel my sociological message approaching?) and it has affected the sort of things we feel we are permitted to laugh at, or not permitted to laugh at.Scorn and ridicule can no longer be directed at certain people with impunity – the dishonourable exception being bankers and politicians, of course, who are still fair game, and rightly so, even if out on bail and technically innocent because they haven’t been charged yet.But when did you last hear a blitz of jokes from a television comedian about a small, ethnic, obese, female bishop, even if she was his mother-in-law?Don’t worry, the news isn’t all bad, and I can report that sometimes outbreaks of laughter can occur in the most unusual places – Dundee, for example – and at the most unexpected times.Not long ago I saw a funeral procession led by a slow-marching, black-suited chaplain who was laughing his head off as he walked along in front of the hearse.As I watched in amazement, his happy demeanour began to affect his slow progress, which became a sprightly strut, and it seemed at any moment he might twirl his top hat in his hands, or even produce a rabbit from it.Only when I caught sight of the wireless device attached to his ear did I guess he was probably listening to dance music on a radio earbud. Death is no respecter of parsons.Let’s hope the worst extremes of political correctness will gradually fade away, as common sense brings a return to humorous nonsense, and seriousness wilts in the face of jocularity.A life without laughter?You must be joking.David Aitken,Dundee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter mok run thankyou","story":"The continued outstanding success of Mok Run race weekend is a reflection of the ever-increasing dedication and commitment its hard working committee, community volunteers, local businesses, enthusiastic runners and crowd supporter’s display year after year.On behalf of myself and the Mok Run committee I would like to say a massive thank you to those who contributed their free time and energy to make this happen for the 13th consecutive year.Each year we are given tremendous support from many individuals and organisations listed here and this is very much appreciated.Sincere thanks to: Campbeltown Co-op, Wee Toon Sports , McFadyens, Mach Dunes, Tunnocks, AM Transport, Argyll Bakeries, Seafield Hotel, Campbeltown Pottery, Kintyre Agricultural Society,  Jim Martin Supplies, Killegruer Caravan Site, Machrihanish Holiday Park, Glen Scotia, Spring Bank, Beinn An Tuirc, Live Argyll,  Stewart Balfour and Sutherland, Campbeltown Running Club, Jogscotland and Wee Toon Warriors.By supporting this event, you have made a concrete contribution to the greater community.I would also like to extend my grateful thanks to: all the MOK Run committee members who work tirelessly behind the scenes our race marshals \u0026#8211 without whom this event would not happen race sweepers  race day commentator Councillor John Armour Gavin Reid Johnny Durnan David McMillan Willie Ralston Barrs Clochkeil Councillor Donald Kelly Argyll and Bute Council amenities team Campbeltown Police Office Southend Scouts Campbeltown\u0026#8217s: Young Fire Fighters Coastguard Sea Cadets Police Scotland Youth Volunteers massage therapists Brass Band Kintyre Schools Pipe Band West Coast EMT Jamie G  South Kintyre Sports Council \u0026#8211 for making our legendary post race ceilidh such a success Dalintober primary pupils for their motivational posters to our photographers: John McFadyen Campbeltown Courier\u0026#8217s Mark Davey Kenny Craig and Greg and Norma Grogan for capturing the spirit of the weekend Fiona and Donna Robertson and all the Junior MOK Run volunteers and to many of our other volunteers who took the time to help on race day.Apologies if I have missed anyone.A special thank you once again goes to the residents of Limecraigs, for taking the time to decorate the street, provide well received ‘showers’ along with the local fire brigade ‘shower’ who came out in full force to cheer the runners on in the final leg of the 10K route.As one runner summed it up on our facebook page: \u0026#8216Fantastic day !\u0026#8216Thanking all the organisers, marshals, water-givers, water-hosers, sweety-givers, pipers, drummers, sandwich and pastry makers, and everyone else involved.

For services to the Scottish seafood industry.\u0026#8217Mr MacMillan, from Carradale, East Kintyre, has already been invited to the Palace of Holyroodhouse garden party on Wednesday July 4.During more than half a century in the industry, Mr MacMillan, 72, has moved from working on a fishing boat, ring netting herring, to fine tuning a computer-controlled smoker to create smoked products for worldwide export.Mr MacMillan, has six employees, one of whom said: \u0026#8216Archie was awarded an MBE for being the best boss.\u0026#8217He took control of the artisan business in 1988 and has incrementally improved it ever since, eventually buying a £60,000 computer controlled smoker which it took him three months to fine tune.Mr MacMillan\u0026#8217s life in the seafood business started at the sharp end. Aged 15,  in 1961 he went to sea in the Amy Harris with an uncle.Mr MacMillan, who eats fish most days, said: \u0026#8216Sometimes in the mid-1960s we were earning between £9 and £11 a week which was a good wage.\u0026#8216It was spring 1962 when we started fishing for scallops and the price of a dozen sold to London was 12/6.\u0026#8217It was a brother of his mother, Mary MacMillan, née Paterson, Archie Paterson, who taught him all he knew, in a decade aboard Harvest Queen.By 1972 some Clyde boats were gearing up for pair trawling, where a net is trawled between two boats.Mr MacMillan, helped with a £12,000 loan from the Highlands and Islands Development Board, bought his own boat, Remembrance, from Finlay Cunningham.For pair trawling Mr MacMillan worked with a partner James Rennie on Monarch and in the 1980s they began exporting scallops to markets, including Belgium, Barcelona and Johannesburg.At the same time as fishing from a boat Mr MacMillan was learning about smoking products.\u0026#8216I used to come to the smokehouse when the weather was too bad to go out on the boat,\u0026#8217 said Mr MacMillan, \u0026#8216That is how I learned to smoke fish \u0026#8211 such as kippers.\u0026#8216It was different days there were not environmental health officers coming chapping at the door,\u0026#8217 added the man who has a prized certificate from SALSA \u0026#8211 Safe and Local Supplier Approval for hot and cold smoking of salmon. Cold smoking of haddock, herring, scallops, mussels and cheese.MacMillan Food\u0026#8217s environmental efforts have also been recognised by the Carbon Trust.That certificate states: \u0026#8216Cutting carbon emissions. Recognising achievements of organisations in tackling climate change.\u0026#8216Given in recognition and appreciation of your organisation\u0026#8217s effort in the field of carbon management, emission reduction and the mitigation of climate change in 2012.\u0026#8217Mr MacMillan added: \u0026#8216Since I bought the smokery from Donnie Gilchrist we have used every inch of ground and moved into two units opposite.\u0026#8217At those two units, Mr MacMillan\u0026#8217s wife Jane has a well equipped kitchen and cold store and creates seafood specialities.The couple like nothing better than driving through the night from Kintyre to attend central belt farmer\u0026#8217s markets.They have a loyal following in Glasgow and Edinburgh and Mr MacMillan says he loves meeting his customers face to face.Locally in Kintyre most of the hotels and guest houses proudly state that they serve Smokehouse products.At the same time his products have gained international recognition.Last month Smokehouse products were chosen for the Eden dinner, at the British embassy in Singapore, during Food and Hotel Asia, the continent\u0026#8217s most comprehensive international food and hospitality event.As news of the MBE award came, Mr MacMillan was also considering a request from a New Zealand firm to stock his products.Mr MacMillan is the first to acknowledge that the firm\u0026#8217s success is a team effort.He said: \u0026#8216It is the same in every business you rely on having great staff or on a fishing boat, a good crew and everything runs smoothly.\u0026#8216One member of staff has just left and we are looking for a trainee to learn all aspects of the business including filleting fish, working the smoking machines and labeling products.\u0026#8216I never thought I would get anything like this.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.

Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

Musselburgh\u0026rsquos Iceland store is back open after being closed for the refurbishment project.  The premises at Olive Bank Retail Park has a completely new layout and design, including the installation of new fascia and frontage, digital signage, LED lighting, improved in-store navigation and new checkouts that are quicker and easier to use.  The alcohol side of the business was discussed at a recent meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board in Haddington.  An increase in the display of alcohol of 8.8 square metres was proposed and given the green light by the committee\u0026rsquos councillors.  A detailed statement was provided to the committee which outlined the revamp both inside and outside the shop.  It read: \u0026ldquoThe result will be a modern, bright, accessible and customer-friendly store with a focus on quality. This will transcend all ranges and lines including alcohol.  \u0026ldquoWhilst alcohol is very much ancillary to the overall offer, there is a desire to incorporate premium wines and craft beers.  In a bid to prevent items being stolen, members heard how various measures were being taken to cut down on the chances of theft.  New CCTV has been installed throughout the store, while various bottles of alcohol are only accessed through a member of staff opening a locked cabinet.  Similarly, a number of \u0026ldquohigh value lines, including alcohol and various cuts of meat, are on \u0026ldquosmart shelves which sense when an item is lifted and alerts a member of staff through a pager.

Neil Hayes, Iceland\u0026rsquos merchandising and format development director, said: \u0026ldquoRefurbishments on this scale are only possible if we close the stores for a time and I am grateful to all our customers in Musselburgh for their patience.

John Muir Park has regularly been used by teenagers who are celebrating the end of their exams.  But in recent years there have been complaints regarding underage drinking, with about 200 people at the park\u0026rsquos Bullet Hill in 2016.  Police have patrolled the area after concerns at public meetings regarding underage drinking and the flouting of local bylaws involving drinking in a public place.  On Friday and Saturday, police and community wardens seized the alcohol from youngsters aged 14 to 21, with a variety of lager, cider and spirits, including 12 litres of vodka, taken.  Inspector Andrew Harborow said: \u0026ldquoEvery year around this time we are aware of youths congregating at Bullet Hill. Whilst this started out as an end-of-school celebration involving those mainly in S6, the ages of those taking part has clearly widened.  \u0026ldquoIn order to reduce the risk to those involved, we have taken action over the weekend and seized alcohol to prevent harm being caused and will be making follow-up enquiries with parents, carers and local shops as to where the alcohol came from.

The Musselburgh MSP met with doctors and staff at the surgery, along with representatives from East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership.

Jess Mackie\u0026rsquos family created the fund in her name after the Gullane youngster, who loved to sing and help others, passed away suddenly on January 2 this year.  The North Berwick High School pupil was a member of the National Youth Choir of Scotland and sang with Aberlady and Gullane Parish Churches, at care homes and for charities, and at school concerts.  Despite her young age, she had a sense of how music could help people in need.  And now the Jess Mackie Memorial Fund will \u0026ldquohelp her to keep helping others, as she had always done, and would have continued to do if she was still with us, said parents Michael and Jackie.  \u0026ldquoWe cannot let our beautiful daughter\u0026rsquos name and character be forgotten, they said. \u0026ldquoShe had so much to offer.  All monies raised will be used to provide support and comfort through music therapy at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh.  Dad Michael, long-standing chairman of Gullane Sports Development Trust, said: \u0026ldquoWhen Jess passed away, we had a memorial service for her and decided to use it to donate to the Edinburgh Children\u0026rsquos Hospital Charity. Quickly thereafter, we learnt about an initiative involving music therapy they were running with Tinderbox Orchestra in the hospital. We met with one of the trustees initially and we decided to put in place something that would allow Jess to help other kids.  The memorial service, which was held at Aberlady Parish Church, raised more than \u0026pound2,000, with money continuing to be donated by members of the public and through organised events.  Michael, 52, said: \u0026ldquoWe were approached by Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches and they asked if they could run an event in Jess\u0026rsquo memory, which they did last Sunday.  \u0026ldquoFrom the family point of view, it was another show of overwhelming support by the village and the community. We have raised a substantial amount of money. Gullane and Aberlady Parish Churches posted on Facebook that it had raised about \u0026pound1,800 for the fund and Gullane Athletic [FC] are running an event in August in support of the fund.  Twelve members of staff at North Berwick High School also took part in the recent Edinburgh Marathon Relay.  Split into three teams, they raised more than \u0026pound1,500 for The Royal Hospital for Sick Children Jess Mackie Memorial Fund, Richmond\u0026rsquos Hope and Leuchie House.  Jess, who was in S3 at the secondary school, was, like her twin sister Lauren, a keen singer.  Her dad told the Courier Jess \u0026ldquoloved singing and tried to help people and raise their spirits through her voice.  That love of singing and trying to help people has been mirrored through the success of the memorial fund, which sits at about \u0026pound9,800.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoI think that the fund reflects Jess completely. It reflects the impact she had while only 14 years old.  \u0026ldquoIt reflects the impact she had on people that she met and what she did in terms of her church singing, singing in local care homes, school concerts, helping out at various events like for the Bethany Christian Trust and Leuchie House. I think that reflects what she did while she was here.  The project aims to ensure children and young people who are feeling vulnerable in hospital are given the chance to enjoy music, which can have an enormous and positive impact, helping ignite a spark in them and giving them back a sense of control.  Michael added: \u0026ldquoMusic is a great comforter at times and what Tinderbox do is amazing for the kids.  \u0026ldquoWe had no hesitation in supporting what they do.  Janet Anderson, who is involved with the choirs at the two villages\u0026rsquo churches, also paid tribute to the talented teenager.  She said: \u0026ldquoI could not speak more highly of Jess.  \u0026ldquoShe did not think she had a special talent, she was just the most unassuming, normal girl you would ever meet.  \u0026ldquoShe was so pretty, so kind and so thoughtful and generous and she never thought she was anything special.

Chester, from Dunbar, is one of 13 pets, including cats, dogs and even a rat, taking part in the PDSA Pet Fit Club.  Together they weigh more than 200 kilogrammes and need to shed 75kg to reach their ideal weights.  Ten-year-old Chester, who lives with the Gilmour family on Newhouse Avenue, is looking to shift 2.6kg \u0026ndash or six pounds \u0026ndash to reach his ideal weight.  Chester, who tips the scales at 7.6kg, was gaining so much weight that his owners thought he must have an underlying medical condition. But when tests came back negative, it was clear Chester\u0026rsquos appetite and lazy ways were the root of the problem.  Owner Lisa said: \u0026ldquoWe realised everyone in the house was feeding him without knowing he\u0026rsquod already being fed, so he was getting fed by all four of us every day!  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove tried to help him lose weight, even putting a collar on him that says \u0026lsquoDo not feed me!\u0026rsquo for the neighbours, but that hasn\u0026rsquot worked.  \u0026ldquoHe eats whatever he can find including crisps left on the floor by the kids. He even stole my dad\u0026rsquos cheesecake that was on the kitchen counter! Another time my son woke up to the sound of rattling and he was trying to claw his way into a box of chocolates.  Lisa, along with partner Lindsay and sons Rhys and Ryan, got Chester when he was just a kitten.  Now they are determined to do what they can to help their pet lose some weight and be happier.  Lisa, who works in the family newsagent, added: \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos getting older now and his weight will play on his joints if we don\u0026rsquot do something to help him. He can\u0026rsquot be comfortable carrying all that weight around and we want him to be happier and healthier as he ages.  Chester\u0026rsquos six-month Pet Fit Club diet and exercise programme will be specially tailored and overseen by the vets and nurses at Edinburgh PDSA Pet Hospital.  He is up against seven dogs, including a Cavalier King Charles spaniel who once ate a set of false teeth, a cat too fat to fit through the cat flap, and a rat who is double his ideal bodyweight.  If crowned the winner, Chester will receive a year\u0026rsquos supply of pet food, a pet-friendly holiday and a pet hamper.  Kathryn Marshall, PDSA Veterinary Care Assistant, will be helping to oversee Chester\u0026rsquos diet.  She said: \u0026ldquoWith the help of PDSA and Pet Fit Club, Lisa and Chester are making the necessary diet, exercise and lifestyle changes to help get Chester down to a healthier weight.  \u0026ldquoWe will support them every step of the way over the next six months to ensure they succeed."},{"url":null,"title":"Log found at Yellowcraig beach transformed into stunning violin","story":"              A VIOLIN maker has crafted a violin from driftwood found on an East Lothian beach to help raise awareness about the environment and the plight of the oceans.

Len Smith, 92, was conscripted at the age of 18 and was a supply lorry driver for the British Liberation Army.  He landed at Gold Beach, Normandy, where he said he was not shot at and saw little combat.  But he drove some of the first troops into Berlin in 1945 and moved supplies through a war-ravaged France, Belgium, Holland and Germany.  Despite his actions, modest Len, who went on to work in the civil service, said he had never thought of himself as veteran, never mind a hero.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoThere were thousands of young men like me. I never considered myself a veteran until the recent events marking the anniversary led to me looking back.  \u0026ldquoAt the time we just got on with it the real heroes are the soldiers who fought and died over there.  Mr Smith was one of eight children born in Pencaitland to local couple John and Euphemia Smith.  His sister Ellen, 97, still lives in Pencaitland and he visits the area regularly but after he was demobbed in 1947, Mr Smith moved to Longlevens, Gloucestershire, to find work.  Now a widower, Mr Smith\u0026rsquos sister sends him the Courier every week so he can keep up with local news.  His L\u0026eacutegion d\u0026rsquoHonneur medal was sent to his home in Cheltenham by post and contained a letter from Jean-Pierre Jouyet, French ambassador to the UK, which said: \u0026ldquoI offer you my warmest congratulations on this high honour, which recognises your military engagement and steadfast involvement in the liberation of France during the Second World War.  \u0026ldquoAs we contemplate this Europe of peace, we must never forget the heroes like you who came from Britain and the Commonwealth to begin the liberation of Europe by liberating France.

I was a young lad and I had no fear.  \u0026ldquoI just thought \u0026lsquoget on with it\u0026rsquo.  However, he remembers thinking about how worried his mother would be.

Inspectors returned to the school 12 months on from the original report for a follow-up inspection, which led to a new report being published on Tuesday.  The inspection team talked to young people at the school and worked closely with the interim headteacher Lauren Rodger, who is returning to North Berwick High School after the summer holidays.  She will be replaced by Susan Cook, currently acting headteacher at Trinity Academy, Edinburgh  Other members of staff were also spoken to, to hear about the steps the school had taken to improve on areas previously identified in the original inspection.  Education Scotland noted the following key improvements:  - The interim headteacher has provided effective leadership in taking forward work to secure improvements, including a review of the school values  - Staff have developed a range of policies to improve practice in equalities and inclusion, including a new safeguarding policy  - The recently created Pupil Support Faculty is now better placed to address the needs of young people, and those with social, emotional and behavioural needs in particular  - The school has made progress in establishing a more positive learning environment for all.  The report did note that there were still some improvements to be made.  Issues highlighted included using evidence from self-evaluation activities to ensure consistency in learning and teaching across the school reviewing the purpose of the pupil support base to ensure there was a greater focus on learning for the young people using it and ensuring there was a whole school approach to equalities and inclusion.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, praised staff at the school for their efforts.  She said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that Education Scotland acknowledges that Knox Academy has made important progress since the last inspection, and I would like to thank all the staff and pupils for their hard work and commitment in making these improvements.  \u0026ldquoIt is really encouraging that the positive relationships between pupils and teachers, and the fact that almost all young people recognise the value of learning in their lives, was noted.  \u0026ldquoThis is a strong basis for ensuring that the school continues to be a positive learning environment for staff and pupils alike.  And she added: \u0026ldquoWe will continue to work with the school and Education Scotland to make further improvements, and to working with Susan Cook, our new headteacher, who joins the school in August.

Philip Mellor, DTA chairman, said that the group \u0026ldquostrongly oppose the introduction of parking charges.  A petition, which was put in various businesses in the town, has attracted more than 2,000 signatures.  Mr Mellor added: \u0026ldquoThe DTA feel introducing parking charges to High Street and other key off-street parking areas will have a detrimental effect on our High Street and the local economy.  \u0026ldquoThe current system since the introduction of traffic wardens has already addressed concerns around space for shoppers on High Street and it now seems counterintuitive to then introduce a measure which will drive more customers away to out-of-town developments.  \u0026ldquoWhilst parking during heavy summer visitor times can be difficult, it is very few special event days where parking is congested enough to even consider parking charges viable the majority of the time parking is available and this potential charge seems to be nothing more than a money-raising exercise at the expense yet again of already-struggling independent business owners.  A spokesman for East Lothian Council said \u0026ldquoall responses would be taken into consideration as it looked to develop a strategy.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe draft Local Transport Strategy (LTS) sets out ways in which the council can meet both national and local objectives sustainably, while supporting the local economy and environment.  \u0026ldquoOur consultation on the draft LTS recently closed and we are grateful to everyone who responded or attended one of our workshops. We are grateful for and value all responses, which will be taken into consideration as we look to agree a strategy which meets future needs in and around our communities."},{"url":null,"title":"Port Seton Lottery winner climbs Ben Nevis for highest champagne spray","story":"              LOTTERY millionaire John Edmond has undertaken a suitably large-scale celebration to mark the creation of the National Lottery\u0026rsquos 5,000th millionaire. . . by climbing Ben Nevis to conduct the UK\u0026rsquos highest Lottery champagne spray!  John, 35, from Port Seton, won \u0026pound1 million in the EuroMillions draw on June 26, 2015, but he remained in his job as a roofer, insisting he wanted to keep working.  He took on the challenge to climb more than 4,400 feet and faced treacherous weather conditions to mark the Lottery\u0026rsquos milestone and tick off a lifelong dream from his bucket list.  It comes as new research reveals that more than half of the millionaires are now spending more on experiences rather than possessions.  Looking at their shopping trends across time, out have gone designer watches, ride-on mowers, racehorses and conservatories, and in have come protecting woodlands, paying university fees and bar/games rooms.  John said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always wanted to climb Ben Nevis so when the opportunity arose, I was up for the challenge.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not an avid hill walker, nor do I have much climbing experience, so I was a bit nervous as I knew I would have my work cut out \u0026ndash but excited to be part of this once-in-a-lifetime celebration.  \u0026ldquoScotland was looking glorious in the sunshine when we initially left ground level however, the conditions quickly changed as we reached the halfway mark \u0026ndash typical Scottish weather!  \u0026ldquoVisibility was poor, I couldn\u0026rsquot see two or three feet in front of me, and the wind speeds were averaging 40mph.  \u0026ldquoThe heavy snow on the ground made it more challenging \u0026ndash but to me, it was all part of the adventure.  \u0026ldquoWith tough climbing, there were moments I was unsure if I was going to make it to the top, so I can\u0026rsquot put into words how I felt when I finally reached the summit.  \u0026ldquoTo know I was standing on the UK\u0026rsquos highest peak was an unbelievable achievement, made all the better with a chilled glass of champagne in my hand.  \u0026ldquoI was honoured that the National Lottery asked me to participate in this opportunity out of all the millionaires in Scotland \u0026ndash it\u0026rsquos certainly one I will never forget.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.  Current headteacher Seonaid McGillivray is set to be appointed at another as yet unnamed school in the county, with the final details expected to be tied up within a matter of days.  Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

A pressure group called \u0026lsquoBowls for Gullane\u0026rsquo was established on Facebook in the wake of concerns that the village\u0026rsquos bowling club \u0026ndash with a membership of only about 30 \u0026ndash was to be sold to developers.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees. People do not want to see the club close.  Gordon McLelland, a local resident and member of the community council, added: \u0026ldquoThe community council want to save the club for the community.  \u0026ldquoWe have tried hard to offer the club our support to work with them but so far they have turned that down.  Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council confirmed the land was earmarked for leisure and recreation use in the Local Development Plan and any deviation from that would require planning permission for a potential change of use."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7297144.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington hosts world record attempt for the Slosh dance","story":"              HUNDREDS of people are set to lace up their dancing shoes in a bid to break a world record.

Persimmon Homes is hoping to get the go-ahead \u0026ldquoin principle from East Lothian Council for the mixed-use development, which includes a commercial hub with hotel, retail facilities and cafe/restaurant.  Community facilities such as a residential neighbourhood centre, playing fields, changing facilities and public parks are proposed.  Also planned is the construction of a grade-separated junction on the A1, roads and foot/cycle paths, as well as improvement to the Musselburgh rail halt.  Submission of the planning application in principle follows a Proposal of Application Notice and public consultation exercise for the major scheme, which included an exhibition on the draft masterplan at The Brunton last year.  A planning statement from Holder Planning, acting for Persimmon, read: \u0026ldquoThe application site is allocated for the mixed use development proposed in the soon-to-be adopted East Lothian Local Development Plan.  \u0026ldquoThe proposed development will deliver 1,500 homes across the site. These homes will comprise a range of housing types. Twenty-five per cent of the housing provision will be affordable as defined by the council.  \u0026ldquoA primary school is proposed that will accommodate the requirements arising from residential development on the wider site. It is located centrally in the application site within walking distance of new homes via a network of paths that offer safe and convenient links. The detailed design will be in accordance with the requirements of the education authority, East Lothian Council.  \u0026ldquoThe masterplan proposes enhancing a pedestrian link under the A1 that will link the site areas together, allowing new neighbourhoods and services to the west, identified in the wider masterplan, to gain access to Musselburgh Station and services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThe proposal incorporates a significant network of multi-functional open spaces and semi-natural landscape areas, including allotments/community growing space, natural play areas, sports pitches and outdoor gym facilities, and seating. This framework of green space will contribute to the legibility of the neighbourhood\u0026rsquos spatial pattern, establishing distinct areas of new housing linked together via a network of green foot and cycle routes.  A new research and innovation quarter for East Lothian offering more than 20 hectares of new commercial space is proposed.  The planning statement added: \u0026ldquoWith strong links to the adjacent Queen Margaret University, the site offers the potential to build upon the reputation of Edinburgh and the Lothians for its research and innovation.  Barry Turner, spokesman for Musselburgh Conservation Society, said: \u0026ldquoThe issue at Craighall is that major development here will be very close to major development in Edinburgh at Newcraighall and in Midlothian at Shawfair, turning the whole area into a cross-boundary urban sprawl and effectively an extension to Edinburgh\u0026rsquos built-up area.  Predicting that the plan for 1,500 houses would be approved, given that was the number in the Local Development Plan, he added: \u0026ldquoAll that we can hope for is that conditions will be put in place to make this amount of housing as acceptable as possible in terms of layout, design, amenities and access to walking and cycling routes and to public transport.  \u0026ldquoOf note is that the secondary-age children here will have to get to Musselburgh Grammar School, which is some distance away and not an easy walk, certainly not from the other side of the A1.  \u0026ldquoThe recently promoted Active Travel Network shows no cycle link to Musselburgh Grammar School. We are worried about the prospect of increased car usage to get kids to and from school thus adding to the gradually worsening traffic problems in the town.  Jim Kirkpatrick, managing director of Persimmon Homes East Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe have had extensive engagement with East Lothian Council and the local community prior to the application being lodged and have generally been encouraged by the positive response to our masterplan.  \u0026ldquoThe comments of Musselburgh Conservation Society are noted and we believe the issues raised are addressed in the suite of information provided to the council.  \u0026ldquoThe application is fully compliant with the proposals contained within the emerging East Lothian Local Development Plan and we look forward to working with officers and other stakeholders during the determination process."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7868119.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"12 new rules the council is making over selfish parking in Musselburgh","story":"              A RAFT of traffic restrictions are to be introduced in Musselburgh to control inconsiderate parking.

Introducing no waiting, loading and unloading at Inveresk Road, opposite Musselburgh Grammar School\u0026rsquos car park, to prevent inconsiderate parking  2. Putting waiting restrictions at the entrance to Loretto Court to control indiscriminate parking and free flow of traffic  3. Introducing waiting restrictions at the entrances into Loretto School at Linkfield Road to control indiscriminate parking and improve sightlines  4. Introducing no waiting, loading and unloading at junctions on Eskview Terrace to stop inconsiderate parking and create a loading bay in the layby at local shops  5. Removing a section of double yellow lines over a private driveway at Millhill  6. Introducing waiting restrictions on St Michael\u0026rsquos Lane to prevent vehicles from parking and causing obstructions to pedestrians accessing Musselburgh Primary Care Centre  7. Extending the existing no waiting, loading and unloading at the exit of Linkfield Court to improve sightlines and removing a section of no waiting, loading and unloading restriction on the west side to create parking space  8.

Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard MSP last week met East Lothian Labour Party campaigners at Holyrood as they delivered a petition signed by more than 1,000 people to Kevin Stewart MSP.  While Councillor Lachlan Bruce, ward member for Preston, Seton, Gosford was joined by South of Scotland MSP Michelle Ballantyne, both Conservative, as they sent letters to Mr Stewart calling for the same action (see image inset).  The campaign comes after the minister called in a planning application by Inch Cape Offshore Ltd (ICOL) to build a substation \u0026ndash which would bring energy ashore from a planned offshore wind farm \u0026ndash on a large section of the site, which was recently purchased by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower.  That sparked cross-party condemnation from county politicians, who fear it could jeopardise local plans to create jobs and boost the economy on the site.  Mr Leonard added his signature to the Hands Off Cockenzie petition before it was submitted.  Iain Gray (Lab), East Lothian MSP said: \u0026ldquoMinisters claim the call-in is because the site is of national importance, but even the leader of the SNP Group on East Lothian Council has condemned the decision as unnecessary.  \u0026ldquoBy signing our petition in such large numbers, local people have sent a clear message they want East Lothian to decide on decisions about the future of the site.  Meanwhile, Mr Bruce said he had asked Mr Stewart to send the decision back to the council. He said: \u0026ldquoI think it is only right that this decision is made locally by the council on behalf of local residents. The people who are affected most are local residents and it is the people they elected, not a Government minister from Aberdeen, who should be making the decision.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe reporter will ensure that the local development plan and the community\u0026rsquos views are taken into account prior to making a recommendation to ministers, who will make the final decision."},{"url":null,"title":"IN PICTURES  Cockenzie and Port Seton Gala 2018","story":"              IT WAS a brilliant gala day in Cockenzie and Port Seton today.

Painted on a 60ft by 40ft wall overlooking the city\u0027s Clutha bar, it features a portrait of Mackintosh looking through a stained-glass window.  The street art was commissioned by Radisson RED and designed and created by Art Pistol Projects and well-known Glasgow street artist Rogue-one as a gift to the city.  As part of the project, Radisson RED has donated \u0026pound1,000 to The Clutha Trust, the charity set up after 10 people died when a police helicopter crashed onto the roof of the pub in November 2013.  Michael Weston, curator at Radisson RED hotel in Glasgow, said: \"After opening our doors in April, we wanted to give something that showed our commitment to the local art scene as well as the city of Glasgow itself.  \"It was important to us that the mural represented a key piece of Glasgow\u0027s history, so commissioning a mural of one of the city\u0027s most iconic artists, Charles Rennie Mackintosh, was perfect.  \"It is a fitting tribute to one of Glasgow\u0027s greatest talents in his 150th anniversary year - and I\u0027d encourage everyone to come see it.\"  Born on June 7 1868, Mackintosh trained as an architect and went on to create much-admired buildings including the Glasgow School of Art and Scotland Street School in Glasgow.  The mural was given the go-ahead following a planning row after an objection from a neighbouring business.  Alan Crossan, owner of the Clutha bar, said: \"This mural is a fantastic piece of artwork and a fantastic donation to the Clutha Trust.\"  Bobby McNamara, known as Rogue-one, is renowned for his photo-realistic style and is behind a number of artworks in Glasgow, including Mitchell Street\u0027s floating taxi.  Mr McNamara said: \"From the original design sketch to the completion of the mural, it\u0027s been hard work but of course great fun.  \"Using scaffolding to access the wall was awkward at times as it\u0027s hard to see what you\u0027re doing, but I pushed on utilising my skills and experience. In the end I think I achieved something special.\"  Ali Smith, founder of Art Pistol Projects, said: \"Mackintosh is a bit of a global superstar so we had to get this one right.  \"Stepping away from the wall now it really feels like a special one, a just portrayal of such an iconic and well-loved figure.  \"Everyone that\u0027s been involved deserves a big thanks.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Parents and teachers blamed for  obsession  with university education","story":"              PARENTS and teachers pressurise pupils to go to university without knowing whether it is the best option for them, a leading industrialist has claimed.  Sir Ian Wood, the former Wood Group chief executive and philanthropist, said the pervasive culture that higher education was \"the be all and end all\" was damaging to the large proportion of pupils who were not academically minded.  And he called for a greater focus on the importance of vocational qualifications - as well as a campaign to highlight successful and lucrative careers outside the traditional professions.  Sir Ian was giving evidence to the Scottish Parliament\u0027s education committee, which is looking at the options available to pupils when they leave school.  He said: \"There is a real cultural thing about university being the be all and end all and therefore anything that is not university frankly tends to get secondary consideration. Parents are at fault, teachers are at fault, some schools are at fault.  \"We are trying to change a long embedded view that somehow the really worthwhile thing in life is to go to university and so many parents have got that as the aspiration for the youngster.  \"Parents are the root of the problem, but teachers are the next stage up because a lot of teachers believe that their success is based on how many Highers their children get.\"  Sir Ian told the committee apprenticeships and trades occupations should be made more respectable and highlighted the fact many pupils who had a technical education earned higher salaries than those who went to university.  He added: \"Because of the culture issue a lot of people go to university because their parents want them to go to university ... but they come out and they are still not sure what they want to do and the qualification hasn\u0027t really helped them an awful lot.\"  Joanna Murphy, chairwoman of the National Parent Forum of Scotland, said pupils could be \"negatively influenced\" by parents, but this was often due to a lack of understanding of the alternative opportunities.  She said: \"Although career opportunities are being highlighted more frequently in schools, particularly the promotion of apprenticeships, this tends to be focused in fifth and sixth year which is far too late for parents.\"  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent body Connect Scotland, said many parents got the message \"loud and clear\" from schools that university was the desirable next step.  She said: \"Since it is well recognised that most parents receive their information about education from their child\u0026rsquos school we can\u0026rsquot be surprised at the result.  \"Parents tell us that they feel they receive little information about diverse routes both in and after school, and they often feel frustrated that their child is being ignored in a system which focusses on higher education if their child is not academically minded.  \"Some parents have a clear vision of what they want for their child based on their experience and often family tradition and it is up to schools to help families and young people see the value of wider approaches.\"  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, said it was not teachers, but the Scottish Government and schools quango Education Scotland who \"obsessed\" about the number of Higher passes. And he also argued business had \"raised the stakes\" by making more jobs degree level entry only.  He said: \"I think teachers will bridle at his dismissal of their efforts to encourage vocational pathways. We have been arguing constantly that senior school has been overly focused on qualifications for the past four years.\"  A spokesman for Universities Scotland said: \"We have been absolutely clear that we need to a conversation about getting parents and schools to recognise that the best outcome for young people is the outcome that allows the young person to fulfil their potential.  \"We are also clear that for many people university is the right option for them later in life and we need diverse routes to success for diverse individuals.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Glasgow  is clogged with roads  traffic and pollution ","story":"              It is universally known as the Dear Green Place due to the number of parks and open spaces where the residents could enjoy some leisure time.  But a new report has revealed that Glasgow has more space given up to roads than any other major UK city and is suffering amongst the worst congestion as a result.  The report claims the city is in danger  of being strangled by too many roads clogged with slow-moving vehicles, choked by high levels of pollution and bereft of  city-centre residents.  As a result, it warns Glasgow is in danger of sliding behind rival cities in its ability to compete for jobs, investment and visitors.  Early findings from the Glasgow Connectivity Commission says there is a need to drastically \u0026ldquorewire the city\u0026rsquos transport system which sees city-centre buses crawl at an average of just 4.5mph and fails to meet the needs of destinations such as Glasgow Airport and Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.  The report, which has been looking at how to support economic growth by enabling more people to live, work and visit the city, claims Glasgow is already straggling behind its rivals with too many commuters travelling from the suburbs adding to congestion and pollution, and too few people living in the city\u0026rsquos centre.  It warns other cities which have boosted the number of inner city residents had gone on to see economic investment and jobs increase. A key problem, according to the report, is Glasgow\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquogrid system layout which it says hands significantly more space over to roads than other UK cities, despite it having one of the lowest car ownership levels.  Some 25 per cent of land in the city centre is covered by roads, while pavements take up just eight per cent.  In Edinburgh, however, there is a more equal balance, with roads using just 12% of space, while pavements have 10%.  The commission\u0026rsquos report also points to a rise in goods vehicles \u0026ndash such as home delivery services \u0026ndash and private-hire taxis which could be adding to congestion problems.  The independent commission was established by Glasgow Council leader Susan Aitken with a remit to rethink the city centre as a business, retail and leisure destination.  It is spearheaded by former government transport adviser Professor David Begg.  He said: \u0026ldquoA generation ago Glasgow  led the way across the UK towards  what was seen as a modernised transport system built for the car.  \u0026ldquoNow, with rapidly changing demands and a trend towards low-carbon infrastructure, the priorities of people have changed quite dramatically.  \u0026ldquoThe dominance of the road is being questioned not only in social terms  with its negative impact on air quality and road safety, but also economically as its rival European cities transform their environments in favour of pedestrians, cyclists and integrated public transport.  It pointed to a dramatic decline in bus use which has seen passenger numbers slump by 40% in the past decade. In the past four years, First Bus has lost 27 million passengers \u0026ndash a markedly worse decline than any other UK city.  Despite the introduction of cycle lanes and better walkways, evidence to the commission from SPT had shown  journeys by bike had increased by 3%  in the decade to 2016, and the proportion of journeys on foot had fallen from  15% to 11%.  The findings pointed to research that showed large increases in city-centre employment in Manchester and Leeds occurring at the same time as a population boom. Many new residents were young professionals attracted by job prospects and amenities.  Ms Aitken said: \u0026ldquoDavid Begg\u0026rsquos expertise and knowledge speaks for itself. I gave him and his commissioners a very broad remit \u0026ndash linked to improving the city centre experience supporting the local economy, and ensuring all of Glasgow\u0026rsquos people can share in the prosperity it creates.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom pleased to see them really take that challenge on and it is clear the commission has already gathered some very significant and sometimes uncomfortable evidence.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom not going to try to second-guess what their final recommendations are going to be, but I\u0026rsquom convinced they will present a healthy challenge to the city and to members of all parties on the council.  The commission will produce its final report and recommendations in November."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7922625.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Get into the summer spirit with these great Scottish gins","story":"              SCOTLAND\u0027S\u0026nbsplove of gin continues to evolve in new and interesting ways.

The still was made locally in Elgin by highly skilled craftsmen who carefully shaped copper sheets into a traditional 250l copper still making the micro-distillery one of the smallest in the region.    Gin enthusiasts will be given a rare insight into this Elgin based distillery as they open their doors with an upcoming special two day event.

Avva Scottish Gin was launched in 2016, with strong links to surrounding Elgin. The ethos behind the company is history, provenance and family, made evident through the personal details all intrinsically linked to the name, the design, the still, botanical selection, the Speyside region and the distillers\u0026rsquo family.    Jill Brown, the founder and owner of Moray Distillery, said: \u0026ldquoThe distillery is not normally open to the public, so we\u0026rsquore excited to host another open day. It\u0026rsquos a great activity for people to experience around the area, and something a little different, especially for anyone looking to have a day out and explore Elgin.  \u0026ldquoIt was important for us to create a product with links to our history and culture. Our still is called Jessie Jean- named after both my grandmothers, and Avva actually means respected grandmother. The \u0026lsquorose window\u0026rsquo design on each bottle was created to represent what it was thought the Elgin Cathedral window looked like.  \u0026ldquoThe feedback we\u0026rsquove had since the launch has been immense\u0026hellip I\u0026rsquom really proud of our gin.

As trains pass overhead on their way south from Glasgow Central station, Darran is busy distilling Illicit Gin using traditional methods. Botanicals infuse in a\u0026nbsp copper pot still over a naked flame, the process is truly small batch and each bottle is hand-filled and labelled on site.    With their first product launching in April this year Illicit Gin aims to take gin back to its roots, the way gin should be \u0026ndash with juniper firmly at the forefront. Other botanicals including liquorice, clove, cinnamon and nutmeg \u0026ndash which contribute a sweet, earthy flavour \u0026ndash along with perfumed notes from the likes of cardamom and orange and lemon peels provide citrus freshness.  The short, squat nature of the still used at Illicit Spirits helps produce spirits which are full-bodied, flavourful in character, and rich in texture. A spirit of this kind deserves to be enjoyed simply, neat over ice, or served with a premium tonic, slice of orange peel and a bruised cardamom pod.    \u0026nbspIllicit Gin is currently stocked in a small selection of independent bars and off-licences throughout Glasgow and beyond, and will be moving into UK-wide distribution later in the year.  en-gb.facebook/illicitspiritsco  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Isle of Skye Distillers  Isle of Skye Distillers\u0026rsquo story began in 2016, when brothers Alistair and Thomas Wilson combined their experience in the hospitality and construction industries and completed their vision: to build the first gin distillery on the Isle of Skye.    At Isle of Skye Distillers, provenance is everything. The distillery is proud to use locally foraged juniper berries and clear spring water from the Storr Lochs to create their small-batch spirits: Misty Isle Gin, and Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin, both infused with a true taste of Skye. Every part of the production process is carried out at the distillery in Portree, right down to hand-numbering and signing each bottle.  Alongside these locally grown juniper berries, Misty Isle Gin is distilled with a precise balance of botanicals, including coriander, grains of paradise, orris root, liquorice root, black cubebs, angelica root, lemon peel, lemon verbena, cassia bark, and another secret ingredient, which can only be found at high altitude on the Isle of Skye. Still crafted according to the original recipe first developed by Thomas and Alistair during the distillery\u0026rsquos creation, Misty Isle Gin is juniper-heavy with earthy undertones, a hint of spice, and best enjoyed with a Scottish tonic water and a twist of orange peel.  Distilled alongside Misty Isle Gin is Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin, which was created in memory of Alistair and Thomas\u0026rsquo late father, Tommy Wilson, who served in the Suez invasion. \u0026lsquoTommy\u0026rsquo is also a generic name and term of endearment for a soldier. For every bottle of Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin sold, a donation is made to local military charities.    Crafted with botanicals including poppy seed, coriander, liquorice root, blaeberry and sweet orange, Tommy\u0026rsquos Gin is best served with fresh Scottish blaeberries and garnished with a twist of lemon peel.

In the work they do (and have done!), Dale and Vicky have always focused on creating the purest, best possible standard of end product. The precision of an engineer and the taste of perfection from a master baker and chef made the perfect blend for the development of this award winning gin brand.    McQueen Gin is a true craft spirit gin brand, which shares Dale and Vicky\u0026rsquos taste of adventure. They are fulfilling their dream by creating a product made using the purest and most authentic of methods and sharing it with the increasing population of gin lovers. The McQueen gins are infused with natural notes of hand-selected botanicals during distillation, with no flavour elements added after it leaves their much-loved still named \u0026lsquoLittle Maggie\u0026rsquo. This trademark distillation method means that each unique flavour is pure and perfectly balanced, allowing the adventurous gin drinker an experience that is absolutely unrivalled.    Based at their much-loved distillery in Callander, Scotland they introduced true craft spirits with flavour profiles such as smokey chilli, mocha, mint chocolate and sweet citrus, with something for every occasion and flavour profiles that true craft gin drinkers can\u0026rsquot wait to try. The strong belief in their philosophy of bringing customers a taste of adventure and discovery, married with their unique distillation method, is what makes the product so unique. Craft gin drinkers increasingly want provenance and true hand-crafted products, something McQueen ensures.

At McQueen Gin, they continue to explore new innovative methods to ensure that their pure and exciting products deliver on all levels. This includes the imminent introduction of a stylish new glass version of their award-winning ceramic bottle and the build of a new and improved distillery on their land in Callander, which has recently got underway.

Each of our spirits is characterised by our use of locally grown botanicals, including a variety of Norse Angelica brought to the islands by seafarers centuries ago. We grow these botanicals in partnership with the Orkney Agronomy Institute in Kirkwall, ensuring consistent quality throughout the harvest.  If you\u0026rsquove not already experienced our gins, please allow us to share the highlights.  Firstly, we have our acclaimed Norse inspired signature gin, Kirkjuvagr, evoking the freshness of the Orkney seas and the purity of our island environment.  For the bold, we offer a 57% ABV, Storm Strength Arkh-Angell gin, which adds new depths to the renowned flavour profile of its elder spirit.

One of the few craft distilleries to be awarded brown sign status, it has been publicly recognised as a star-rated destination on the Scottish tourist map.  The stables-turned-distillery \u0026ndash which was voted Most Promising New Business at the Perthshire Chamber of Commerce Star Awards \u0026ndash is where Persie gin is hand-crafted in small batches. There are three richly aromatic expressions: Zesty Citrus Herby and Sweet \u0026amp Nutty Old Tom.    The three expressions were developed by the man behind Scotland\u0026rsquos first touring gin enterprise. Founded in 2013, Gin Club Scotland was launched with the sole purpose of hearing the voice of the customer and using these insights to make a home-grown Scottish gin that hit the spot. It worked like a charm: in under a year, Simon Fairclough had visited every Scottish region and heard from over 2,000 gin-lovers about what appealed to their taste buds, pocket and sense of style. He harvested this feedback and found out two things. Firstly, for cracking gin, you need more than a nice taste: you need aroma. With over 75% of flavour down to smell, the perfect interplay of aroma and taste is the single biggest influence among Scots for liking each gin. And, secondly, three profiles proved most popular at tastings by a wide margin \u0026ndash fruity, savoury and sweet.    The result is that Persie Gin taps right into that \u0026ndash with a family of three distinct styles of aromatic gin. Each gin is made with carefully chosen botanicals to evoke an emotive and comforting scent: Zesty Citrus is sharply fruity, chock-full of limes and oranges Herby \u0026amp Aromatic is dry and savoury, with fragrant rosemary and basil and Sweet \u0026amp Nutty is full-bodied and creamy,\u0026nbspwith fresh\u0026nbspvanilla pods, almonds and a hint of root ginger.  All three gins scooped awards in the first year of trading. Zesty Citrus was voted Best Gin in Scotland Under \u0026pound35 by Scottish Field magazine Herby \u0026amp Aromatic was awarded a Silver Outstanding for Gin \u0026amp Tonic by the International Wine \u0026amp Spirits Competition and Sweet \u0026amp Nutty Old Tom was awarded a Silver Medal in the Speciality Gin category at the Scottish Gin Awards.  The distillery is open to the public for drop-ins, tours and tastings.  www.persiedistillery  snifter@persiedistillery  @persiegin  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Porter\u0027s Gin  Founders Ben, Josh and Alex turned the basement of their award winning Aberdeen cocktail bar, Orchid, into a micro-distillery. They focus on modern gin recipes that pay respect to tradition.\u0026nbsp      The result is a modern classic gin with a punchy juniper and a unique citrus flavour profile. The fresh, light and clean flavour from the cold-distilled botanicals make this a perfect gin for long refreshing summer drinks.

The expansive ocean surrounding the beautiful Isle of Barra has inspired the island-born couple\u0026rsquos adventure into the world of distilling.    With many goals set for the future of the Isle of Barra Distillers, it is the deep sense of duty that drives the team on. With a firm belief of giving something back to the community and at the same time building something that will one day outlive anyone that walks through the doors.  Michael feels that \u0026ldquoabove everything else that we can achieve from this journey, it is the thought of both giving something back to this beautiful island and also putting the Isle of Barra on the \u0026lsquogin map\u0026rsquo that drives us forward. We feel we owe it to the island and its people - we have the opportunity to do something great and something great is what we are going to do.    The key botanical in Barra gin is sourced naturally from the crystal clear, pure shallows that surround the remotre isle of Barra.  Every piece of edible carrageen seaweed is meticulously selected and handpicked by us on Barra\u0027s beautiful beaches to provide the distinctive flavour of our unique gin.  The carrageen, also known by its scientific name Chondrus Crispus, is a species of red algae native to the cool Atlantic waters skirting Europe\u0026rsquos rocky coastlines, including our beautiful Isle of Barra. Like many of the other seaweed varieties found on the Scottish coast, carrageen is harvested after the spring tides, when the water is furthest from the shore.  It\u0026rsquos this passion and belief that must surely make the story of the Isle of Barra Distillers one to remember.  www.isleofbarradistillers\u0026nbsp  www.facebook/barradistillers  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Teasmith Gin  The Teasmith Gin creators Nick and Emma Smalley have created something truly special - the first Scottish Gin distilled with hand-picked tea. \u0026nbspWhy? Because Scotland has many historical links with the tea trade with several stemming from Aberdeenshire which is where the Founders are based. \u0026nbsp    When they discovered the story of James Taylor \u0026ndash a young man from the area - who grew the very first commercial tea plantation in British Ceylon, they worked with tea consultant Beverly Wainwright to source a special loose leaf tea from the Amba Estate in Sri Lanka.\u0026nbsp It is both hand-picked and hand-rolled \u0026ndash much in the same way Taylor produced his first batches 150 years ago on the island. \u0026nbsp  When distilled, the tea provides fabulous citrus notes of blood orange along with a minty sweetness. \u0026nbspThese flavours are paired with more classic gin botanicals such as juniper, coriander seed, dried orange peel, angelica and orris root and a sprinkle of rose petals to create a smooth and fresh juniper-led gin with a citrusy lingering sweetness\u0026nbsp  Finalists in three categories at the 2017 Scottish Gin Awards and racking up 5 awards for brand design already, this gin doesn\u0026rsquot disappoint. A truly smooth gin packaged in a beautifully simple bottle with lots of hidden hand-finishes \u0026ndash it ticks all the boxes.    Serve this gin with copious ice, a premium quality tonic and sprig of fresh mint for a truly crisp and refreshing G\u0026ampT. \u0026nbspOr as a cocktail suggestion, The Teasmith Southside is a really simple drink that you can make at home.  The Teasmith Gin is available through The Teasmith Gin\u0026rsquos website for \u0026pound38.95 or through the Master of Malt. \u0026nbspAvailable in store at Valhalla\u0026rsquos Goat (Glasgow) and The Gin Company (Edinburgh) and many other stockists listed on their website.

You get jaded. You get cynical. You get used to being hosed in nonsense for 45 minutes each week. And then along comes a moment so unexpected it reminds you it\u0026rsquos not like that at all. It\u0026rsquos actually so much worse.  There was a sombre start, with a minute\u0026rsquos silence in memory of Grenfell. Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh then nodded to the VIP gallery to welcome the latest visiting hardman.  \u0026ldquoAndriy Parubiy, Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada, the Parliament of the Ukraine, he said.  MSPs looked up cursorily at the delegation in headphones next to the translator\u0026rsquos box.  Tory leader Ruth Davidson started moaning ritually about lags with tags. The SNP was planning \u0026ldquoto release more criminals back into communities, she said, and didn\u0026rsquot care if the blighters cut off their curfew anklets.  \u0026ldquoI certainly hope that the parliamentary authorities allow more than 15 minutes debate for those important issues, she quipped.  So far, so standard. The next 40 minutes stretched agonisingly over the horizon.  And then Richard Leonard showed us just what he\u0026rsquos made of. It was extraordinary. It was a revelation. It was truly the Scottish Labour leader at the peak of his powers  \u0026ldquoCan the First Minister give us another word for a hummingbird\u0026rsquos beak? he asked.  Now, you\u0026rsquore probably thinking I just made that up. But no. I\u0026rsquom a journalist not a surrealist.  \u0026ldquoEh, not immediately, no, replied the First Minister warily, groping for the security alarm under her desk.  The chamber fell silent. The tension crackled. The Ukrainian delegation stirred nervously. Hearts went out to the bloke in the translator\u0026rsquos box tasked with conveying that one to the Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada.  \u0026lsquoComrade Sturgeon, please to describe the mouth of a tiny chicken,\u0026rsquo he whimpered.  Mr Leonard said the FM\u0026rsquos reply was \u0026ldquounfortunate as the fabled \u0026ldquohummingbird\u0026rsquos beak question was one of the government\u0026rsquos standardised test posers for five-year-olds.  \u0026ldquoLittle wonder that Scotland\u0026rsquos teachers have told me how young and confident children are crushed by these tests, he said, miming the crushing of a five-year-old in a car compactor.  \u0026ldquoThere have been reports of children being driven to tears! he went on. \u0026ldquoTears!  One educational charity had even likened the tests to a traumatic \u0026ldquoadverse childhood experience, he said, conjuring up the image of a hummingbird silhouette slashing at a shower curtain with its hooter.  \u0026ldquoI don\u0026rsquot know what Richard Leonard was doing yesterday, sneered Ms Sturgeon in a tone strongly suggesting she thought it involved concussion.  \u0026ldquoBut I talked to a range of primary school children, including some five-year-olds. I did not meet any who were in tears or see any who looked crushed. I saw confident, bright and enthusiastic young people.  Beaky Leonard reckoned that sounded thoroughly improbable. Standardised tests were flawed and had to stop, he said.  \u0026ldquoFM, will you stop standardised testing for five-year-olds now and put pupils first?  Ms Sturgeon said she would always listen to feedback from teachers - but not Labour.  As for the answer to Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos question? He managed to cock even that up.  It later emerged the test is actually a multiple choice that runs: \u0026ldquoThe hummingbird has a thin beak. What is another word for beak?  Kids, crushed and otherwise, are then asked to choose between skin, bill and body.  Mr Leonard\u0026rsquos choices, meanwhile, appear destined to stay ridicule, failure and obscurity."},{"url":null,"title":"Thousands join SNP after party  39 s dramatic Westminster walk-out","story":"              THOUSANDS of new members have signed up to the SNP in the wake of the party\u0026rsquos dramatic Westminster walk-out.  Nationalist MPs stormed out of the Commons after their Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, was ordered to leave the chamber following a row with the Speaker.  Since then, the SNP said its membership has surged by 5,085 in just 24 hours \u0026ndash putting it on the cusp of being the second largest party in the UK, ahead of the Conservatives.  Deputy leader Keith Brown said the SNP was \u0026ldquothe only party standing up for Scotland and doing all we can to defend the powers of our Parliament.  Mr Blackford was ordered to leave during Prime Minister\u0026rsquos Questions after clashing with Commons Speaker John Bercow.  The SNP Westminster leader had accused the UK Government of plunging Scotland into a \u0026ldquoconstitutional crisis over its decision to push on with its Brexit Bill despite Holyrood withholding consent.  He attempted to use a parliamentary device by calling for an immediate vote on turning PMQs into a private session. But after repeatedly refusing to sit down, Mr Blackford was ordered to leave the Commons \u0026ndash with the rest of his party\u0026rsquos MPs quickly following suit.  Mr Brown said: \u0026ldquoThe Tories think they can do what they want to Scotland and get away with it, but Scotland has told the Tories loudly and clearly \u0026ndash hands off our parliament.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos no wonder people are joining the SNP in their droves \u0026ndash we are the only party standing up for Scotland and doing all we can to defend the powers of our Parliament. That is why 5,085 people have joined the party in the last 24 hours.  \u0026ldquoAs the SNP made clear at PMQs yesterday, this Tory power grab will not be tolerated and we will fight tooth and nail to defend the powers that are rightly held by Holyrood.  It is understood around 50-100 normally join or rejoin the SNP on any given day.  It comes as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon warned the Tories will pay \"a very, very heavy political price\" for their handling of the Brexit Bill.  Ms Sturgeon said Theresa May\u0027s party had effectively \"ripped up\" the convention underpinning devolution, and \"hoped that nobody would notice\".  Speaking at First Minister\u0027s Questions, she said events at Westminster this week were \"the most clear and powerful evidence so far\" that the system does not work for Scotland.  She addressed MSPs shortly after crowds gathered outside Holyrood to protest against what the SNP claims is a \"Westminster power grab\".  The party\u0027s MPs were left outraged on Tuesday evening when amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill affecting Scotland were passed after less than 20 minutes of debate, with the only speech being from Cabinet Office minister David Lidington.  Mr Blackford has warned the SNP will now take \"whatever action is necessary\" to press its case, and will work to \"frustrate\" Theresa May\u0027s administration."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/5072730.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Honeybees deployed to  sniff out  landmines","story":"              THEY are usually found bumbling around from flower to flower, their concerns chiefly revolving around the collecting of pollen and the making of honey.  But now the humble honeybee is being hailed as a potential warzone life-saver after Scottish scientists managed to train them to sniff out landmines.  Researchers at St Andrews University let slip the bees of war in a former Yugoslavian warzone, teaching them to find unexploded ordnance by sniffing out the smell of bombs.  The buzzing insects were released and tracked across what was once a battlefield in Croatia, and then examined when they returned to the hive for tiny traces of explosives.  Once confirmed, footage from drones was used to pinpoint the spot where the bees had been, allowing recover teams to go in and disarm any landmines they found.  READ MORE:\u0026nbspConservationists put out feelers to save Scotland\u0027s bees    Dr Ross Gillander, a research fellow in the department of physics at St Andrews, helped design the equipment which allows the bees to be examined when they come back to their hive.  The project borrows standard Apismellisera Carnica honeybees which are trained over two days by placing sugar syrup on top of some TNT.  \"Basically we teach them by a version of reward like you do with dogs,\" said Dr Gillander.  \"The bees fly out of their hive to go about their normal day to day job of finding pollen but instead of finding pollen they find explosives. It\u0027s the sugar syrup, which draws them out.  \"The training takes two days and is much faster and more efficient than training a dog. However, after three days the bees realise that they aren\u0027t getting reward from the TNT and as a result are disinterested in it and look for other things.  \"After three days we have to re-train the honeybees to detect the explosives.\"  Remarkable video shot from a drone shows how the movement of the mine-hunting bees can be detected by infra red cameras.    READ MORE:\u0026nbspSave our bees - why one Scottish estate is supporting bee keeping and why we should do the same  The footage followed the fluffy pollinators around in the test site, and when the bees stay in the same place, it indicates to researchers they have made a discovery.  Dr Gillander explained this was a first as the flying bugs \"are very small and very fast, which makes them difficult to track\".  Honeybees have an advantage over sniffer dogs when it comes to finding explosives as dogs only work for 15 minutes at a time. Dogs, which are more expensive to train, see it as a \"game\" and quickly get bored.  Bees will work tirelessly and are not affected by the chemical compounds found in explosives. They can get to areas that that are more difficult to get to than dogs.  Dr Gillander, a physicist, designed the equipment that tests the bees for explosives when they return to the hive.  The bees go through a special canvas-type material which is then exposed to light.  \"A drop in light emission (like a light dimmer switch) confirms the presence of explosives,\" said Dr Gillander.  Real-world tests started in Croatia in November last year, funded by NATO Science for Peace and Security, and using bees from local hives.  The types of landmines the insects are being trained to detect are Yugoslavian PMA-2 and PMA-3 mines, along with some Russian or Soviet anti-personnel devices.    READ MORE:\u0026nbspUniversity library in quite a buzz after colony of bees is found in the walls\u0026nbsp  The bees do have drawbacks, however. Rain and darkness will normally deter them from going out on their life-saving missions.  Precise details of the tests are being kept under wraps for now, but Dr Gillander said the use of bees looked \"promising\".  The academic revealed there had so far been just one casualty from the testing - PhD student James Glackin, who was strung three times while driving 6,000 bees to the test site.  The early results of the ongoing trials in Croatia hold out hope that more of the millions of abandoned mines around the world could be cleared up more quickly, sparing thousands of people from being killed or injured.  There are an estimated 110 million land mines lost across the world which kill or injure between 15,000 to 20,000 people annually."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7926358.jpg?type=article-full","title":"Comradeship can never be underestimated","story":"              Scotland\u0026rsquos largest membership charity for veterans is seeking more volunteers to help tackle isolation and loneliness among the Armed Forces community.

One teacher in Edinburgh said they had spent around 70 hours administering the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos standardised tests on their school\u0026rsquos 54 primary one pupils.  It comes as ministers came under increasing pressure to scrap the assessments amid claims some children have been reduced to tears.  In an email sent to Scottish Labour MSP Iain Gray, the Edinburgh primary teacher said they had overseen 30 hours of testing for numeracy and 40 for literacy.  They added: \u0026ldquoThe amount of progress that could have been delivered if those hours were used for effective teaching is significant and instead we were required to use that time to run testing which\u0026hellipis problematic in almost every regard.  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon introduced the new tests last year as a response to concerns over falling standards of literacy and numeracy and a lack of consistent data across the country.  But critics insist testing pupils in the first year of primary \u0026ndash as well as in P4, P7 and S3 \u0026ndash piles too much pressure on children and teachers.  Raising the issue at First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said teachers had told him that young, confident children had been \u0026ldquocrushed by the assessments.  Calling for them to be scrapped, he said: \u0026ldquoAt SNP conference John Swinney claimed that we are seeing the start of a renaissance in Scottish education. This \u0026lsquorenaissance\u0026rsquo is driving primary school children to tears.  \u0026ldquoThese tests have been flawed from the very start. Delivered late, \u0026pound2 million over budget and have led to weeks of valuable teaching time lost.  In their email, the Edinburgh teacher \u0026ndash whose identity has been kept anonymous to protect their job \u0026ndash also raised a number of issues with the design and wording of the tests.  They wrote: \u0026ldquoMany of the questions in the tests are very poorly phrased \u0026ndash often at best they are ambiguous and at worst they are so badly written that they are actually misleading.  In one example, children were presented with the problem: \u0026ldquoJane had six grapes on her plate, she ate three of them, choose Jane\u0026rsquos plate.  The teacher said the phrasing of the question made it unclear whether pupils should choose the half-eaten plate, or the original.  They also noted that out of the 54 pupils tested, \u0026ldquonot one child came out as low on the numeracy test, even though some of them only gave a handful of correct answers.  They added: \u0026ldquoThe only conclusion I can reach having watched this process from beginning to end is that these tests have been set up to give a deliberately vague picture which broadly supports the idea that the attainment gap is closing.  \u0026ldquoI cannot use the data from these tests to support my teaching in any way. It does not provide reliable information on any aspect of my children\u0026rsquos learning or development.  Larry Flanagan, general secretary of the EIS teaching union, said many of the concerns raised by the teacher had also been brought up by other members.  He said primary teachers faced a logistical challenge as they administered the tests, which require pupils to have access to computers.

The First Minister was quizzed by Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who called on her to \"show victims their rights come before criminals for once\".  Ms Davidson said proposals contained in the new Management of Offenders Bill meant it would not be an immediate offence for a criminal to cut off their tag if they have been released on home detention curfew.  She said: \"The First Minister is proposing to release more criminals back to communities, and under those plans a serious offender could be released from prison, could be given a tag, cut it off, breach the terms of their release and incredibly that wouldn\u0027t automatically be considered an offence.  It comes a week after Ms Davidson called for the new legislation to be put on hold after father-of-three Craig McLelland was stabbed to death by James Wright while he was \"unlawfully at large\".  Responding during First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions, Ms Sturgeon pledged the Scottish Government would \"properly consider any amendment\" to the Bill, which is currently going through Holyrood.

One pro-EU Conservative branded the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos strategy \"sneaky\" while another claimed the wording of a new UK Government amendment was changed to deny MPs the chance of blocking a \"no-deal\" Brexit and sending UK ministers back to the negotiating table should Westminster reject the final agreement.  Earlier this week, Mrs May avoided an almost certain Commons defeat by inviting potential rebels into her private office and assuring them that their concerns about having a \"meaningful vote\" on the final Brexit deal would be addressed.  Yet the PM\u0026rsquos new amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill, tabled Thursday evening, leaves Parliament facing a stark \"deal or no deal\" choice.  It says if MPs rejected the final agreement, then Parliament would be offered the opportunity only to vote on a \"neutral motion,\" saying MPs had considered a minister\u0027s statement on the matter.  Crucially, this motion would be unamendable, so MPs could not order Mrs May to go back to the negotiating table, extend the Brexit transition or revoke the UK\u0027s withdrawal under Article 50.  Leading pro-EU Conservative Dominic Grieve said he believed, after a very sensible negotiation with the PM, there had been an agreement, but \u0026ldquoat the last moment part of the text was changed to make the final motion unamendable\u0026hellipIt is unacceptable.  Mr Grieve tabled his own amendment, enabling MPs to dictate the next steps the Government should take in the event of a no deal.  It has now been re-tabled in the Lords, setting the scene for a fresh Government defeat when the Bill returns there on Monday another Commons showdown will occur when it goes back before MPs on Wednesday.  Labour\u0026rsquos Keir Starmer said: \"Theresa May has gone back on her word and offered an amendment that takes the meaning out of the meaningful vote. Parliament cannot - and should not - accept it.\"  Tom Brake for the Liberal Democrats said the PM had been \u0026ldquocaught red-handed making conflicting offers. \u0026ldquoWe are now finding out which lie she was telling.

Taking a leaf out of the Irish Parliamentary Party\u0026rsquos book could mean Scottish Nationalist MPs making lengthy speeches, creating innumerable amendments to bills and calling for unnecessary votes tactics designed to \u0026ldquogum up the Westminster system.  In Commons exchanges, SNP MP Stewart McDonald invoked the spirit of Mr Parnell, who led the campaign for Irish Home Rule in the 1880s his bronze bust sits outside party leader Ian Blackford\u0026rsquos Commons office.  Mr McDonald told MPs: \u0026ldquoParnell, of course, along with his colleagues at the time, successfully used the standing orders of the House to frustrate Government business - which is an entirely legitimate tactic - to force them to take Irish issues seriously, including in a 45-hour sitting on the 1877 South Africa Bill.  \u0026ldquoGiven the way that Ireland has this Government over a barrel at the minute, it might just be that those tactics are of interest to honourable members at the present time, said the Glasgow South MP.  In his Herald column today, Kenny Macaskill, the former Scottish Government Justice Secretary, says that Parnell\u0026rsquos Irish Parliamentary Party should now be the \u0026ldquomodel for the SNP at Westminster.  \u0026ldquoUnder the great Charles Stewart Parnell they flourished in the chamber when it suited them but never forgot that their purpose was to leave it, he explains, adding: \u0026ldquoHopefully, that will now be the template for the modern SNP\u0026hellip  Asked about the Nationalist leadership\u0026rsquos threat to frustrate Government business in the Commons, Theresa May\u0026rsquos spokesman stressed how UK ministers had sought to \u0026ldquowork constructively with the Scottish Government and the SNP leadership throughout the Brexit process and would continue to do so.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a matter for the SNP what they choose to do in Parliament.  As reported by The Herald yesterday, the constitutional row over the EU Withdrawal Bill and Holyrood withholding consent looks set to be repeated this autumn over the Government\u0026rsquos Trade Bill as Edinburgh has similar \u0026ldquopower-grab concerns about it.  This means when Whitehall seeks the consent of MSPs on the important legislation, they will almost certainly refuse to give it.  Back in the Commons after his eviction from Prime Minister\u0027s Questions, Mr Blackford claimed the Tory Government had \"totally shafted\" the people of Scotland over Brexit and repeated his call for David Mundell to resign.  The party leader accused the Scottish Secretary of having \"downgraded devolution\" and urged him to apologise for ignoring Holyrood by supporting the Withdrawal Bill.  But Mr Mundell countered by insisting the so-called Sewel Convention was not absolute, explaining how the UK Government would seek consent from Holyrood unless there were \"not normal circumstances applying\". Leaving the EU, he contended, was \u0026ldquonot normal circumstances\".  The Secretary of State claimed the SNP Government had adopted an \u0026ldquounreasonable position from the outset ie \u0026ldquoit would be content with nothing less than a veto on UK matters. This, he said, was unacceptable as it would undermine the integrity of the country\u0027s internal market.  \u0026ldquoWe reached out to Michael Russell to see whether he was willing to engage with that process, explained the Scottish Secretary. \u0026ldquoBut I am afraid the clear message was that the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos position is as it was\u0026hellipand that there is no scope for compromise.  Mr Russell, the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos Brexit Minister, was in Dublin on Thursday, where he insisted the devolved administrations \u0026ldquomust be involved in any future trade negotiations post Brexit something the PM has hitherto set her face against.  *Meanwhile, it has emerged the Commons Speaker has granted a debate on Scotland and Brexit for Monday it is due to coincide with England\u0026rsquos opening World Cup match against Tunisia."},{"url":null,"title":"Auditors slam Government  39 s flagship benefit Universal Credit","story":"              THE Government\u0027s flagship Universal Credit benefit could end up costing more than the benefits system it is replacing, according to a damning report from the National Audit Office (NAO).  The benefit for job-seekers, which incorporates housing costs and five other benefits into one payment, is also taking far longer to roll out than intended.  \"Universal Credit (UC) has not delivered value for money and it is uncertain that it ever will\", the public spending watchdog said.  The Department for Work and Pensions has admitted itself that it cannot measure whether managing the programme but has itself admitted that it cannot measure whether UC is achieving its policy goal of getting an additional 200,000 people into work.  The roll-out was initially intended to be complete by October 2017, but at present only around one in ten of those eventually expected to be on UC are claiming it.  The NAO also queried claims by the department that people were not suffering difficulties and hardship and satisfaction rates among claimants are high.  It said the DWP had not shown sufficient sensitivity towards some claimants and that it does not know how many claimants are having problems with the programme.  Its report concludes that there is no practical alternative to continuing with rollout of UC but said ministers should make sure the programme does not expand before it has learned from insights it has gained from the roll-out so far.  Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said \u0026ldquoThe Department has kept pushing the Universal Credit rollout forward through a series of problems. We recognise both its determination and commitment, and that there is really no practical choice but to keep on keeping on with the rollout.  \u0026ldquoWe don\u0026rsquot think DWP has shown the same commitment to listening and responding to the hardship faced by claimants.  \"We think the larger claims for Universal Credit, such as boosted employment, are unlikely to be demonstrable at any point in future. Nor for that matter will value for money.  Critics of the Government\u0027s Universal Credit have seized the report to call for changes to the flagship benefit.  Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: \"While Universal Credit is working well for some, more than a quarter of a million people are expected to wait longer than five weeks for their first full payment. This puts them at risk of falling behind on bills and getting into debt - a heavy price to pay for a system that isn\u0027t working properly.\"  Alison Garnham, the chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said: \"The picture the NAO presents is justifiably bleak.  \"On the ground, new claimants can\u0027t even be sure they will be paid in full and on time, and how many people will be helped into work by the benefit is far from clear.\"  Margaret Greenwood, shadow DWP secretary, said: \"The Government has shamelessly ignored warning after warning about the devastating impact their flagship welfare reform has had on people\u0027s lives.\""},{"url":null,"title":"Ian McConnell  Britain seems like such a funny little country when the Brexiters bluster","story":"              BRITAIN sometimes seems like a funny little country these days.  True, it still ranks as one of the world\u0026rsquos big economies. But Chancellor Philip Hammond conceded in November that it had fallen from fifth to sixth-biggest, having been overtaken by France. And the UK\u0026rsquos own woeful performance and policy errors, and the rise of other countries, such as India, look set to ensure the drift down the rankings continues.  It is important to recognise that a country\u0026rsquos standing on the international stage is about much more than just size. It is also about influence, and attitude, and behaviour. Unfortunately for the UK, there is surely no arguing with the assertion that, in the strange days since the Brexit vote, the description of \u0026ldquofunny little could be applied to the mindset of so many Brexiters when it comes to the wider world.  It has been another most curious, though unfortunately no less lamentable, week on the Brexit front.  Read More: Ian McConnell: Taiwan strives for regional cooperation as UK turns back on partners with Brexit  We have had blustering Tory Brexiters in the House of Commons declaim (to summarise) that the people voted for Brexit and they must not be denied it.  In the same week, we have had a further raft of dismal economic figures which show the UK, weighed down by Brexit uncertainty, is in grim shape even before we get to the horrors of the actual breakaway from the huge free-trade bloc.  Yet, we are told, the Brexiters will jolly well have what they voted for. They will not be swayed by the realities of the situation, which they seem to regard as propaganda by people they oh-so-tiresomely refer to as \u0026ldquoRemoaners. Albeit the schoolboyish \u0026ldquoRemoaner jibe is certainly preferable to the \u0026ldquotraitor comments you sometimes hear bandied around when it comes to Brexit. \u0026ldquoTraitor is an extreme word, and its use by some Leave voters underlines the divisive and intolerant nature of Brexit.  Fears over the state of the UK economy intensified this week when official data revealed the sharpest monthly drop in manufacturing output since October 2012. The 1.4 per cent month-on-month plunge will surely be a disappointment to some in the Brexit camp (even if they will not admit it). It highlights not only the domestic economic malaise but also the fact that sterling weakness arising from the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit vote does not appear to have been the catalyst for a lasting export boom.  Read More: Fears over UK economy intensify as manufacturing output plunges  Not than anyone should have expected it to be such a catalyst. After all, you would imagine all the uncertainty around trade arrangements after Blighty quits the European Union would not be trumped by a pricing advantage for UK exporters arising from sterling weakness. Especially given the pound\u0026rsquos troubles have sent UK companies\u0026rsquo import costs rocketing.  Also this week, we have had figures from the Office for National Statistics signalling underlying weakness in the UK construction sector. The data showed construction output rose by just 0.5% in April, having tumbled by 2.3% in March as freezing weather disrupted activity. Economists had forecast construction output would have bounced back by 2% in April.  Meanwhile, trade figures this week from the ONS were dire.  The UK\u0026rsquos global goods trade deficit widened from \u0026pound12 billion in March to \u0026pound14.04bn in April, much worse than the \u0026pound11.35bn forecast by economists, as exports fell sharply and imports rose. The deterioration was driven by a widening of the UK\u0026rsquos deficit on trade in goods with countries outwith the EU, from \u0026pound3.79bn to \u0026pound5.37bn.  Read More: Ian McConnell: Man in Lego boat without paddle sums up Brexit fiasco frustration  Many Brexiters still believe that increased trade with non-EU countries \u0026ndash perceived by the Leave camp to be wildly enthusiastic about doing more business with the mighty UK \u0026ndash will be an economic panacea. The Brexiters\u0026rsquo head-in-the-British-sand attitude has meant the absence of any catalyst for their imagined boom in UK trade with countries outside the EU has not dampened their bizarre enthusiasm.  At the end of the day, Brexit is a fool\u0026rsquos errand driven by ideology and not by considerations of people\u0026rsquos standards of living, which are dictated in large part by economic success or otherwise. Xenophobia and opposition to immigration look to have been key factors in the Brexit vote.  You still hear the Brexiters bang on about the benefits of leaving the EU. These remain entirely elusive but that, it seems, does not matter one whit to the Brexiters. All the while, some of them harp on about the fabulous bounties which Blighty is going to reap from a raft of new free-trade deals. This would be laughable in its ridiculousness if the consequences for the economy and people\u0026rsquos living standards were not so serious.  Read More: Ian McConnell: Fears for economy grow as millions hit by Brexit cost of living crisis  And what about the growing protectionism when it comes to world trade? One of those countries at the forefront of this is the US, which some in the UK Government seem to believe is going to be falling over itself to do one of the fastest-arranged trade deals of modern times with Britain, even though nothing of substance has happened on this front in the two years since the Brexit vote.  Meanwhile, there is no sign that the other countries which the UK Government has had its sights on, in its desperate lobbying mission to try to make Brexit look like a good idea, will be putting Britain ahead of the massive and powerful EU bloc in the queue for trade deals. Why would these countries prioritise foolishly by putting an isolated UK ahead of the huge EU bloc?  And this brings us back to the essence of the problem.  The UK is a sizeable economy. However, its influence is dwindling as other countries rise. Faced with such challenges, being part of a powerful bloc such as the EU has been hugely important.  Many in the Brexit camp seem to believe the UK is the most important country in the world. They need to wake up to the fact the UK Government\u0026rsquos ridiculously over-elevated sense of the country\u0026rsquos importance does not chime at all with the reality of today\u0026rsquos world.  Chance would be a fine thing though. Instead, the Brexiters and their Government at Westminster seem hell-bent on pursuing a dream of making the UK an economic backwater, with a funny little mindset when it comes to the big world out there."},{"url":null,"title":"Fifth of schools not inspected for a decade","story":"              ONE in five Scottish primary and secondary schools has not been inspected for a decade or more raising fears over standards.  New figures show 474 of Scotland\u0026rsquos 2,514 primaries, secondaries and special schools have not been inspected since 2008.  Three were identified as not having been inspected since 2002 - Canna Primary in the Highlands, Sandwick Junior High in Shetland and Back School in the Western Isles.  A decline in the number of inspections over the past few years has already sparked concerns.  Education Scotland, which incorporates the inspectorate, said the drop was partly down to a deliberate move to reduce the burden on schools and target those that need help the most.  Inspectors have also been used in recent years to help schools implement the Curriculum for Excellence with the number of inspections now increasing to 250 a year.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for Scottish Labour, attacked the decline, revealed in a freedom of information request by the Times Educational Supplement Scotland.  He also attacked the decision to merge the former inspectorate with a separate curriculum body to establish Education Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThis government is perfectly prepared to subject five-year-olds to high stakes tests in the name of standards, while letting the established inspection regime wither, he said.  Liz Smith, education spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservative Party, said inspections were \u0026ldquovital.  \u0026ldquoIt cannot be right that pupils can go through all the years of primary or all the years of secondary without their school being inspected, she said.  A spokesman for Education Scotland said inspections were only one aspect of its scrutiny work.  He said: \"Schools are inspected on a proportionate basis, using a sampling approach rather than a cyclical model.  \"When selecting schools for inspection we consider\u0026nbspa range of factors including local circumstances and the length of time since the last inspection.

Our mentoring scheme levels the playing field and gives young people structured, enthusiastic and dedicated support to really find a way to realise and achieve their goals as they make that transition from childhood to their adult lives.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoWe are very proud of what the programme and our young people have achieved to date and we have no doubt the same successes will be realised in the North-east where we have recognised a real need and desire for this support.\u0026lsquoPathways Coordinators\u0026rsquo have been hired for each of the six schools and will begin work after the summer break.

More than 80% of mentored participants have moved onto further education, higher education or employment in sharp contrast to the national figure of 54%.Businessman Iain MacRitchie launched the charity in 2007 after being shocked by a professional experience restructuring a youth care business. While the business health was restored, the poor outcomes for young people remained the same and he realised the need for relationship-based, meaningful support.He commented: \u0026ldquoThat professional experience was a real eye-opener for me, seeing that these young people were not getting the support they needed and nowhere near achieving their potential.

A legal battle is ongoing between the Action Group Company and Manx Capital, the investment vehicle and major claimant that took control of the mass legal claim and secured the settlement on behalf of the claimants..In his letter, Mr Clark said that investigations by a Sunday newspaper had raised serious questions about the credibility of the Action Group Company.He has joined parliamentary colleagues including Kevin Hollinrake, Conservative MP and co-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking in calling for an inquiry.Mr Clark said: \u0026ldquoThis is an issue that was raised with me by a constituent that is directly affected by issues with the settlement agreed with RBS last summer.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoMany RBS shareholders believe that the rights issue undertaken by RBS in 2008 was promoted on a misleading basis.\u0026ldquoThey believe there were serious omissions of information which should have been brought to the attention of investors.\u0026ldquoThe RBS Shareholders Action Group Company was set up in 2009 purportedly to represent the interests of those investors.\u0026ldquoHowever, since the £200million settlement was agreed, a very small fraction of that sum has been paid out.                                                                                                        \u0026ldquoThere are serious concerns about the Action Group Company and the lack of regulation in place to protect shareholders.\u0026ldquoI have now written to the Justice Secretary to join calls for an investigation into the RBS Shareholders Action Group Company, which should happen as a matter of urgency.
