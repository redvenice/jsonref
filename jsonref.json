They diagnosed ten cases each versus typically two and four cases respectively for April and May combined.However, rates in the other three units were similar to previous years. Of the 30 children, 21 were tested for Covid-19 if they had symptoms including fever or cough. Two tested positive. Some children were tested using antibody kits, which have not been widely available to the public.Of the 16 other children given an antibody test, three were positive, suggesting they had previously had the coronavirus.In total, five children tested positive, either for active Covid-19 infection or previous exposure to the virus. A lack of antibody tests meant the other children were not tested for Covid-19, therefore it is not clear whether the true rates of Covid-19 in the children would have been lower or higher than discovered.Rebecca Unsworth, joint first author of the study, said: \u0027During the peak of the pandemic widespread access to testing wasn\u0027t available so we may have missed further cases of Covid-19 in these children who have new-onset type 1 diabetes.\u0027Children are believed to be just as likely as adults to catch the coronavirus. But they may be diagnosed less often because their symptoms are so mild. Testing for Covid-19 in the UK was limited only to adults until mid-May, several weeks after the peak of the pandemic. Children under five years old can now get a test but they would only come forward if they had symptoms. The study, published in Diabetes Care, also found that children in the study had high levels of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). DKA is a serious condition that can happen to diabetics if their body starts to run out of insulin. When this happens, harmful substances called ketones accumulate in the body. It can be life-threatening if it\u0027s not found and treated quickly. Seventy per cent of children had DKA and 52 per cent had severe DKA. Four children were treated in intensive care. The authors cautioned this was a much higher rate than they would normally expect to see, and many children were very unwell.This supports anecdotal stories from doctors in England, according to Julian Hamilton-Shield, a professor of diabetes and metabolic endocrinology at the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the research. The researchers theorised that the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus may be able to attack and destroy insulin-making cells in the pancreas.The spike protein of the virus binds to ACE-2 receptors which coat some cells in the body. Therefore, the receptors are seen as the \u0027gateway\u0027 for the virus.ACE-2 is strongly expressed in pancreatic endocrine cells, the researchers said.  Scientists who were not involved in the study said the link warrants further investigation. Professor Paul Zimmet, at Monash University, and Francesco Rubino, King’s College London, recently expressed their concerns about a potential diabetogenic effect of Covid-19 in the New England Journal of Medicine. They commented today: \u0027The findings add to our concerns on a potential link between Covid-19 and diabetes.\u0027Early in the course of the pandemic we had become aware of similar reports of new cases of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes as well as other atypical diabetes manifestations in people with SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) infection. \u0027This has a biological rationale since the new coronavirus can bind to receptors that are highly prevalent in cells of crucial metabolic organs such as the pancreas, the adipose tissue, the liver and the intestine, which may explain also the fact that both type 1 and type 2 diabetes have been reported in association with Covid-19.\u0027 But Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the rise in paediatric type 1 diabetes could just be random.He said: \u0027It is often tempting but can be wrong to assume that whatever infection is common in the community is the cause of an increase in diagnoses that could have arisen just by chance. \u0027During any epidemic like the current one, people will be looking out for any change in the incidence of disease in their own practice that could be related to the epidemic pathogen.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Major U turn levels GCSEs based teachers assessments","story":"Share this article   The Liberal Democrats have called for Mr Williamson to quit. \u0027The shambolic handling of A-level results has left many young people in crisis,\u0027 Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said. \u0027Despite the warning signs from Scotland, the Education Secretary pushed ahead with plans which ignored teachers\u0027 advice and have disproportionately affected pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.

The pictures captured a whole tennis match in silhouette – serve, return, volley, forehand, backhand – so that the shadows advancing on the court took on a graceful life of their own, tethered to the ankles and feet of young men and women in ankle socks and white plimsolls. The relation of player and shadow – high summer’s constant doubles partners – has become a familiar theme for sports photographers, but Wolff was among the first to celebrate it.In the decade that followed, the German photographer and his assistant-cum-stage manager Alfred Tritschler became famous as “the masters of the Leica”, extending the range and scope of the pioneering hand-held camera, with work showcased in every major magazine and newspaper. The Leica company, which had given the former medical doctor one of its prototype 35mm cameras to experiment with in 1926, subsequently delivered all of its new lenses to Wolff in advance of release for him to create advertising images. A travelling slideshow of some of the results was watched by hundreds of thousands of people across the world.All of Wolff’s technical mastery coincided, of course, with the darkest days in his country’s history. Almost accidentally, he documented in his pin-sharp, perfectly lit way the end of the Weimar republic, the rise of nazism and the devastation of war. Wolff’s house in Frankfurt and his extensive personal archive were destroyed by bombing in 1944. A selection of the prints and negatives that remain has been collected into a book that includes not only his photographs of tennis players, but also early images of Hitler Youth, the launch of the Hindenburg zeppelin and the 1936 Berlin Olympics. Not for nothing is the book called Light and Shadow.

It will open to members this week and to the general public on 1 September.About 40 manuscripts will go on display, dating as far back as the 10th century and ning science, religion, law, music, philosophy, alchemy and Kabbalah. And magic, of which the spellbook is a good example. “It is a charming little manuscript with 125 magic recipes. It is so sweet and has some beautiful decorations.”Among the spells is one “to increase love between bridegroom and bride”, which involves writing their names in honey on to two sage leaves and giving them each other to eat. “I dare anyone to try it,” said Tahan.To catch a thief, simply write the names “Kematin kanit kukairi ve-hikani yazaf” on kosher parchment and hang from the neck of a black rooster. Circle around suspects and the rooster will jump on the head of the thief.To make yourself invisible, burn the skin of a snake in March and sprinkle the ashes in your eyes. People can use those same ashes if you meet a king – simply hold in your hand and they will heed your words.And for a person who has swallowed a bone, the spell reads: “One who swallowed a bone, take a bone of the same kind and place it over his head without his knowledge, then whisper the following: nehash, nehash, har, har, mena’, mena’, tsa, tsa. And it is tested.”Another highlight of the show will be documents shining light on Moses Maimonides, a 12th-century Jewish philosopher who was born in Cordoba, Spain, and went on to become the spiritual leader of the Jewish community in Egypt, where he was physician to the sultan, Saladin. He was the greatest Jewish polymath leader of the middle ages, his name known across Europe.Thousands of Jews wrote to Maimonides asking for advice and legal rulings. The exhibition has a handwritten letter written by him in Arabic, but in Hebrew script, to a teacher who needed specific help.Tahan said the teacher taught two young girls in a remote Jewish community in Egypt. “For some reason, which is not quite clear from the documents – maybe somebody said something derogatory about him – he took an oath to stop teaching the two girls. In those times, when you took an oath, you stuck to it.”But the teacher felt the girls were missing out on an education, so he evidently wrote to Maimonides asking how to go back on the oath. He replied that the teacher needed to get three Israelite witnesses to cancel the oath. “He was always pragmatic. He always thought of how he could help someone and not put them through a very complicated process.”Also on display is the earliest dated (1380) copy of Maimonides’ Guide for the Perplexed, considered to be be his most significant philosophical work.The story of Maimonides also speaks to more harmonious times between Muslim and Jewish communities. “When Maimonides passed away, not only Jewish communities mourned him, but also all the Muslims in the city came to mourn him,” said Tahan. “He was known across Europe and across the three main faiths.”Other highlights include a letter written to Henry VIII by an Italian rabbi in 1530 regarding biblical laws that could support the king’s claim to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.The opening of the Hebrew Manuscripts exhibition is part of the next phase of the British Library’s gradual reopening after lockdown.Also reopening on 1 September is the Treasures gallery, which includes objects ranging from Leonardo da Vinci’s sketchbooks to Andrea Levy’s working drafts for Small Island and The Long Song.• Hebrew Manuscripts 1 September-11 April 2021 at the British Library."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a27271590f18708384f1ee6cb303c3b57f9f109/0_50_3486_2092/master/3486.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0820a3e3bc40ce6c8e49966b748b1870","title":"daigeo to buy ryan reynolds aviation gin in deal of up to 610m","story":"Hollywood star will retain interest in business, where sales doubled in 2019The drinks group Diageo has agreed to buy a gin brand co-owned by the Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds in a deal worth up to $610m (£466m).The FTSE 100 company, which owns Smirnoff vodka and Johnnie Walker whisky, will buy Aviation American Gin and its parent company Davos Brands.Reynolds, the Canadian star of the Deadpool films, bought a stake in Aviation gin in February 2018 and will retain an interest in the business.Diageo said Aviation was the second largest brand in the super-premium gin segment in the US and one of the fastest growing brands in the category.The deal with Diageo includes an initial payment of $335m, and could be worth an additional $275m, depending on the gin’s performance over the next 10 years.Diageo will also acquire the Astral Tequila, Sombra Mezcal and TYKU Sake brands as part of the deal.Ivan Menezes, Diageo’s chief executive, said the acquisition was part of the company’s strategy “to acquire high-growth brands with attractive margins that support premiumisation.“We are confident that Aviation American Gin will continue to shape and drive the growth of super-premium gin in North America,” he said.Reynolds said: “A little over two years ago, I became an owner of Aviation gin because I love the taste of Aviation more than any other spirit.“What I didn’t expect was the sheer creative joy learning a new industry would bring.

Testing will continue until Wednesday to enable all 1,600 employees to be included at an on-site testing station run by the NHS.Bakkavor describes itself as the “leading provider of fresh prepared food in the UK” and supplies major grocery retailers in the country. According to Nottinghamshire county council, 33 of the positive cases have self-isolated and since returned to work “fully fit”.Staff from other parts of the firm will assist with the uploading of data to the NHS portal, and ensure that the completed tests meet allocated courier times.Shona Taylor, business director for desserts at Bakkavor, said: “We understand the importance of the testing and I have been immensely proud of the management team and all the efforts that have been made to ensure we could deliver this for our colleagues. The programme has been positively received, and colleagues have been supportive and reassured that every effort is being taken to ensure their safety.”Jonathan Gribbin, director of public health at Nottinghamshire county council, said: “Bakkavor have been very cooperative and we hope that the testing of their employees will allow us to find out more about where people are acquiring the infection.“However, we know that not all the cases in Newark are linked to Bakkavor, so it is vital that people continue to follow the strict guidance to prevent the transmission of Covid-19 across the whole community. People should follow social distancing guidance in full, including guidelines about car sharing, washing hands regularly, wearing face coverings, self-isolating and quickly getting a test if symptoms develop.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/765f450fe7f860ad16f8ecfee32972eb184e837a/31_152_3930_2358/master/3930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5f155467e3ecdce8c8fa458b4e0dfe42","title":"tata motors denies it plans to sell stake in jaguar land rover","story":"Tata Motors has denied reports it plans to sell its stake in Jaguar Land Rover after a breakdown in talks with the the UK government to secure a financial rescue package.Emergency funding talks with the UK’s biggest carmaker and Tata Steel, which runs the country’s largest steelworks in Port Talbot, Wales – both owned by the Indian conglomerate Tata Group – recently ended with the UK government deciding both companies needed to rely on private financing to survive.Following the conclusion of the talks, which ended after the Treasury deemed that Tata Group had the financial strength to not need a taxpayer bailout, reports emerged that it might sell its stake in the struggling carmaker.Tata said the Jaguar Land Rover business, which has lost almost £1bn between January and July as the coronavirus pandemic hammers the automotive industry, “remains strong”.Tata Motors, which last year reportedly approached companies including BMW about partnership opportunities with JLR, said it was maintaining “solid liquidity despite the Covid-19 pandemic and expects to be cash positive from the second quarter onwards”.The UK government’s emergency funding scheme, which could have resulted in British taxpayers owning stakes in JLR and Tata steel, also imposed strict conditions on lending to Tata.Requirements for JLR included forcing the company to accelerate its electric vehicle programme and phasing out the diesel cars on which the business still heavily relies.Both businesses remain in talks with the UK government over other areas of support such as potential tax breaks.A spokesman for Tata Steel said reports its parent company was looking to potentially sell the UK business were not true.“We remain in ongoing and constructive talks with the UK government on areas of potential support,” he said. “As these discussions have not reached a conclusion, it would be premature to comment on any options that may or may not be under consideration. “In the meantime, we will not respond to speculative and inaccurate media reports about the future of our operations in the UK or elsewhere.”Last month JLR, which employs 30,000 people in the UK, appointed Thierry Bolloré, a former boss of the French carmaker Renault, as its chief executive. Bolloré will take over next month from Sir Ralf Speth, who has run the carmaker for a decade. Speth will become the non-executive vice-chairman of JLR.Tata Steel, which employs 8,000 people in the UK and has made losses for a decade, was seeking financial support of several hundred million pounds."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5abdf6efc1c4c17fd0977ce0ea2520c84cf7e1e/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49535969c4fdc50b8029ba61ed8861ff","title":"educational inequality begins schools admissions a level results u turn","story":"Regardless of the U-turn, our schools system widens the gap between advantaged pupils and the rest from an early age Covid-19 has blown the doors off the way we live. The virus has been responsible for exposing – and increasing – levels of inequality, and that’s undeniable, politically. Families crammed into rabbit-hutch dwellings suffered proportionally many times the number of infections of those with airy gardens. As the furlough scheme winds down, hundreds of thousands of people will discover there is no social safety net as they queue at food banks.But what the shocking exam-results algorithm fiasco laid bare was an officially approved system for cementing advantage and disadvantage according to birth and social background. The program exposed how those pupils in struggling state schools consigned to the bottom of leagues must stay there, while the advantages of those in top state or private schools are deliberately enhanced. Maimuna Hassan, a student of Somalian heritage with English as her third language, was predicted two A*s and an A, but lost her Cambridge engineering place after dropping grades. She believed this was because previous Ofsted reports had stated that her school “requires improvement”.That’s enough difference to change their lives as schools strive to counter the gravitational pull of a child’s background. No wonder parents strive hard to get their children into the best schools – and the study finds parents across the social spectrum, including those whose children are entitled to free school meals, make the same first choices based on schools’ academic results.Prof Vignoles’ paper recommends ways to equalise intakes, including lotteries or banding so that every school admits even ability numbers, or else giving priority to pupil-premium children. But religious schools, her report finds, are the most socially selective: everyone is familiar with parents on their knees to get a vicar’s letter, and then never seen in church thereafter. It’s time to take religion out of state education. And it’s high time to start curbing private education’s advantages: one clever idea is for Oxbridge and the best universities to take the top few children from every sixth form in the country, whether high- or low-achieving, so that private education loses its value for money.Every year in school widens the social gap between children, research by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows, and poverty is the cause: paying parents more equal wages would do most for social mobility. As this pandemic opens a can of injustices, few are harsher than the gigantic difference in lockdown teaching. Children in private schools kept close contact with teachers, lessons were taught, homework was marked: resources that were bought with three times more funding. Contrast that with a primary head in Southwark, south London, who told me she spent lockdown organising 200 food parcels a week for hungry families, and raising money for the laptops and wifi that Gavin Williamson never delivered: her pupils stood outside using mobiles to catch the school’s wifi to do their homework.Levelling up starts here, not at A-level. No, it really starts at birth, reinstating the lost Sure Start children’s centres supporting families. Funding-starved early years teaching yields many times the lifetime successes of later years.But at least the government  has conceded, and allowed results to be based on teacher-assessed grades. This unlucky cohort has already suffered brutal school-funding cuts lost music, drama and art teaching seen their shabby buildings repaired using money from pupil premiums. There was no need to add further insult to their injury."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae99895dc778a0099f7f0aaafe6fcb27c9c45d2a/0_98_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25292ab77c8c348544d3e7c6f9b89e7a","title":"the british government has created a hostile environment for young people","story":"The right has always despised ‘all must have prizes’, but throughout the A-level grades fiasco, it was more like: all those who can be punished will beIt has been astonishing to witness the downgrading of an entire generation. I am not just talking about A-level results nor were the kids who were shouting: “Fuck the algorithm!” on the streets. This entirely predictable, man-made fiasco was not an accident.It was a combination of negligence and malice. Although the algorithm has now been ditched in favour of teacher assessments and the mess left for universities to clear up, it will be chaos. This is not just about the phenomenal uselessness of particular ministers, but a mindset in which children somehow are always someone else’s problem.This has been apparent from the onset of Covid. Schools were closed. The children of key workers could attend whatever the risk everyone else had to muddle along. “Work at home and homeschool your children,” was the advice. This job inevitably fell to women as, let’s face it, women just sort of do this stuff. It’s in our genes, apparently, like making packed lunches and remembering people’s birthdays. Women will pick up the pieces. The pieces that are actual people – kids who have been stressed, over-tested and told they must work extra hard, then had their exams whisked away.A generation that has been constantly scolded for spending too much time on screens and ruining its own social development is told … guess what. Spend more time on screens. That is where you will get your education now, even if you do get into the university of your dreams.The world became distant and online. During lockdown so many kids withdrew completely, many parents worried if their kids would ever get back out there again. Some worked diligently and some did sod all and thought that come exam time they would smash it. A Boris Johnson strategy, no less.In the early days of lockdown, I felt that not only had children been downgraded but also teachers. The long, slow undermining of the teaching profession – remember when Dominic Cummings was propelling Michael Gove as the education secretary to take on “the blob”? – continued. Austerity forced teachers to become social workers, handing out breakfasts to kids arriving hungry at school. Covid then reduced them from gifted, hard-working professionals running complex institutions to, basically, childminders. I say that with nothing but love for childminders and nursery workers, by the way I just note that such work is considered low-skilled and remains low-paid and is mostly done by women. Again, children are just something that women take care of.It is incomprehensible to me that this government somehow forgot the kids, not even in the David Cameron “left one down the pub way”, but in policy terms. It is almost as if none of them ever actually had responsibility for them.How did it come to this? Why do we despise young people, removing job, housing and educational opportunities and in the end a planet worth living on? As I said, it’s malice, a breaking of a fundamental social contract in which we do the best we can not just for our own children but for everyone’s.There was a peculiar sadism in saying to a child from a low-achieving school: “You will be judged by the record of those who went before you.” It was cruel to say to teenagers who have had none of the rites of passage of leaving school, and have been isolated and anxious, that they must suffer for fear of “grade inflation”. Would it have really mattered in the long run if an entire year got three A*s? Post-Covid adjustments could have been made. How was none of this thought about?Education has been in trouble for a long time. Creativity has been slowly erased from the curriculum in a dumb attempt to make us compete with South Korea. Let’s just say South Korea won.Education is about more than just grades, but this week it has been about grades – and the trampling of dreams. The PM had an urgent glamping trip. Priorities?The contempt with which these kids have been treated is something that even your basic Tory can see. What has been created for young people amounts to a hostile environment. As unemployment rises, jobs, particularly in retail and hospitality, have evaporated. Some of these teenagers are wise beyond their years, shouldering their disappointment with huge maturity. This was a call to arms.The right has always despised the “All must have prizes” aspect of child-centred education and this was the apotheosis of that attitude. All those who can be punished will be.This was not an algorithmic fluke – it was deliberate. The pandemic has shown us who is expendable: old people in care homes, nurses, migrant workers, working mothers and now children.Someone will now have to pick up the pieces, sure.

Belarusian civil society must be allowed to control the future course of eventsOne of the great lessons of the revolutions of 1989 was that regimes built on lies are astonishingly fragile. In the German Democratic Republic, presided over with grim determination by Erich Honecker from 1971 until the fall of the Berlin Wall, there used to be an old joke: despite its name, the state was neither German, nor democratic, nor a republic. The humour expressed a popular awareness that East Germany was not just a bullying state. It was also, in a crucial way, a bogus one. When the opportunity to do something about that arrived, structures of power disintegrated overnight. Literally, in the case of the Wall.Three decades on, it seems that something similar is taking place in Belarus, the country that 1989 forgot. In the eight days since a rigged election awarded him a sixth term as president, authority has drained away from Alexander Lukashenko, the former collective farm director who has ruled since 1994. Suddenly, Mr Lukashenko’s traditional deployment of veiled threats and preposterous claims to mass consent has lost all power to intimidate and coerce.A nation energised by speaking truth to power is asserting itself. The brutal violence unleashed on protesters in the days after the election was answered at the weekend by huge columns of flower-waving women, all wearing the red and white colours of the opposition movement. On Monday, as Mr Lukashenko attempted to address factory workers in Minsk, most of his audience chanted: “Leave now!”. As calls for a general strike gathered momentum, morning newsreaders for Belarus’s state television company left their seats empty. The Belarusian ambassador to Slovakia has taken the side of the protesters. Other members of Mr Lukashenko’s state apparatus will also be wondering how to place themselves on the right side of history.There is, however, no guarantee of a benign outcome to these extraordinary events. Mr Lukashenko’s menacing response to the factory workers was to say: “There won’t be any other elections until you kill me.” He also spent a good part of the weekend on the phone to Vladimir Putin, upon whom much now depends. Belarus is not Ukraine, and its citizens are largely pro-Russian. It is to be hoped that a humiliated strongman’s requests for eventual military assistance fall on deaf ears. Playing a role in a peaceful transition of power may suit Moscow’s interests better than acting as enforcer for an ally no longer fit for purpose.The west, and the European Union in particular, must play the crucial days and weeks to come very carefully indeed. Speaking from Lithuania yesterday, the opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, declared herself ready to lead Belarus through a transition period to a new election. EU leaders will meet in an emergency summit on Wednesday. They should calibrate their approach in consultation with Ms Tikhanovskaya and other opposition figures still in Minsk. The absolute priority should be to avoid the ramping up of EU-Russia tensions, and to give Belarusian civil society the best opportunity to control the course of future events.There is good reason to believe that this is the end of the line for Mr Lukashenko. But the road ahead for a population which is demanding its democratic rights is perilous and uncertain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2cc9c1c5a5f7183d85d928dd19974ac3463a8252/0_186_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d00d9c0e45630417895d1a9d57ff3ff","title":"a levels gcse results england based teacher assessments government u turn","story":"Williamson and Ofqual apologise, scrapping standardisation model after outcryGavin Williamson and Ofqual have apologised to students and their parents, as they announced that all A-level and GCSE results in England will be based on teacher-assessed grades.In a spectacular U-turn, the education secretary announced the government would scrap the controversial standardisation model drawn up by the exams regulator to award grades in lieu of exams.Instead, both A-levels and GCSE results will revert to centre-assessed grades, which were submitted by schools earlier this summer.“We worked with Ofqual to construct the fairest possible model, but it is clear that the process of allocating grades has resulted in more significant inconsistencies than can be resolved through an appeals process,” Williamson said, in remarks released by his department.“We now believe it is better to offer young people and parents certainty by moving to teacher assessed grades for both A- and AS level and GCSE results. I am sorry for the distress this has caused young people and their parents, but hope this announcement will now provide the certainty and reassurance they deserve.”The move had looked inevitable after Wales said it would revert to teacher assessments for A-levels, and Northern Ireland said it would do so for GCSEs, following a similar U-turn in Scotland last week.“The system, for the overwhelming majority of young people, is going to deliver credible, strong results. It’s a robust system, it’s a fair system, it’s making sure that young people get the grades that they’ve worked so hard towards”“Most young people … will get the grade that the teacher sent in to the exam board that they thought they would get.”Q) “Can you give a cast-iron guarantee that you will not be forced into the embarrassing U-turn that John Swinney and Nicola Sturgeon were in Scotland?”A) Absolutely“Let’s be in no doubt about it, the exam results that we’ve got today are robust. They’re good, they’re dependable for employers. It’s very important that for years to come people should be able to look at these grades and think these are robust, these are dependable”Hundreds of pupils took to the streets of London, demonstrating outside the Department for Education to express their anger, while others took to the airwaves and social media to describe their sense of devastation. Lawyers had began to consider taking action on behalf of affected teenagers.The Labour leader, Keir Starmer, welcomed what he called the “screeching U-turn”, saying: “This is a victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week. However, the Tories’ handling of this situation has been a complete fiasco.“Incompetence has become this government’s watchword, whether that is on schools, testing or care homes. Boris Johnson’s failure to lead is holding Britain back.”Ministers had been under increasing pressure to act with GCSE results due to be published this Thursday for more than 600,000 year 11 pupils in England and 100,000 older students aiming for crucial passes in maths and English to qualify them for further training or study.The algorithm used by Ofqual for both A-levels and GCSEs was mainly based on a school’s past results and inidual pupil attainment. Teachers and schools were asked to submit grades, known as centre-assessed grades, but in the end these were influential in only a small number of cases.Ofqual argued that the algorithm was essential to ensure results were standardised across the country and in line with previous years, but hundreds of inidual stories documenting disappointment and an overwhelming sense of injustice among those affected proved too much to ignore.Ofqual confirmed its decision to award centre assessment grades (CAG) to A-level, AS-level and GCSE students, adding that where a moderated grade was higher than a CAG, students could keep that grade.Roger Taylor, Ofqual’s chair, acknowledged the standardised system had caused widespread anguish and damaged public confidence, and apologised to those affected.“We understand this has been a distressing time for students, who were awarded exam results last week for exams they never took. The pandemic has created circumstances no one could have ever imagined or wished for. We want to now take steps to remove as much stress and uncertainty for young people as possible, and to free up heads and teachers to work towards the important task of getting all schools open in two weeks,” he said.“After reflection, we have decided that the best way to do this is to award grades on the basis of what teachers submitted. The switch to centre assessment grades will apply to both AS- and A-levels and to the GCSE results which students will receive later this week.“But we recognise that while the approach we adopted attempted to achieve these goals, we also appreciate that it has also caused real anguish and damaged public confidence. Expecting schools to submit appeals where grades were incorrect placed a burden on teachers when they need to be preparing for the new term and has created uncertainty and anxiety for students. For all of that, we are extremely sorry.“The path forward we now plan to implement will provide urgent clarity. We are already working with the Department for Education, universities and everyone else affected by this issue.”The Worth Less? campaign group, which represents hundreds of secondary school headteachers, welcomed the U-turn.“It’s a relief that this whole unedifying mess has some form of closure,” said Jules White, a secondary school headteacher and leader of Worth Less? “Students will get a much fairer deal and everyone can be pleased with that.“Major questions remain, though: why has it taken the DfE so long to resolve matters? Why have Ofqual and the DfE just spent time blaming each other rather than acting on behalf of children, their families and schools?“And crucially, how can we move confidently to wider school reopening when our political masters don’t understand how schools actually work?”Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of the NAHT school leaders’ union, said: “The government has decided to rely on centre assessed grades for A level and GCSE results this year, agreeing that these are the most reliable measure of student performance.“School leaders and teachers worked with professionalism and integrity to submit these grades for all of their students. Having taken so long to make a decision, this was the only option that government had left to deal with the unfairness.“This decision will mean students expecting their GCSE results can have confidence that they will not experience the same unfairness or disadvantage as their older peers.“The big question remains as to why this decision has taken so long to come, as it may already be too late for some A level students who have already missed out on their first choice of university and course. Every day of delay is going to have loaded more and more difficulty onto universities and their capacity to meet all of the demand for places that will now inevitably come their way. For them, the problem is far from over.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5da49ac587c55fd293cfb2db66bc76e514190926/0_133_4084_2451/master/4084.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a866445b726044c8d099c6712d55d1eb","title":"how have you been affected by the exam results u turn in england","story":"We would like to hear from young people, parents and teachers on how they feel about the scrapping of the standardisation modelThousands of students, parents and teachers are celebrating after the government made a spectacular U-turn on this year’s A-Level results, reverting to teacher-assessed grades.We want to hear from students who missed out on their first choice university due to the results they received last Thursday, but because of the U-turn have now met their offer.

She has since apologized.Opponents’ fears are justified. Gwinnett county has reported more than 20,000 Covid-19 cases, with local infections rising over the past few weeks. Worried teachers have been holding caravan protests against in-person school reopenings.“The district’s plan sends a clear message that any risk we incur for face-to-face learning is worth it, even if it could mean death,” said David Battle, a middle school teacher in Lawrenceville, Georgia. “Who are we willing to sacrifice for face-to-face instruction?”The Orange County Teachers Association has declared an impasse in negotiations with the district over reopening plans and is suing the district to keep virtual learning in place.“Based on the numbers in Florida it is simply not safe to open,” said Gail Weston McDonald, a middle school teacher outside of Orlando. She has severe asthma and was able to receive a doctor’s note to be approved to work from home. “Sadly the students who will be forced to go to school will be students from lower-income families, putting their lives in danger.”Jeffrey Barrois, an elementary school teacher in Jefferson parish outside New Orleans, Louisiana, said his school already had a positive coronavirus case reported while teachers are attending development and training sessions ahead of in-person classes resuming on 26 August.“They didn’t tell us who the person was. They said there are protocols involved, how they determine who has and hasn’t had close contact, an answer to how, I’m not exactly sure,” said Barrois. “The word ‘strike’ has been used, but we haven’t had an official position taken by our union local.”“I’m trying to make things as safe as possible. I’ve personally been stocking up on different masks. We only received one mask. Teachers are buying their own stuff,” said Batten. “My biggest concern is are we going to lose a student or teacher? That’s what scares me the most.”School districts in most major cities and metro areas around the US are beginning the 2020-2021 school year with virtual learning for at least the first few weeks of school pending the state of coronavirus cases in their areas.But several school districts have begun or plan to resume in-person learning. The openings come after pressure from the Trump administration to open up. “SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!” Donald Trump declared on 6 July. He has threatened to take away funding from schools that don’t open and called teachers’ union leaders “disgraceful” for opposing his plans.Nearly 100,000 children around the US have tested positive for coronavirus. And as some schools around the US have begun reopening in person, coronavirus cases have spread with quarantine orders already reported in schools in Georgia, Mississippi, Indiana and North Carolina.He explained teachers were concerned over medical accommodations not being permitted to teachers and staff for at-risk household members, how hybrid learning will work, and concerns over lack of ventilation in schools that have traditionally suffered a lack of cleaning supplies such as soap. In March 2020, schools were not closed until 16 March, as 74 public school employees in New York City died of coronavirus.“In March, when they shut down schools, it left a lot of teachers scarred. A lot of educators died and a lot of our students had family members die and it was clear the virus was spreading because schools were open, and schools were left open longer than most jurisdictions in the US,” said Andrew Worthington, a high school teacher in Manhattan and union chapter leader at his school.Worthington explained teachers were struggling to plan for the school year because there is no set school calendar yet and it remains unclear how many students will be opting for virtual learning over in person and how lunches for students in classrooms will work. Teachers in New York City conducted sickouts in March before schools were shut down and are considering using sickouts again to protest against school reopening plans.The New York State Nurses Association issued a statement calling for New York City to postpone in-person school reopenings, citing the ongoing risks of coronavirus and lack of infrastructure to handle super spreading events.“Our government at a federal level and local level hasn’t done enough still to get the pandemic under control, and make it safe for us to be in school buildings with our students,” said Monique Dols, an early childhood special educator in the Bronx. “Our biggest concern is that the school buildings become an avenue for the coronavirus to spread again like what happened in March.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53840a3d44fcb1766161a2f372574dbb730ed85/0_147_5475_3285/master/5475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=27c847ef98e0643ad28549a461f17dcd","title":"from farm to factory the unstoppable rise of american chicken","story":"How industrial chicken farming transformed an ‘alternative’ meat to the most consumed meat in the USA century ago, Americans would not recognise our modern hunger for chicken. The year-long market for tender but relatively bland chicken meat is a newish phenomenon, and without it the idea of chicken cutlets, $5 rotisseries, or the McNugget would be a fantasy.How did America go from thinking of chicken as an “alternative” meat to consuming it more than any other meat?The story starts with corn.At the turn of the 20th century, chicken was almost always eaten in the spring. The priority for chicken raisers at the time was egg production, so after the eggs hatched, all the male birds would be fed up and then quickly harvested as “spring chickens” – young, tender birds that were sold whole for roasting or broiling (hence the term “broilers”). Outside the spring rush, you might be buying a bigger, fatter fryer or an old hen for stewing.“Farmers were sending chickens of all sorts of ages, different feather colours, and tremendous variety to the marketplace in the early 20th century,” says Roger Horowitz, food historian and author of Putting Meat on the American Table. But almost all chickens in the market were simply surplus to egg production, making them relatively uncommon – even rare. Tender spring chickens in particular could fetch a good price. But it is worth noting, Horowitz says, that the higher price wasn’t necessarily coming from pent-up demand.“It’s not as if consumers were clamoring for broilers,” he says. Though there was some consumer demand for chickens, the relatively high price for broilers likely had more to do with the limited, seasonal supply than a passion for poultry.During the second world war, however, red meat was rationed, and a national campaign encouraged the consumption of poultry and fish to save “meat” (beef, pork and lamb) for “the army and our allies”. Eating chicken became more common, but the preference for young broilers, and white breast meat, persisted. As the war drew to a close, feed millers, which buy and grind corn and other grains to feed livestock, saw a big opportunity to spur that demand for meat chickens, which consume large amounts of corn. When traditional banks refused to finance new-fangled “chicken farms”, the feed companies themselves offered farmers loans to buy feed and equipment, putting the pieces of the modern contract poultry system in place.Consumer acceptance of broilers out of season was not automatic. In the 1930s, the average American ate 10lbs (4.5kg) or less of chicken annually by 2017 that had risen to 64lbs (29kg), according to the Economic Research Service at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). For decades chicken battled to be seen as a “meat”, and did not surpass its most expensive competitor, beef, in terms of overall consumption until 2010. A strong USDA-funded marketing campaign helped out.“In the 50s and 60s, you see where these agricultural extension operations start pushing out recipes very aggressively about broilers,” Horowitz says, and as feed companies and hatcheries (most of which would eventually become so-called “integrators”, which own several of the businesses involved in chicken production) continued to consolidate the industry, they were able to more carefully calibrate the chicken itself to what would sell most profitably, focusing on lowering costs and raising proportions of the highest-demand cuts, namely breast meat.Don Tyson, the late president of Tyson Foods, famously said: “If breast meat is worth two dollars a pound and dark meat is worth one dollar, which would I rather have?” But for generations, the idea of buying just the most coveted cuts of chicken was foreign to most consumers. It wasn’t until the 1980s that preferences began to switch to cuts of meat over the whole bird.These companies owned and understood their chickens from egg to table and were able to exert unprecedented control over the biology of their flocks. Now, not only are they able to fine tune the birds’ characteristics with incredible accuracy, they can also map interactions with feed, environment, and processing to maximise profits.For integrators and corn farmers alike, the investment paid off. In 2019, 9.2 billion 6lb (2.7kg) broiler chickens were harvested in the US, consuming about 1.8lbs (820g) of grain for every pound of chicken.But the impact on chickens from the changes in production is troubling.Over the past 70 years, the poultry industry has measured its success in terms of how many pounds of meat a chicken can produce for a given amount of feed. Modern chickens are more efficient than ever, with producers able to calculate to the ounce how much “input” of food, water, air and time are required to get a set amount of white and dark meat.The modern chicken is fully industrialised.With more than 500 chicken breeds existing on Earth, it might surprise you to learn that every nugget, breast, and cup of chicken noodle soup you’ve ever eaten likely came from one breed, a specialised cross between a Cornish and a white  rock.The genetic lineages of chickens grown by the world’s biggest poultry companies are a closely guarded secret. But one common commercial line, the Cobb 500, originated from a contest held by the USDA’s Agricultural Extension Service in the 1940s, aptly titled the “chicken of tomorrow” competition. The winner, the Vantress chicken, would become the standard meat chicken by the 1950s. This chicken and its many descendants were optimised for a few key factors: large breasts, white feathers, fast and efficient growth, consistent sizes and gentle dispositions.The average size of a grocery store chicken in the 1920s was about 2.5lbs (1.13kg). Today it hovers around 6lbs (2.7 kg), which a broiler chicken can reach in about 47 days, according to the National Chicken Council (even younger, smaller birds are used for fast food restaurants).The use of naturally double-breasted breeds and millions of dollars in research has produced birds with massive breasts, but gaining that muscle mass quickly requires near constant food consumption, and leads the birds to have much lower activity levels. Growing pains lead to sedentary birds.White feathers are key for marketing, because pin feathers and follicles of birds with coloured feathers can hang on to pigmentation, and coloured bird carcasses don’t appear as “clean” or sell as well to picky consumers.Consistent sizing is required to ensure that slaughterhouse line speeds can stay high. Processing chickens is one of the biggest bottlenecks in getting chickens from farms to grocery stores, and consistently sized birds keep the machines running smoothly.Gentle dispositions are also a must as chickens are naturally aggressive and even cannibalistic, especially in confined spaces and large numbers. Poultry houses are more profitable the more birds are inside, so reducing the chickens’ natural disposition to fight and eat one another is key to facilitating modern poultry rearing. Faster-maturing birds also tend to be gentler, because aggressive behavior is more common among sexually mature chickens, a milestone most broilers never reach.With limited diets, these industrial birds can live semi-normal lifes, but if allowed to eat continuously, as they are genetically designed to, they tend to have extremely high mortality rates beyond the ideal harvest date. Counterintuitively perhaps, the industrialisation of chicken led to far fewer choices when buying poultry.“If you look at cookbooks in the 20s and 30s – for a certain kind of dish you get a fat chicken, for another you get a fryer or broiler. And the marketplace distinguished between those kinds of chickens,” Horowitz says. The industry’s obsession with perfecting the broiler machine came at the cost of the consumer’s ability to choose other varieties of chicken.As chickens became more commonplace in grocery stores, brands started to reintroduce variety by offering inidual cuts, skinless and boneless meats, and processed products (which also allowed them to improve the flavour, which had become decidedly bland over time). But as consumers’ interests trend away from more highly processed foods in search of story and connection to place, a niche may be opening for birds other than the Cornish cross.Growing food movements around the world are already spurring conversations about the possibility of making slower-growing chickens of different breeds, harvested at a larger variety of ages, more widely available. Even the company that grows Cobb 500 chicks is offering a new “rustic” variety with golden plumage, rather than the standard white. The conventional poultry industry may actually be poised to lead this trend, as it currently makes chickens of various sizes and ages available to institutional customers (fast food fried chicken, for example, is usually made from smaller, younger birds than are available in the grocery store).In the meantime, breeders and geneticists at the world’s largest poultry companies will continue refining their lines of Cornish cross broilers, in particular to grow quickly in harsh environments or on lower-quality feeds, conditions that might be more common in the developing world.“Instead of just selecting birds for maximum growth and size,” says Clauer, “now the genetic companies can look at 20, 30, 40 parameters and look very closely at the bird’s anatomy, health, structure, all the things that go into a modern bird that makes it much more efficient and have better liveability.”Though competition will likely come as technologies around lab-cultured and cell-based meats continue to progress and gain consumer acceptance, the sheer efficiency and short growth time of chickens is insulating the industry for now.Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a round-up of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

The quality seems variable, but we won’t know what we’re looking at until it is all in.”Good growing conditions over the summer, when about half the wheat harvest was brought in across the country, ended for many regions in the past week with severe thunderstorms following the mini-heatwave, which saw the longest period of temperatures over 34C (93.2F) since comparable records began in 1961.But the problems with the harvest started at the beginning of the year. While this spring was the sunniest since comparable measurements began in 1929, and substantially drier than usual, it followed the wettest February ever recorded. Storms Ciara and Dennis battered many regions of the UK in the early and middle of the month, causing widespread flooding, followed by Storm Jorge at the end.The ground was already wet in many areas, after a sodden winter, and the further downpours seen in February left many farmers unable to plant seeds and a poor start to the growing season for many. All of that was followed by a dry spring that meant germination was difficult and in many places delayed, Bradshaw told the .While there are unlikely to be any problems importing grain, as harvests have held up in other parts of the world, for many farmers it means a difficult end to the year after the disruptions of lockdown.Some grain farmers face an additional pressure: if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of the year, a tariff regime would spell disaster for farm exports. For that reason, many will want to sell their barley crop before the end of December, which may mean having to accept lower prices.“We have a known export market now, but there are then unknowns beyond January,” said Bradshaw.The lockdown affected some sectors far more than others. Dairy farmers were forced to throw away fresh milk that could not be collected, as the catering trade came to an abrupt halt and supply chains could not be immediately remodelled to redirect the production to retailers.People eating all their meals at home ate differently than they would normally: the milky cappuccinos and lattes demanded from coffee shops were out, and the steaks ordered in restaurants gave way to thrifty ways with mince at home. The latter caused particular headaches for meat producers, as normally they strive to “balance” the carcass between expensive and cheap cuts.Potato farmers saw farmgate prices halve, as the chip shop and catering trade disappeared overnight. Many farmers sought out innovative ways to market, from veg boxes to vending machines.Meanwhile, farmers who had ersified into offering accommodation and tourism, with children’s play areas or farm visits – as successive governments had encouraged them to do – have had a seesaw year. That side of their business broke down completely as lockdown prevented travel, but they are enjoying a late resurgence with staycations favoured over foreign trips.While the lockdown was a temporary measure, in the longer term farmers were being forced to grapple with the impact of the climate crisis, said Bradshaw. “What we are seeing is more extremes of weather,” he said. “Dry and wet weather seem to get stuck in patterns.”He pointed to the long drought of 2018, which made growing conditions difficult and left many farmers with a severe shortage of fodder for livestock. Last year, a wet autumn drenched the soil and caused flooding in many areas, destroying or delaying crops across the country.Aidan McGivern, a meteorologist at the Met Office, confirmed that the UK was experiencing a changing climate, with warmer and wetter winters, and rainfall coming in heavier bursts during summers. He said the season of summer thunderstorms – like those currently seen in the southern half of the country - was likely to extend in future from spring to autumn, and heatwaves would become more common.“When we experience a summer heatwave, it is more extreme than in the past,” added Mark McCarthy, the head of the National Climate Information Centre at the Met Office. “Climate change also increases the intensity of rain fall during the summer months, and heatwaves are followed by convective downpours. The challenge is knowing how to manage that.”In future, farmers might have to look at growing different crops, said Bradshaw. Maize and even soya beans might become an option, where previously they were rarely seen in the UK.Farmers were also looking to improve their own land management to account for a more variable climate, he added. “There has been more focus on soils, how they can store more water to be more resilient,” he said. “And we are looking at more spring crops to spread the risk across the year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7a62c1343957b9847d799736335acc8d290e73e/0_124_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ae0db0863055309cae72ff8250e400","title":"us chickens literally sitting in each others waste says rspca brexit","story":"Chlorination of hens and use of pig sow stalls among disparities highlighted by charity ahead of post-Brexit trade talksUS hens have half the living space of UK birds and are dipped in chlorinated water after slaughter to kill bacteria growing on them as a result of the birds “literally sitting in each other’s waste”, according to a new video being launched today by the RSPCA.Aiming to highlight the welfare differences between US and UK farm animals as trade talks resume between the two countries in September, the UK’s largest animal welfare charity is taking the unusual step of releasing a video that “exposes the realities of animal welfare” and warns consumers against US dairy, egg and meat imports.The RSPCA believes lower welfare agri-food imports will weaken the UK’s animal welfare standards and hurt farmers. Its video comes with a petition asking the government to include legal guarantees in the post-Brexit agricultural bill that will ensure “imports produced to lower animal welfare standards than our own will not enter the UK”.September’s fourth round of US trade talks is preceded by this week’s EU-UK talks. The RSPCA additionally fears a no-deal Brexit would increase pressure on Britain to sign a US-favourable trade agreement.“And it’s not just about this government or this trade deal,” said the RSPCA CEO, Chris Sherwood. “We need to be future-proofing our agriculture systems here for the next 10 or 20 years. To do that, what we need to see in the agriculture bill is a cast iron commitment, clause number one, that protects our farmers and our animals from lower welfare imports.”RSPCA Assured is the charity’s food labelling scheme, and operates independently of the main organisation.Farmer and director of the UK’s Sustainable Food Trust, Patrick Holden, said though he supported the RSPCA’s actions, more needs to be done. “It’s no good being slightly better than the US. We need to be much better. If we are going to transition to a sustainable food system then we need to stop producing cheap pork and cheap chicken in the UK.” He acknowledged that would increase food prices, but said cheap food has hidden costs for the environment and public health.Commenting on the RSPCA’s video and petition a UK government spokesperson said in an email: “This government will not sign a trade deal that will compromise our high environmental protection, animal welfare and food safety standards. Our food regulators continue to provide independent advice to make sure all food imports comply with our high standards. Decisions on these standards are separate from any trade agreements. We are focused on getting a deal that works in the best interests of the UK.”Jim Monroe, from the US National Pork Producers Council (NPPC) said: “Over the last 10 years, the United States, on average, has been the top exporter of pork in the world. In any given year, the US pork industry ships products to more than 100 countries. That’s because we produce the safest, most nutritious and most affordable pork in the world. We do so while maintaining the highest standards of animal welfare. Any characterization to the contrary is preposterous.“NPPC supports a stronger trade relationship with the United Kingdom, but will only support a US-UK free trade agreement if the UK is willing to eliminate all tariff and non-tariff barriers and embrace Codex and other international production standards.”Dr Ashley Peterson, seniorvice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the National Chicken Council said: “Poultry processors consider the welfare of the birds a top priority. Not only is it the right thing to do ethically, but it does not make economic sense to mistreat the birds.”“The US Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has guidelines and directives addressing appropriate handling of birds under the federal Poultry Products Inspection Act, and chicken processors strictly adhere to their animal welfare guidelines. This whole process is routinely audited internally, by independent third party auditors and by customers. It is monitored on a continuous basis by FSIS inspectors.”Sign up for the Animals Farmed monthly update to get a round-up of the best farming and food stories across the world and keep up with our investigations.

It’s a great celebratory exclamation. It just makes everyone happy. It’s got to be one of the most famous lines in film history.I grew up in Goldthorpe, Yorkshire. Every Saturday, we’d go to the Empire to watch Flash Gordon with Buster Crabbe. He was a wonderful, sensitive Flash Gordon. It had marvellous music and special effects with dragons, lion men, walking bombs and the Clay People who lived on Mars and spoke backwards. You’d get one half-hour episode each week. Flash would always end up looking like he was about to die, leaving you wondering how he would escape. We’d come out of the cinema and run down the disused railway embankment to play dares. I’d jump over the bushes pretending to be Vultan. I never dreamed that one day I’d play him as a grown man in my 40s.I was invited to Elstree to meet the producer Dino De Laurentiis and the director Mike Hodges. There were all these paintings of me on the walls. I thought: “The sods are having me on – they’ve already cast me.” So I said: “That’s me.” They said: “No.” I just happened to be the spitting image of the character from the comic. Dino said: “We can’t think of anyone else for the part.” I said: “If you offer it to anyone else, I’ll strangle the bastard.”I’m very critical of people who say it’s a camp film. It’s not. It’s perfection. Kenneth Branagh, Patrick Stewart and Derek Jacobi all agree with me: it’s a masterpiece. It was the first time space wasn’t just a black sky. And Queen’s music is amazing, like when Flash and Dale go up in the rocket and collapse into each other’s arms to the sound of Queen’s In The Space Capsule (The Love Theme).The sets are marvellous, too. Everyone’s perfectly cast. It’s a masterpiece of colour, design and acting, with a wonderful comic-strip style. They must never, ever entertain redoing it. There’s always some tosser who wants to repeat things, but they won’t ever better it, so they’d better keep their bloody hands off.Because they were going to be building such massive sets, Dino De Laurentiis wanted to plan a sequel right at the outset, and I was offered the job of directing Flash Gordon 2. “I am the wrong director for this,” I said. “I don’t know about special effects or Flash Gordon or any other American comics.” I was brought up on the Dandy and the Beano. We left it at that, but then Dino fell out with the first director and came after me again to direct the first film. He flew me out to New York on Concorde with a bumper fun book of Flash Gordon. I met Danilo Donati, the costume designer, and with fear and trepidation, I said: “OK. I’ll do it.”We had a problem with the skies, until the special-effects team came up with a way of forming clouds by injecting colours into saline water and slowing the footage down. We largely cast to match the looks from the 1930s strip cartoon. The acting just followed. Flash had to have a chiselled jaw, the all-American boy. Dino’s mother-in-law saw Sam J Jones on the TV show Hollywood Squares, so we flew him over. I know he’s got Rotten Tomato reviews, but Flash isn’t supposed to be the sharpest knife in the drawer. He’s genuinely innocent and you can believe he’s a football player.Dale had to be the perky, New York girl. I don’t know who decided that the Hawkmen should have beards. I remember watching Wales beating the hell out of England in the rugby and the phone rang and it was Dino who said: “The team in red. Number nine. Number five. Number four. Number one. Hawkmen.” I said: “They’re not going to want to hang on wires for six months while we film them.” He hung up and the Welsh rugby team were never mentioned again. Brian Blessed comes at the beginning of the film but disappears until nearly the end. He played the role with such enormous energy that I was extremely grateful.The film works on two levels. It’s a Saturday morning action movie for children but, on another level, I think it had a serious effect on some men’s sexual fantasies. They loved the voluptuous Princess Aura.Forty years later, the eight-year-olds who watched it as children can now watch it with their own children. The children will see the innocent side and the adults will see the sexual side and the circle will start again.• Flash Gordon: The 40th anniversary 4K edition is out now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09feeb33f629eb142a039c245179a740189ef73c/0_343_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32d316808a519a8bfe282cde7bebcefd","title":"rachel roddy recipe peppers and potatoes","story":"Peppers that are slightly past their best sing in this thrifty recipe for sweet and sour peppers with spudsIt looked so nice in the fruit bowl that I just left it there, red and muscly among the pears. Every time it caught my eye, which was often, I admired it, then thought “must-put-in-fridge-before-it-wrinkles”. It had started to wrinkle by the time it reached the fridge. I also suspected a soft spot, which I hoped would go away in the fridge drawer. Strangely, it did not go away, and the next day I picked up the pepper and put my thumb through its side. Fresh, bloat, active decay, advanced decay, dry: the five stages of decomposition, one of the few things I remember from biology lessons at school. They are the stages of vertebrate animal decomposition, I know (I feel them all), but surely they can be applied to fruit and vegetables, too? As hard as I try to be vigilant, I usually have something at all five stages of decomposition in my kitchen, especially at this time of year, when the window between firm and ripe with a halo of fruit flies is not a big one. Tomatoes, apricots and peaches are the trickiest: the kitchen counter in August is a sort of incubator, but the fridge numbs out flavour, and in the case of tomatoes alters their flesh so you get that soft, mealy texture when they’re brought back to room temperature. Again, I feel this. I also know the red pepper should never have been in the fruit bowl it was careless, and now here I am with my thumb inside a soft, gaping hole.Active decay requires action. “It won’t hurt you, Just wash or scrape it off, cut it off or out.” I’m glad to have learned these lessons young from every woman in my family, and to have had them fortified by Vincenzo, who is his grandmother’s grandson and even more ruthless than me – only not as careless. Cutting off the rotten bit felt like amends for my carelessness. As did slicing what was left and cooking it slowly in olive oil with sliced red onion and, after a while, ene, then treating it all to a handful of pine nuts, currants, sugar and vinegar for what turned out to be a Sicilian-tasting sweet-and sour-mixture to have with potatoes.I have used ene, escarole and romano lettuce in this dish, and they all worked beautifully, wilting down into floppy rags but retaining their sturdy midribs. I’m sure rocket or radicchio would work, too. The thing to remember is to let the onions and peppers cook until they have lost their raw, sunny crunch and softened completely. This takes time, so don’t rush or be afraid to let the edges of the peppers and onions catch ever so slightly: in this, you catch flavour. It turns out that slightly wrinkled peppers actually do this more effectively and willingly than fresh, muscly ones.Not that I am advocating carelessness or decomposing vegetables: simply noting that if you did happen to encounter active decay, use it to your advantage: sweet and sour.2 red onions1 large red pepper6 tbsp olive oil1 garlic clove1 pinch red chilli flakes1 tbsp pine nuts or chopped almonds1 tbsp currants (optional)1 tbsp sugar1 tbsp red wine vinegar1 small head ene or lettuce, cut into thick ribbons800g waxy potatoesPeel and halve the onion, then cut it lengthways into slender new moons. Cut away the pith, seeds and any soft spots from the red pepper, then slice it into strips, roughly 5mm wide x 10cm long.Put the onion, pepper, olive oil and a pinch of salt in a frying pan, set it over a medium-low heat and cook slowly, stirring often, until the vegetables are soft. Add the garlic, still in its skin but crushed, and chilli, nuts and currants, then cook a bit longer.Make a well in the middle of the vegetables before adding the sugar and the vinegar, let it bubble a few seconds, then stir. Add the ene or lettuce and cook, stirring, until it wilts. Taste for salt, and add more sugar, vinegar or both, if you think it needs it.Meanwhile, boil the peeled and quartered potatoes in well-salted water until tender. Drain, cut into rough chunks, toss with the peppers and leave to sit for 20 minutes – and up to an hour – before tossing again and serving alone, or with lamb chops, sausages or hard-boiled eggs."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7d0a0e1af6beac6ca8a65811bb510bf1ea8a223/0_74_3200_1920/master/3200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf4367b54402d27b113ba161a3fcb3f7","title":"inter shakhtar donetsk europa league semi final report lukaku","story":"Internazionale cruised into the Europa League final with a crushing victory against Shakhtar Donetsk.Antonio Conte’s side led by a single goal at the interval after Lautaro Martínez had headed them in front but blitzed their opponents with four more goals in the second half. Danilo D’Ambrosio increased the lead and Martínez was on target again before Romelu Lukaku’s late double extended the former Manchester United and Everton striker’s Europa League scoring streak: he has now scored in his last 10 matches in the competition.Inter are back in the final of a European competition for the first time since their memorable treble of 2009‑10 under José Mourinho and Friday’s showpiece against Sevilla will be the 10th European final in their history. Shakhtar, who were looking to reach their second, having won the Uefa Cup in 2009, will go home with regrets after failing to show any urgency on the night.Martínez headed home Nicolò Barella’s cross after a mistake by the goalkeeper, Andrei Pyatov, in what was the game’s first attempt on goal. Shakhtar enjoyed the majority of possession, especially in the first half, but looked stumped as to how to deal with Conte’s organised and disciplined defensive unit. The Ukrainian side finally offered something late in the first half when Marcos Antonio’s long-range effort flew narrowly over the crossbar.Another mistake early in the second half almost gifted Inter a second goal. Davit Khocholava got himself in a mess on the ball and Martínez fairly barged him aside before spotting Pyatov off his line and going for a lob, but Shakhtar’s veteran keeper leapt high to tip the ball away.Shakhtar had a golden opportunity to equalise just after the hour mark. It looked a carbon copy of the goal which Inter had scored in the first half. Mykola Matviyenko swung in a cross and Júnior Moraes met it with a header but his effort was straight at Samir Handanovic. Either side of him and it would have been a goal.It proved pivotal as Inter went straight down the opposite end and extended their lead when D’Ambrosio headed in from a Marcelo Brozovic corner. Martínez fired in his second goal of the game after 74 minutes with a low shot from 20 yards before Lukaku got on the scoresheet four minutes later, calmly beating Pyatov when put through one-on-one with the goalkeeper. The Belgian scored again seven minutes from time, showing a good turn of pace to race past his marker before firing past Pyatov once more.“It’s an incredible night, the kind we dreamed of. It has been a long time since I had played such a match and we have shown that Inter are ready for the big matches,” Martínez told Sky Sport Italia. “I am very happy for the team, which is playing well and growing match after match.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2197badca1ce1740d6827b29992e58ee92b066e7/0_19_1140_684/master/1140.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62ad297868240f682dd5cf6363958dc8","title":"manchester city to honour david silva with statue at etihad stadium","story":"David Silva has joined Real Sociedad on a free transfer after leaving Manchester City. The Spanish midfielder had been set to join Lazio, but the La Liga side made a late move to hijack the deal.Lazio had reportedly agreed a three-year contract with Silva and booked medicals for the players in Rome, only for Real Sociedad to contact the World Cup winner and secure his signature. The Serie A side have yet to comment publicly but are thought to be extremely unhappy with the turn of events.Silva has found his new club on the day it was announced that he will be honoured with a statue at the Etihad Stadium. The 34-year-old will also have a training pitch named after him with a mosaic alongside it at the club’s academy complex.The City chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, said: “David Silva is a transformational player – a quiet leader who has acted quietly and deliberately and inspired everyone around him, from the youngest academy player to his senior teammates over the past 10 years.“He has put a stamp on the team, on this club, its history and even the Premier League as a whole. In doing so he has been instrumental to the beautiful football philosophy you see today. He was the start of it.”Silva will join his former City captain and teammate Vincent Kompany in having a statue at the ground. The club announced last year the Belgian would receive such an honour and it is planned for both statues to be unveiled in 2021. The mosaic at the training pitch will celebrate Silva’s starring role in City’s stunning 6-1 defeat of Manchester United at Old Trafford in 2011.Mubarak added: “As with Vincent before him, David’s statue will act as a lasting reminder of the wonderful moments that he gave us, not only as an incredible footballer, but as an inspiring ambassador who represented this football club with great dignity at all times.”Silva’s City career came to an unhappy end with Saturday’s Champions League quarter-final defeat by Lyon in Lisbon.

The decision was taken to turn to the Dutchman during a three-hour board meeting at the Camp Nou on Monday, before Setién’s departure was announced.Koeman has a release clause that allows him to leave the Dutch national team for Barcelona. The 57-year-old has made no secret of his ambition to take charge but he must decide if he wants to do so in far from ideal circumstances exacerbated by the humiliation of their 8-2 Champions League defeat to Bayern Munich.The former Southampton and Everton manager was approached by Barcelona in January but did not want to walk away from the Netherlands five months before Euro 2020. Koeman is understood to have been offered a two-year contract but there will be presidential elections in March after the cloub announced they had been brought forward. His continuity would be in the hands of whoever succeeds Josep Maria Bartomeu as president and the leading opposition figure and the favourite to win, Víctor Font, has made it clear that if he is elected his manager would be Xavi Hernández.Bartomeu’s preference has been the former Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino and he had been backed by Ramón Planes and Eric Abidal, in charge of the technical secretariat. But it is likely that Abidal, the fourth sporting director that Bartomeu has had, may also be sacked in the coming days and other board members urged the president to rethink owing to Pochettino’s identification with city rivals Eyol.Pochettino had previously said he would prefer to go and work on his farm in Argentina than manage Barcelona, although he distanced himself from that remark in an interview with El País last week, insisting: “you never know.”Faced by pressure from his directors, some of whom have called for him to walk away amidst the crisis and pave the way for new elections immediately, Bartomeu called Koeman to take over. On Sunday night, he departed the Camp Nou and admitted that Setién was “out” and a 14-person board meeting – eight of them at the Camp Nou, six joining online – ratified that decision the following morning although there was still no announcement by mid-afternoon.The board also discussed the post of sporting director, the restructuring of the squad, with mass departures necessary before any signings can be made, and the possibility of bringing forward presidential elections – with early 2021 among the options. Bartomeu does not plan to face the media but a statement is expected shortly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/df1f6cae4aa30ad66dae5f17aa41a79fccca8945/0_187_1368_821/master/1368.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24da72c75293e2b5ba43b34aa824b61f","title":"how we met he just grabbed me and gave me a big snog","story":"Lynn and Kim Davies, 53 and 54, found love on stage after their characters shared a kiss. They live together in a small Worcestershire villageLynn Davies moved to Worcestershire from Bristol in October 1999, trading in city life for a country village. “I was working as a freelance television writer. I wanted the chance to explore a rural lifestyle and find a real community,” he says. He had only been there for a few days, when a shopkeeper suggested he go to the village hall for a drama club meeting. He didn’t realise until he got there that it was an audition for a play.When he arrived, he spotted Kim Cresswell, who worked as a housekeeper at a country estate and had joined the group to meet new people. “I thought she was striking. But I couldn’t start chatting someone up the minute I’d arrived.” He submitted a form to join the group, and Kim noticed that he had trained at Lamda, the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. “I thought: ‘Right, we’re having him. We won’t see anything like that in this village again.’”Before they knew it, they had both been cast in the play. “I’m not sure we’d even exchanged names before we had to rehearse this scene together,” Lynn recalls. It was a romantic scene, where the characters kissed. “He just grabbed me and gave me a big snog,” laughs Kim. “The characters clearly liked each other so I figured we should probably do it properly,” Lynn adds.Later that evening, there was a party and the pair got chatting. They snuck into the village hall kitchen to share a bottle of wine. “I knew by the end of the evening that I was going to marry him,” says Kim. “I told my best friend and she said I was utterly mad. I had to take him to see her so she could make sure he was good enough.” Luckily, Lynn aced the interview.The couple took things slowly over Christmas and began dating properly in the new year. By March 2000, Lynn had moved into Kim’s house, where she lived with her five-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. “They adored each other from the start. On one of the first nights he put her to bed, I remember them getting out her drum kit. I had to laugh,” Kim says.They married in September that year on Iona, a remote island in Scotland. “Lynn suggested it and I thought: ‘Why not?’ It was organised over the phone.” They didn’t tell anyone about the wedding, but persuaded the local vicar and his daughter to travel up to perform the ceremony. “We asked the landlady and landlord of the bed and breakfast we stayed at to be our witnesses. It was just us, them and a tourist who was visiting the church at the time,” says Lynn.They took pictures on the beach before heading out for a meal together. “We wanted a small private wedding and Iona is an incredibly spiritual place,” says Lynn. Kim trusted his judgment. “I’d never been on any adventures before we met and now we’ve had so many.”The couple say they complement each other well. “I’m a country mouse and he’s a town mouse,” Kim says. “I’ve introduced him to all the community activities he came looking for, and he holds my hand when we go to the city.”Over the years, they have been involved in many small productions, from village plays to special events like the local asparagus festival. Although they don’t perform together as much now, they still share a love for drama. “We go out to different historical sites and always end up raiding the dressing-up box,” says Kim. “We just enjoy taking silly pictures and having fun together.” They also try to travel to Iona every year for their anniversary.Lynn supported her recent career change, and Kim now works for a mental health crisis line. “He makes me laugh all the time,” says Kim. “And I’ve learnt more from him than I ever did at school. He’s pushed me to be better and I owe him a lot.” Lynn describes his wife as the most thoughtful person he has ever met. “She’s the only thing that keeps me sane. We don’t have to do anything to be happy together.”• Want to share your story?

It’s been a sanctuary to return to from countless trips around the region, a place where the rigours, and sometimes dangers, of Iraq, Syria, Libya and elsewhere could be set aside for a while.In Lebanon, I could get things done. For all its faults, it’s a can-do place, where resourcefulness has got its people through. And it’s needed to be. Almost nothing works as it’s supposed to here: just getting by requires the spirit of an entrepreneur and a handyman.Few of the things we would take for granted elsewhere – electricity, clean water, waste disposal, the internet – are a given here. I’ve become proficient at each, just as I have in overlooking the country’s profound flaws. The dysfunction that underwrites Lebanon is part of the pact of living here. But no one could have guessed that it would end up destroying Beirut – literally.The explosion that thundered through the city on 4 August was clearly not normal. Since the end of the civil war, there had only been a few explosions here – car bombs that assassinated people. But this cataclysmic event was of a different magnitude. Whole streets of buildings were wrecked the closer to the port, the greater the chaos. I’d experienced explosions in Baghdad, Aleppo, Gaza, Mosul and southern Lebanon, but always during war and never on this scale. What on earth had just happened?As the dust cleared that fateful night, as the cascading of glass from high-rise towers slowed, the panicked aftermath of the blast turned to cold anger this had probably been very preventable. It wasn’t a hostile act, but a disaster borne of staggering incompetence and indifference to the welfare of the city’s residents.Nearly 3,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate, one of the more lethal explosive compounds, had been stored in a shed at the entrance to town for six years. Within days of the blast, we learned that fireworks had been kept in the same shed, and a welder may have started a fire that ignited it all.The chain of events was unfathomable, as was the sheer scale of the damage. All the places where my formative memories of Beirut took shape were destroyed. Many of the people who helped shape them were wounded, some of them badly. I’ve made a career in the Middle East trying to keep a dispassionate distance from the events I’ve covered and people I’ve met. But that nominal barrier didn’t apply this time. This was personal.Everything that had blighted Lebanon – the corruption and incompetence of its leaders, the indifference of officials, nepotism, non-state actors, the widespread abuse of power – had come together in an apocalyptic storm that had shocked the world. How on earth could it have been allowed to happen?More than a week later, a broken city is still wrestling with the aftermath, as it is with the truly existential question of whether a functioning country can emerge from the ruins. Paying for the damage is beyond the capability of a bankrupt state already brought to its knees by three decades of industrial-scale corruption.International aid will help with the first stages of recovery. Life will go on for the Lebanese who decide to stay, or can’t leave. But what sort of an existence will it be here? If this isn’t the impetus to put the state on a more credible and sovereign footing, could anything succeed in turning things around?My house is repaired (I was 1.2 miles from the centre of the explosion), as are those of friends and colleagues who were closer to the port. If there is a “normal” left in Lebanon, I’m somewhere near it. But life here is unsettling now, more so than at any point in Lebanese history this is the moment of reckoning.I moved to Istanbul from Beirut 18 months ago, and I’ve been back a few times since. Every trip it’s been obvious how quickly Lebanon is sinking into intense poverty because of the financial crisis. It’s been sad to watch it unfold from afar. I was actually supposed to be travelling to Beirut for the first time since Covid-19 lockdowns lifted the week of the explosion anyway, and had already braced myself to see a much changed country. I didn’t expect to be frantically making phone calls and sending messages to check on the whereabouts of friends in the aftermath of one of the most powerful explosions ever recorded.When you’re flying into Beirut, one of the easiest landmarks to spot from the plane is the port, with its giant grain silos towering over the eastern, Christian side of the city. I used to use it as a marker to figure out where my old apartment was from the air. The night after the explosion, the whole docks area was ablaze with rescue teams’ floodlights, and the hipster-ish neighbourhood of Mar Mikhaël behind it – my old home – lay in total darkness. It was surreal.It truly is difficult to comprehend the scale of this disaster. A friend showed me the remains of his flat and I couldn’t understand how he was still alive. The first apartment I lived in in Beirut, 900 metres from the port, was blown to smithereens. Luckily, my elderly neighbours were not home at the time.The speed with which teams of volunteers from all over the country mobilised to help those whose homes were affected is a true testament to the kindness and generosity of ordinary Lebanese people. Their dedication to helping out neighbours and strangers alike stands in stark contrast to the non-existent clean-up effort from the state. More than once I saw groups of police and soldiers standing by, looking on as citizens did all the work.One thing that will probably stick with me – and all Beirutis – forever is the sound of broken glass, absolutely everywhere, all the time: falling from tower blocks and skyscrapers being swept or bulldozed out of half a city crunching under your shoes like fresh snow.It’s one thing to report in war zones and dangerous places when you’ve made careful calculations about risk and you know what to expect when you arrive. Scenes of devastation akin to Syria or Iraq in a place you considered as home, and as safe, is heartbreaking in a different way. The people of Lebanon deserve so much better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d290253d871b5808cb40e69388f5b2cbfd3fa2fb/690_1049_3743_2248/master/3743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=583202b1fe6b78f88b9fdcd7687f6403","title":"farewell to pete way bassist ufo","story":"Too wild even for Ozzy Osbourne, UFO’s Pete Way, who has died aged 69, set the bar for rock excess – but also for what the bass guitarist could bring to a hard rock bandPete Way was made for the 1970s, when to be a rock musician was as much a chance to live exactly as one wanted, as a means to make music. As Ozzy Osbourne put it, unnervingly: “They call me a madman, but compared to Pete Way I’m outta my league he’s fucking mental!”But if it’s easy to simply push Way into the box labelled “Wild Men of Rock” – not least because it would be hard to dispute the proposition that his best musical days were done by the 1980s – it would also be unfair. As the bassist of UFO from 1968, he was a major creative force in the band who, alongside Thin Lizzy and Judas Priest, built the bridges between the the blues-based hard rock of the 1970s and the much sharper lines of the emergent metal scene of the late 70s. Not for nothing were UFO favourites of Steve Harris of Iron Maiden, who still take to the stage to UFO’s Doctor Doctor.UFO, who had begun as a bluesy, slightly dull space rock band, were transformed when the wunderkind German guitarist Michael Schenker joined in 1973. Very quickly they shifted to a melodic hard rock, and by the late 70s they were a very distinctive group indeed, with Schenker’s guitar lines intertwining with Paul Raymond’s keyboards and Way’s bass playing, which rarely took the least-resistance path of playing endless root notes.Way also emerged as an important writer for the band: Only You Can Rock Me, one of the great hard rock singles of the late 70s, was pretty much all his work, and he contributed to a bunch of their best songs – Lights Out, Too Hot to Handle, Shoot Shoot, Natural Thing, Mother Mary and their hit single Let It Rain. More than, that, though, he helped reinvent the role of the bass player: not just the bloke who stood still at the back of the stage in front of his amp, but a showman, part of a troika of showmen who fronted the band, along with Schenker and singer Phil Mogg. They made their reputation on the road, especially in America, leading to the live album Strangers in the Night, capturing them at their zenith as an arena rock band. Patterson Hood of Drive-By Truckers saw them in 1977, opening for ACDC, and told me: “They were beyond phenomenal. ACDC was great too, but I’ll go to my grave swearing that UFO took the night.”Speaking to me last year, Schenker characterised the personalities of the members of UFO (he described himself as “shy and fragile and sensitive”). Mogg, he said, was “the control freak” drummer Andy Parker was the butt of the jokes, but accepted it because he liked the attention Way was “the very friendly outgoing person”. He was also, Mogg told me, the practical joker. “He would change the sign on the Holiday Inn to Welcome Andy No Neck Parker and The Puppet Show. He would get the hotel to change it.” On one occasion he stole a hotel manager’s dachshund to take to that night’s show, returning afterwards to find the manager devastated, assuming he’d lost his dog.Way left UFO in 1982, disgruntled at the poppier direction they followed. He formed Fastway with “Fast” Eddie Clarke who had left Motörhead, but in true Way fashion, left to join Ozzy Osbourne’s band before Fastway had recorded a note. He then formed his own band, Waysted, the name an accurate reflection of his interests (he was not deserted by his admirers: Waysted toured the UK supporting Iron Maiden, and Osbourne joined them onstage to sing Paranoid at their Hammersmith show with Maiden). But Way would never hold the same place in hard rock as he had with UFO, and his career tailed off into the familiar round of band reunions, side projects and solo albums.So Pete Way died in the way most musicians do, no longer near the spotlight. That he deserved his place in that beam, though, was evident as the tributes rolled in over the weekend. From his former bandmates, of course, and from his contemporaries and those he inspired – Ozzy Osbourne, Geezer Butler, Kirk Hammett, Saxon, Tom Morello, Pearl Jam, Nikki Sixx, Geddy Lee. It’s worth noting the number of bass players in that list, because no matter how colourful his life, it’s the music he left behind in those few years with UFO that will be his legacy.• This article was updated to remove an image that had been wrongly labelled by a photo agency as featuring Way."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79580027b5ee635f494334e11574e0f2424d1729/113_476_1693_1017/master/1693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a05cc19305bee7c240d3df0eb3cf4c0","title":"we want a fairer society freddy lim taiwans metalhead mp","story":"The frontman of metal band Chthonic has also won two terms as a member of Taiwanese parliament. He explains how music gave him a voice – and what he wants to say nextIt’s a crisp December night in the heart of Taipei, and Freddy Lim is presiding over a campaign rally to remember. Flanked by his bandmates, and looking out over a 50,000-strong crowd, he steps to the front of the stage and lets out a guttural scream. Even without the CO2 cannons, video screens and orchestra at his back, or the facepaint daubed on his forehead, it’s an unlikely scene for a parliamentary candidate in the thick of a re-election campaign.“During the campaign I was so exhausted every day,” he remembers, looking back on the events of 21 December. The night’s rally-cum-concert has just been released for posterity as Taiwan Victory Live, his band Chthonic’s latest live album and concert film – as well as a document of his two vocations, metal and legislative politics, mid-collision. “But on stage, I felt like I’d been refreshed, like there were thousands of people at my back and I could do anything,” he grins.“Those people banging their heads and moshing, exchanging energy with you, they provide something very unique, deep in your soul, that can support you to keep going. I’m so happy we did it, because my team had debates over whether voters might have wanted their member of parliament to seem more serious. If I went back to being a metalhead, would it be a good image? But a lot of fans and supporters, after that concert, tried to mobilise campaigns to convince people to vote for me in my district. I don’t think any other kind of event can do that.” He held his seat.Since forming in 1995 with Freddy on lead vocals, Chthonic have become cultural ambassadors for Taiwan – its history, myths and struggles. China maintains that Taiwan is part of the People’s Republic of China: not a sovereign entity, but a rogue province that will one day be brought under its control. Acknowledging Taiwan’s independence, and risking reprisals from China, has therefore become awkward for other countries. As a result, Taiwan is excluded from the World Health Organisation and the United Nations, has official diplomatic ties with only 14 UN member states, and since emerging as a democracy in the late 1980s and early 90s, has faced internal tensions between pro-independence and pro-China factions.Releasing eight albums of uncompromising, category-defying metal and playing hallowed metal arenas such as Donington Park and Ozzfest, Chthonic have drawn lyrical themes from their country’s past, telling the stories of indigenous peoples and their mistreatment. It’s something that evolved naturally in Freddy’s life and writing, but gradually began to convey a real sense of responsibility.“During our teenage years we feel a lot of pressure from outside, and there are a lot of complicated emotions on the inside,” he says of what drew him to metal. “Through high school my parents got orced and I faced some difficulties within my family. Metal allowed me to relax and release what I was feeling. Later on I found metal bands who were not just expressing emotions but also had thoughts on issues like racism, conflicts between different ideologies, or were trying to uncover their country’s mythology and culture. When I formed Chthonic, I started to think more about what ideas the music could carry. And when that involves complicated issues about society, you have to do more, to contribute more.”He says events in the country’s history, such as the violent repression of the indigenous Seediq people by Japanese colonists in the 20th century, or the years between 1949 and 1987 that were spent under martial law (often referred to as the White Terror), “come with heavy burdens. When we read these stories, we feel a lot of deep emotions. I need to get the feelings they bring up out with music, or I’d explode, I think!”As Chthonic’s career progressed, the whole band became more and more heavily involved in championing human rights causes. Bassist Doris Yeh has been an eloquent spokesperson in the global metal press, turning a spotlight on everything from the Awakening Foundation, a group that combats gender-based discrimination and inequality in Taiwan, to Hong Kong’s pro-democracy Umbrella movement. And in 2007, the five-piece memorably hit the US on what they branded the “UNlimited Taiwan” tour, calling attention to Taiwan’s exclusion from international organisations such as the United Nations.“Before that time the Taiwanese government had tried to buy ads in the political columns and introduce what’s happened between Taiwan and China, and why Taiwan couldn’t be a member of those international organisations,” Lim remembers. “I don’t want to say that those ways have been useless, but they’ve put a limit on our imagination. With music, with movies, with more soft power, I think Taiwan can show different sides, and make people want to get involved.”Freddy was elected as chair of Amnesty International Taiwan, a post he held between 2010 and 2014. But after the Sunflower Movement brought a new wave of youth activism in the country, occupying the Legislative Yuan arm of parliament in protest against a trade pact that would bring the country more into alignment with China, he began to feel that standing on the outside was no longer enough. “I started to try and convince more people that they should get involved directly in politics to push their ideas. I hit a point where I thought: I can’t only be a supporter, I have to work with them.” He formed the New Power Party (NPP) and ran for office in 2015.After being elected as a member of Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan in 2016’s election as part of the fledgling NPP, running on a platform of social justice and support for Taiwanese independence, Freddy used his first term in office to champion progressive causes. The theme he comes back to most frequently is the importance of breaking an older generation’s stranglehold on political office.“Nowadays, the metabolism of politics of Taiwan is quite healthy. I can see a lot of young people getting involved or running for office. It makes our politics healthier and more erse.” He laughs. “For example, in politics when people mention me, they see me as part of the young generation. Come on, I’m 44!Choosing to run as an independent in search of his second term – part of a coalition of young independent candidates on the progressive end of Taiwanese politics, Democracy Frontline – Freddy was banking on that very generation stepping up and getting behind him. It seems to have worked. At the election this January, he won in a tight race against a representative of the traditionally conservative, pro-China Kuomintang party. “Mobilising young people and working together, across party lines – it’s very important. This is the right place for me.”Now, Freddy’s two worlds are coming together again in his new podcast with Emily Y Wu, Metalhead Politics. He views it as a forum for publicising Taiwanese political issues worldwide (particularly the country’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic) while also serving as a launch-pad for new material from Chthonic.“We’re discussing how, maybe instead of albums, we should write more singles and release them once in a while,” he muses. “We don’t play live too much, maybe once a year in Taiwan only. If we can write some new songs or produce the concerts well with some unique ideas, we can put them online so fans anywhere can also enjoy the shows and new music. It’s important to get people listening to what’s going on here – whether they’re metalheads or not.”• Chthonic’s album Taiwan Victory Live, and episodes of Freddy Lim’s podcast Metalhead Politics, are both available now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51614fe759336777a1200a7433e5b79555470d0e/189_224_3020_1811/master/3020.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d89cad4d2785b93b5384139d2cead657","title":"alex salmond scottish government refuses to hand legal papers to inquiry","story":"Documents on harassment complaints too sensitive to disclose, says deputy first minister John SwinneyThe Scottish government has refused to hand over significant legal papers to a Holyrood investigation into the handling of harassment complaints against Alex Salmond, claiming they are too sensitive to disclose.John Swinney, the deputy first minister, told the specially convened Scottish parliament committee that the government would withhold its papers on the former first minister’s legal action against it, its own legal advice and key documents from its internal inquiry.Opposition MSPs on the committee are furious, accusing the government of sabotaging the investigation and muzzling civil servants. They are now considering applying to court for legal papers to be released and could invoke a clause in the Scotland Act 1998 which allows Holyrood to compel the disclosure of government documents and to compel witnesses to appear.The committee inquiry will start hearing oral evidence on Tuesday by calling Leslie Evans, the Scottish government’s permanent secretary, who oversaw a botched internal inquiry into two historic sexual harassment complaints against Salmond launched in early 2018. Salmond denied the allegations.Salmond sued the government in August 2018, accusing it of breaching natural justice by failing to allow him a proper chance to defend himself. He won the case after government lawyers admitted in court in January 2019 the inquiry had been mishandled, and called for Evans to resign.Evans will give evidence under oath, and has insisted on bringing with her the Scottish government’s most senior solicitor. Salmond, the first minister Nicola Sturgeon, and her husband, Peter Murrell, the chief executive of the Scottish National party, are due to appear before the committee later this year.The committee will also investigate Salmond’s allegations that Sturgeon’s close aides and civil servants orchestrated a witch-hunt against him – a charge Sturgeon has rejected.Those allegations intensified during Salmond’s subsequent court appearance on 14 charges of alleged sexual misconduct, including an attempted rape, although the Holyrood inquiry will avoid any discussion of those allegations or the evidence heard during the trial.Salmond was acquitted on all charges by a high court jury after his lawyer alleged there had been a conspiracy involving some of the 10 women involved in the case, senior figures in the Scottish government and the SNP.In a letter published on the eve of the Evans hearing on Tuesday, Swinney rejected the committee’s repeated demands for release of legal papers and internal reports on the original harassment inquiry, claiming the documents were legally privileged.Swinney added that ministers could not release reports or notes from civil servants who investigated the first two complaints against Salmond. Ministers would, however, support an application to the court to release its submissions to the judicial review taken by Salmond in 2018.Swinney and Evans also insist civil servants cannot be expected or compelled to offer opinions on what happened, claiming that would breach the civil service code. MSPs on the committee believe that is an attempt to muzzle officials, and have warned Evans and Swinney they will use their parliamentary powers to ensure transparency.Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour’s deputy leader, and a committee member, said: “It is so disappointing that the Scottish government, having promised cooperation and transparency at the start of this process, now appears to be turning its back on that pledge.”Alex Cole-Hamilton, for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, added: “This committee must get to the bottom of a series of events that has cost Scottish taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds and left the Scottish government deeply embarrassed.“The committee has already faced challenges over securing documents and statements from persons of interest. That evasiveness does not serve the people of Scotland well.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6269f8a5b9ce06cdcd699819e7ff3fc05b9e81a0/0_517_2866_1719/master/2866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dea92443c12df133d6fb1c70ada598f","title":"have you accessed a food bank in the uk for the first time coronavirus","story":"We would like to hear from people who have used a food bank for the first time during the coronavirus pandemicAccording to figures from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) in July, millions of people went hungry or relied on food bankds during the first few weeks of lockdown.We would like to hear from people who have used a food bank for the first time during the pandemic.How have you been coping and what was your experience like?

Harding, an ex-chief executive of the TalkTalk mobile phone company, is already the chair of the regulator NHS Improvement as well as the contact-tracing programme that is under fire for tracking down too few people who have tested positive for the virus.“Given Dido Harding’s track record overseeing the set-up of England’s sub-par test-and-trace system, many people will be worried to hear that she may be given a pivotal new role in the NHS,” said the Liberal Democrat MP Munira Wilson, the party’s health, wellbeing and social care spokesperson.“We need to have total transparency in how appointments of this kind are made, to ensure we get the best people for the job.“Rather than focus on promoting yet another Tory insider, the government would do well to reflect on their handling of this pandemic and launch an independent inquiry to ensure we don’t repeat past mistakes.” Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic\u0026nbsplike the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was – and always will be – central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person.Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street.It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure – originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation.South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine.Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The\u0026nbspWorld Health Organization\u0026nbspsays it should be the “backbone of the response” in every country.Harding will be named as the interim chair of the new institute – a merger between PHE and test and trace – and will steer it through its first few months as it seeks to improve the testing and tracing of people who may have coronavirus. Speaking in central London on Tuesday, Hancock will laud it as a combination of PHE’s expertise and test and trace’s capacity to track down large numbers of carriers and their contacts.“It must be able to operate with full transparency in order to advise the government, inform the public and do its work, which is so vital to the health of the nation.”Another Tory peer, Lord Prior – a former MP and ex-deputy chair of the Tory party – has been the chair of NHS England, which runs the health service, since 2018.Meanwhile, the  also understands that Duncan Selbie – PHE’s chief executive – will become an adviser to the Department of Health and Social Care after losing his job in a shake-up that has been heavily criticised by doctors and public health experts.The Royal Society for Public Health has voiced its concern about the axing of PHE. “We question the timing of an announcement to scrap our national public health agency, in the midst of a global pandemic and before any public inquiry has started, let alone reported,” said Christina Marriott, its chief executive.“We recognise that there have been some serious challenges in terms of our response to Covid-19, including the timing of the lockdown, the ongoing ineffectiveness of tier 2 track and trace and postcode-level data previously not being available to directors of public health,” she added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a00865a4963ac488d7c0f8228f2f363450b4144/0_102_4268_2560/master/4268.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=627cf754afa786f4f9f8dd390907fb69","title":"lewis hamilton says pursuing the 2020 f1 title has been a lonely journey","story":"Lewis Hamilton has described competing in Formula One under coronavirus restrictions as a unique challenge. The paddock has had to adapt to new protocols. Thse have been successful but the limitations on social contact have exacerbated what Hamilton called a “lonely journey”.Hamilton won the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday with a dominant run from pole to flag, finishing 24 seconds in front of the Red Bull of Max Verstappen. Hamilton leads the world championship by 37 points from the Dutch driver.Spain was the sixth race this season, concluding the second triple header of meetings during which drivers remained in social bubbles. Ordinarily Hamilton would travel between races, visit family and pursue his interests in fashion and music. It is a worklife balance the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolf, has highlighted as vital for his driver to deliver such a high level of performance. However, because of coronavirus Hamilton has curtailed his lifestyle and for all the races he has been staying in a motorhome at circuits to minimise any risk of infection.“The journey of an F1 driver in the fight for a championship can often feel like a lonely journey,” he said. “That is magnified this year with having to limit the people in your bubble and moving around. In the past the travelling and other things I found positive, being around friends to find the perfect balance. This year is much harder to implement the other things that keep the balance. This year is a real challenge and test mentally.”The season is set to run to at least 15 races with a full calendar expected to be announced next week, when the triple-header of meetings at Spa, Monza and Mugello commences. When they conclude F1 will have completed nine races in 11 weeks. “I am not seeing my family but I am focused and as driven as ever,” Hamilton said. “It is a marathon not a sprint so I am keeping my head down and know I will enjoy myself a little bit more at the end of the year and can hopefully be with family.”Mercedes have won five of the six races but Hamilton’s teammate, Valtteri Bottas, has only one victory, at the season-opener in Austria. With Mercedes so dominant, Bottas was best placed to challenge Hamilton but he was only third in Spain and third at the previous race at Silverstone. He is 43 points behind Hamilton and has admitted the championship may already be out of reach.“I have no clue actually what the points’ difference is, but it’s way too big,” he said. “I can see again the championship drifting away. Apart from the first race, it’s been pretty bad. There’s not been a weekend that has gone smoothly and without issue, apart from the first one, so a pretty bad season so far. Obviously, that’s disappointing.”MotoGP’s Franco Morbidelli, who was involved in a crash at the Austrian Grand Prix on Sunday, has demanded that riders be held accountable for their actions despite the accident being ruled a racing incident.Morbidelli collided with the rear of Johann Zarco’s Ducati and both riders fortunately emerged unhurt. The accident also almost took out Valentino Rossi and Maverick Viñales.Zarco appeared to move off line while braking to defend against Morbidelli and the latter clearly believes he should have faced sanction. “Braking like this at 300kmh is really having little love for yourself and those you are racing with,” he told Sky Italy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2dd563f6082c200c692a673f3b0aeb1c435e4ca3/183_118_4706_2824/master/4706.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=917cd32c6399249ab96e2d257b9d6165","title":"ronnie o sullivan darkness doubt snooker perfection compelling","story":"Six-times world champion is happier than he has ever been and perhaps the least we owe him is to accept him on his own termsPerhaps it was fitting that it should end on a miscue. Maybe this is just the imagination playing trick shots but for a snooker player widely acclaimed as the greatest of all time, Ronnie O’Sullivan does seem to miscue quite a lot? Certainly more than you’d expect from your average preternatural, life-affirming, once-in-a-generation talent.There was one against Mark Williams at the 2016 Masters that cost him the frame. One against Ali Carter at the Crucible in 2018 that cost him the match. In fact, there are compilations on YouTube: the horrible scrape of the cue, the ball skewing through the air, the horrified gasps of shock from the crowd.And so it was again, against Kyren Wilson on Sunday night: a poor one-sided final about to be crowned with a glorious century break, if only O’Sullivan could pot a tricky last black. “Clunk.” An audience groan. For O’Sullivan, simply a scowl of grim, placid acceptance. As if this had been coming all along. As if he knew it would end like this. “If I must die, I will encounter darkness as a bride, and hug it in mine arms! Now, to collect my sixth world championship and a cheque for £500,000.”Maybe you found this quite a dissonant ending. To me, it was perfect. It was pure Ronnie: beauty tarnished by ugliness, ugliness uplifted by triumph, triumph pursued by fatalism and inevitable talk of retirement. This is why the frequent comparisons with Lionel Messi or Roger Federer, with Picasso or Mozart, have never quite seemed to capture the essence of him. Or why, if he is indeed such an unimpeachable talent, it has taken him seven years to regain the world title.It’s not just about the beauty, or the perfection. It’s not just those irresistible passages of play when he makes the game look so easy he may as well have downloaded it. It’s also the darkness and the doubt, the wandering thoughts, the duelling contradictions, the quiet madness bubbling beneath the surface, the sheer fragility of what you’re seeing. Or, put more simply: you can’t truly appreciate an O’Sullivan break without simultaneously confronting the possibility that at any moment, and for no reason at all, he might miss.Often you will find these contradictions rather glibly expressed as O’Sullivan’s “demons”, a term that only really serves to underline the inadequacy of sport’s mental health vocabulary. As O’Sullivan explains so well in his book Running, the relationship between his profession and his state of mind is frequently far less operatic and far more complex.Sometimes it manifests itself in an overactive imagination, other times in a lapse of concentration. Sometimes it leads him into addiction, other times into ennui, other times – as when he disdainfully tried to smash his way out of a snooker against Mark Selby in the semi-final – into a sort of wilful self-sabotage.“Am I prepared to give blood, sweat and tears?” he said in an interview before the tournament. “No. Would everybody else like to see me give blood, sweat and tears? Probably yes.”For us as onlookers, there is a faintly problematic ring to all this. After all, the greatest part of sport is the part you don’t understand, and O’Sullivan’s thrilling inconsistency and caprice are part of what makes him so compelling to watch. But to what extent is it legitimate to enjoy the spectacle of someone teetering on the precipice? To what extent does O’Sullivan owe us his talent? To what extent is he required to keep practising for hours in dimly lit rooms for our entertainment?There isn’t a right or a wrong answer to this, by the way: it’s simply an acknowledgement that with certain athletes – Nick Kyrgios and Tyson Fury also spring to mind – what is in their best interests and what is in ours are not always in perfect alignment.This is a problem for snooker too, which has long been bracing itself for the day when O’Sullivan finally takes his leave. In a way, snooker has been a victim of its own inexorable rise in standards. A sport in which any of the top 16 can now punish the slightest safety error is one that will inevitably tend to reward the steady percentage players: your Selbys, your Wilsons, your Anthony McGills. Even Judd Trump has to become a wiser, less interesting player to reach the game’s summit.The truth is that in order to thrive as a flawed maverick in the modern game, you need to be at least as talented as O’Sullivan. And as O’Sullivan so tartly pointed out earlier in the tournament, there are few signs that anyone else currently comes close.In the meantime, we still have Ronnie. And for all the usual wild extrapolations – now for Hendry’s record! Sports Personality of the Year! a knighthood! – perhaps the least we owe a man who has provided us with so much pleasure over the years is to accept him on his own terms. He is 44 now, and by all accounts as happy as he’s ever been, with a erse range of interests and a healthier outlook on life.“Everything in moderation” is one of his mottos, from food to exercise to rest to snooker and in that simple phrase lies the secret of his unlikely contentment. Perhaps on reflection, O’Sullivan’s greatest triumph was to conquer the ledger of his own happiness. Perhaps the toughest opponent he ever had to crack was himself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/744a92094b4b7f17c27d4e056bb300e00ec68e1a/0_319_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7251fe82f7e5df7f7499b760aee49cc9","title":"cameron mackintoshs theatre firms to make more than 850 people redundant","story":"Union Bectu said 185 jobs will go at Cameron Mackintosh Ltd and 669 at Delfont MackintoshRedundancies at theatre companies owned by the leading west end producer Sir Cameron Mackintosh are set to total more than 850.It emerged over the weekend that Mackintosh, the producer of shows including Les Misérables and Hamilton, had notified staff of mass redundancies.The company has declined to give any numbers but the entertainment union Bectu said the figure was around 185 for Cameron Mackintosh Ltd and 669 for Delfont Mackintosh.The head of Bectu Philippa Childs said it had included the numbers in its most recent tally of 5,000 job losses across the wider theatre industry, redundancies brought about because of the coronavirus crisis.She said: “The situation has definitely been forced upon the industry by both the pandemic and a government unwilling to understand the disastrous predicament of theatres unable to reopen safely or viably with social distancing restrictions.“The entire industry has been shocked by Cameron Mackintosh’s unwillingness to use the coronavirus job retention scheme in full or deploy resources beyond the furlough months to support his backstage and front of house staff.“Other West End employers have done their utmost to find creative ways to safeguard the livelihoods of their staff and pursue the bigger mission of saving the world class skills and talents critical to the success of theatres up and down the country.“There are extremely limited options for theatre workers to find employment at the moment and we continue to urge employers to take a holistic approach and retain talent wherever they can.”A spokesperson for Cameron Mackintosh Limited and Delfont Mackintosh Theatres said: “It is a very sad time for everyone affected by this thankless situation, one we could never have imagined would have been forced upon the industry.”Mackintosh, who owns eight West End theatres, has previously complained that there had been no “tangible, practical support” from the government “beyond offers to go into debt”.Theatres, performance spaces and concert halls closed in March, and most people in the industry cannot see them reopening fully until 2021.Last month, the government announced a £1.57bn arts recovery package, but that money is primarily aimed at the survival of buildings and organisations – it is not meant to directly save the jobs of workers. Employers say they have a choice: make redundancies or go bankrupt.Ambassador Theatre Group, one of the biggest employers in British theatre, has announced that it will lay off 1,200 casual staff in September. The Southbank Centre and the National Theatre have announced the loss of 400 jobs each."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57a54de45813fdc084ea9a6874a0c9cdc5fb11b3/395_387_4486_2692/master/4486.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=752c41ac3b589ad4bbace1eb80683280","title":"garmin fenix 6 pro solar review the solar powered super watch","story":"An everyday smart sports watch that goes anywhere and tracks everything while lasting a week and charging from the sunGarmin’s latest go-anywhere, do-anything Fenix 6 Pro Solar multi-sport watch recharges from the sun, marking an important step towards the smartwatch you never need to charge.The £739.99 Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar is one of the US firm’s top-of-the-line devices, capable of lasting weeks on a charge and tracking practically any stat you’d want, plus it’s able to guide you out of forests when you’re lost.The watch is available with either a 42 or 47mm case, and in various colours and materials, here reviewed in slate grey with red accents and a 47mm case.By every dimension the Fenix 6 Pro Solar means business. At 15.1mm thick and 47mm across your wrist, it dwarfs most other smartwatches. It doesn’t feel enormous when worn, still fitting under shirt cuffs and doesn’t catch on things.It weighs 62g, which is reasonably light – the smaller Fossil Gen 5 weighs closer to 100g. With the included 23g silicone strap, the watch feels well balanced on the wrist and doesn’t slide around once done up. It is comfortable to wear with plenty of adjustment. The 22mm strap can be swapped out for either a quick-release band made by Garmin or any standard 22mm third-party strap.The 1.3in non-touchscreen is a colour transflective LCD display that is clearly visible in direct sunlight and has a backlight for seeing it in the dark. The screen is protected by scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass 3 DX and is big and clear enough to see at a glance. It is more animated than Garmin’s similar displays on watches such as the Forerunner 245, but isn’t as slick or as good-looking as the OLED screens on most smartwatches.Five physical buttons take care of controls. Most things are quick and easy to do using the up, down, select and back buttons. If you think of it operating a bit like an old-school or retro Nokia, then you get a rough idea of how it works.Scroll up or down from the watch face for a series of customisable widgets. I have smartwatch notifications first, then a series of health stats including heart, stress and sleep, temperature, solar intensity, a series of running performance widgets and so on there are loads to choose from.Each of the buttons has a press-and-hold shortcut too. I have it set so holding the down button opens music controls, up for settings and holding the light button takes you to a rotating bunch of quick settings, including timers, alarms and Garmin Pay.The Fenix 6 Pro Solar is much less dependent on your phone than most smartwatches you don’t even need to pair a phone to set it up.Pairing with the Garmin Connect app enables alerts of calls, texts and other notifications, control of music, and activity syncing, all of which worked great with a variety of phones. The watch has wifi for syncing directly to the internet, downloading updates or music too. It can be plugged into a computer to sync and update via Garmin Express, which is a requirement if you want to update the built-in maps.Sans-phone, the watch will continue to track your vitals and activities for weeks with a large amount of internal storage, including fairly comprehensive analysis. You could head off into the wilderness for a week without a phone and still do everything, including mapping, which can’t be said of most smartwatches.The Fenix 6 Pro Solar lasts at least quadruple the length of most smartwatches between charges. Used just as a smartwatch with phone notifications and all the health tracking features activated it, the watch lasts nine full days and nights between charges. If you cut down on some of the health tracking, such as the pulse oximeter, wrist heart rate or other bits you can extend battery life by days (up to 14 according to Garmin). A power manager allows you to select from various pre-sets or make your own with certain features turned on or off.However, that’s all without employing the watch’s hidden talent – the Power Glass covering the screen doubles as a solar charger. It works all the time, even indoors, but requires bright sunlight to meaningfully top up the battery. On a week where I spent two hours walking (with tracking and maps) and three 25-minute runs on bright British summer days I got an extra day’s battery from general smartwatch usage.The beauty is that, other than the added cost to the watch which is a not-inconsiderable £140 over the version without the solar charging, there’s no downside to the Power Glass as it’s fully transparent to the eye. You just see the screen and a slim strip that looks like bezel.Garmin offers trade-in schemes for some lines and complies with WEEE and other local electronics recycling law.The Fenix 6 Pro Solar has comprehensive health tracking features. An excellent optical heart rate monitor on the back works continuously through the day, alerting you to abnormally high or low beats per minute and recording your resting and active heart rates. It measures Pulse Ox (oxygenation of the blood) both during the day and while asleep, respiration rate, stress, body temperature, fall or incident detection and many more. The only thing it doesn’t have is ECG for tracking heart arrhythmia.Garmin’s body battery system helps you make sense of it all, combining stress, sleep, heart rate variability and other data into a simple in-out system. You charge up your body with good sleep and deplete it with stress, activity and daily life. If you’re about balanced you’re doing a good job, but it’s easy to spot when you’re struggling or not doing enough exercise.Sleep tracking is extensive, including light, deep and REM sleep stages, respiration and Pulse Ox tracking, which together can show signs of issues such as sleep apnoea. The data is presented in easy-to-read graphs on the phone or a widget on the watch.Then there’s your standard step, calories, floors and so on, including move reminders.Comprehensive sport tracking covers a list of over 30 activities, but the main ones are running in its various indoor and outdoor forms, cycling, swimming, walking, hiking, skiing, golf and gym sessions of various activities with on-screen animations showing you how to do them.The watch will handle triathlons, but as a runner I focused on hitting the pavement. The Fenix 6 Pro Solar’s outdoor running tracking was first class. It got a GPS lock within seconds, monitored every stat I could want, had a clearly readable display with only the info I wanted on it, gave me pace and lap alerts, performance analysis after 1.5km and handled intervals and more advanced training plans with aplomb. The watch is noticeably larger and heavier on your wrist than something like the Forerunner 245, requiring me to tighten the strap to stop it sliding around.At the end of each run it gives you an aerobic and anaerobic training score, plus an analysis of your training load over the last seven days. The recovery, Vo2 Max and race predictor functions were more accurate than other Garmin watches I have tested too. PacePro allows you to map out a race course and get pace suggestions in real time on the watch adjusted for elevation and other factors to help you hit your desired time, once races are open again.Walking maps were very useful too, providing maps with trails and other features that weren’t visible on Google Maps, making it more effective than a phone. Moving the map around can be a bit tedious with buttons, but is straightforward with practice.The altimeter, barometer and compass, plus maps of the whole of Europe mean you can go hiking just about anywhere. If you need maps for other regions you can buy them and upload them through Garmin Express.The Fenix 6 Pro Solar can run third-party apps downloaded from the Connect IQ store. There are plenty of small utilities and widgets, apps such as Uber and Strava, music services including Spotify, Deezer and Amazon Music, and buckets of watch faces.The Spotify app works well. It can download up to 2,000 songs for offline playback via wifi or control music on your smartphone. Not many smartwatches have offline Spotify playback, so having it for runs is a big plus for subscribers.Garmin Pay is also available for contactless payment on the go. It is not supported by many banks in the UK, but does support Curve, which allows you to bind most credit or debit cards to it. Payments are secured by pin and could be a lifesaver for use on public transport or buying a drink when running without a phone or credit card.The Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar has an RRP of £739.99 and comes in either 42 or 47mm sizes.The watch is also available without solar charging as the Fenix 6 Pro costing £599.99, with solar charging but without music, maps and wifi, as the Fenix 6 Solar costing £649.99 or in a larger 51mm version called the Fenix 6X Pro Solar costing £849.99.For comparison, the Garmin Forerunner 245 Music costs £299.99, the Forerunner 945 costs £519.99, Suunto 9 Baro costs £539, the Coros Vertix costs $599 (£460), the Polar Vantage V Titan costs £519, the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2 costs £269 and the Apple Watch Series 5 costs £399.The Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar is the do-anything, go-anywhere watch for those that need a smartwatch while stuck to a desk during the day, but then dump everything and go climb a mountain, do a triathlon or simply trek into the middle of nowhere at the weekends. Or aspire to do those things.It is very much the kitchen-sink of multi-sport watches, which means most of it is total overkill if you’re just a runner, just a cyclist, just a swimmer or just looking for a long-lasting smartwatch. But if you do more than one thing, or like the idea of being able to jump out of an aeroplane in the middle of Europe and still find your way home, this is the watch for you.It is really easy to live with and looks the part. A rugged, yet stylish sports watch that states to the outside world: “I do more than just the day job”. Those with smaller wrists will struggle with the 47mm version, but the 42mm version is smaller than many smartwatches.Garmin’s Power Glass offers a glimpse of the solar-powered future. It’s not quite the holy grail of a smartwatch you never have to charge, but made a small but material difference to the battery life. Having to charge it less than once a week is still a killer feature for everything this watch can track and do. It is worth noting you’re paying an extra £140 for the solar-charging technology versus the same watch without it, which is a fair sum.It is certainly not cheap, and definitely overkill for most. But if you want the ultimate outdoor adventure smartwatch, the Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar is it.Pros: tracks everything under the sun, long battery life, solar charging, phone notifications, Garmin Pay, full offline mapping, offline Spotify, Bluetooth, wifi, 100m water resistance, real buttons, accurate GPSCons: expensive, big, limited Garmin Pay bank support, limited smartwatch features compared to Apple WatchWear OSGalaxy Watch, no touchscreen, screen fairly basic compared to the best smartwatches"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3bf431a6dec2bcb21859aa6355446f01e0013f14/0_0_6635_3981/master/6635.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e79f4877e42d71c5da588057fddf453","title":"unspoiled beaches sand dunes great food summer in southern sicily","story":"In the island’s far south-east, locals are making the most of wide sands, buzzy baroque towns – and a lack of foreign touristsHas fear of coronavirus emptied the beaches – or have I chanced upon one of the last unspoiled stretches of coastline in Italy? I am on the sand at Santa Maria del Focallo in southern Sicily. Around me, a few clusters of friends and families are huddled under umbrellas or cooling off in the sea. Dunes coloured green and pink by evergreen shrubs and bougainvillea stretch in both directions: west towards the port town of Pozzallo and east towards Portopalo, Sicily’s most southerly tip, where the Ionian Sea meets the Mediterranean. There’s an end-of-season feel, as if the stragglers are soaking up the final rays of summer. In reality, the season has only just begun.On 4 June, the travel ban between regions in Italy was lifted and beach resorts began reopening, relying heavily on holidaymakers from their own region and hoping to make ends meet despite the new mask-wearing, socially distanced normal. In this particular corner of Sicily, however, finding space to sunbathe at a safe distance has evidently never been an issue. It has endless kilometres of beach free from the privately run lidos that clutter most Italian resorts, with their tightly packed, uniform rows of sunbeds and parasols.“It’s always like this,” says Ettore Lorenzi, a kitesurfing instructor, from the porch of his whitewashed wooden shack overlooking the beach.Ettore runs the Floripa Yoga and Kitesurf  House (doubles from €70) alongside yoga teacher Ameriga Giannone. Just over the road from the beach, it’s a modernist, low-key space, with bold-coloured walls and a lush garden. The vibe is more like a stay with friends than a hotel holiday. I’m barely been there five minutes before Ettore puts a tumbler of red wine in my hand and invites me to join the other guests – either old Sicilian friends or repeat visitors – at a long table on the jasmine-shaded terrazzo for a vegetarian dinner. I quickly realise I could happily spend the week flitting between the beach and the grounds of Floripa.But I have a large unspoiled region to explore and a long list of “unmissable” places to eat at along the coast. Gennaro del Pino, a not terribly busy beach barman, tells me: “Though excellent cooking can be found almost anywhere nearby, A Valata, on the seafront in Pozzallo, 8km away, is where pozzallesi locals choose to dine.” And so off I go.Unlike the beach, A Valata is rammed. Part-suspended on wooden decking, the restaurant hangs over now-obsolete concrete tracks that used to guide boats into the water. “The kitchen was formerly a boathouse,” the restaurant’s owner says. “It was one man’s job to row out across the bay to the lighthouse to top up the lamps with oil each night.” Now succulent platters of house speciality pesce crudo – Sicily’s answer to sashimi – fly out of the former boathouse kitchen. Michael La Pira, who works as a waiter in summer and in the merchant navy in winter, says the fish is brought in daily on small boats that have been the bedrock of this local economy for centuries.On the table next to me, a young woman finishes a huge portion of linguine with fresh tomatoes and sardines. “Tourism is surplus to fishing and agriculture here,” says Erika Modica, whose choice of dish reflects the two pillars of the area’s economy. Erika runs a boat chartering business, and appears unfazed by the impact of coronavirus. “We live very much in the present here,” she says. “We are happy people.”Indeed, as I walk back through the town to the car, a heady atmosphere prevails as locals pack the boardwalk enjoying their evening passeggiata. The only sign of a pandemic is the odd mask slung over an elbow, to be worn when entering a bar or shop. Holidays are still happening here, just without the influx of foreign tourists.In the opposite direction to Pozzallo, east along dusty roads flanked by polytunnels growing Pachino tomatoes, is Portopalo di Capo Passero. Once the centre of the tuna trade, and now on the verge of being run-down, it feels real, compared with touristy Marzamemi further up the coast. Not far away, off Italy’s southernmost tip, Isola delle Correnti is a tiny island just above sea level, with a 200-year-old octagonal stone lighthouse. It’s an ideal swimming spot, and groups of friends clutching lilos are wading out through the shallow water to swim in the small coves.Staying on shore and in the shade, I chat to a family on holiday from Emilia-Romagna, the first non-Sicilians I come across during my stay. “We were lucky to have booked our flights in January because now they are expensive,” says Sabrina Corbino, as she tucks into scaccia – a traditional layered pizza-pie filled with tomatoes and aubergine. She blames the airlines for the lack of tourists – including Italians – though she admits she already knew the area through having family here.Inland, the hilltop towns built in Sicilian baroque style offer a side helping of sophistication. I enjoy an aperitivo in the chic town of Noto, but nearby Modica and Scicli are equally beguiling. Noto’s architecture is high baroque, and the pale stone reflects the sun in ever-changing pink hues on the wide cobbled streets. In Cássaro Cafè-Bistrot on the main drag, two friends have a drink at the table next to mine. They are a fashion PR and a stylist who moved from Milan several years ago to transform an 18th-century apartment into a B\u0026ampB. “This is the type of place where you could be standing next to a famous film director in the queue for an ice-cream and no one would even realise,” says Edoardo Marchiori as he sips his margarita. “Those in the know come here to get away from the crowds.”Back at Floripa, the other guests are baffled by my decision to skip the daily yoga classes, but with such a seductive and unpretentious corner of Sicily on the doorstep, yoga is going to have to wait.• Car rental was provided by Avis (from €200 per week)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b767fa4d2895caf745aeebdb97a5133ed549d10b/0_240_3600_2160/master/3600.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1c793e7e95526ca50a32a8eb340f92e","title":"lovecraft country review are people scarier than monsters","story":"Thrilling action-adventure is the first priority of this new HP Lovecraft-inspired drama, but its prescient message about racism is never far from the surfaceWhat would HP Lovecraft (1890-1937) have made of Lovecraft Country (Sky Atlantic)? While the epic new sci-fi-fantasy-horror-drama bears his name and invokes his trademark eldritch monstrosities, I suspect that Lovecraft himself wouldn’t have made it past the opening titles. Not because Lovecraft Country isn’t good television – it’s great television – but because, as well as being a hugely influential pulp fiction author, Lovecraft was a notorious racist. Lovecraft Country, meanwhile, is a beautiful bounty of black creativity and black history. It is protest art, just when the world needs it most.In the US in the mid-50s, Korean war veteran Atticus “Tic” Freeman (Jonathan Majors of Da 5 Bloods and The Last Black Man in San Francisco) is travelling north from Florida to his family’s home on the South Side of Chicago. Asleep on the bus, he has garish dreams of shooting at flying saucers and slime-dripping aliens, but waking life in the Jim Crow era is hardly less nightmarish, whichever side of the Mason-Dixon Line you find yourself on.Tic is on the trail of his missing father, Montrose (Michael K Williams), who was last heard from in the area of Massachusetts known as Lovecraft Country because of its association with the author. So, after regrouping in his old neighbourhood, that’s the direction Tic sets off in, accompanied by his Uncle George (Courtney B Vance), a fellow pulp fiction fan and author of Green Book-style safety guides for black travellers and Letitia (Jurnee Smollett), a childhood friend with a rebellious streak.It’s when the trio set out on the road – through the rural midwest heartlands, en route to the nation’s historical colonial settlements – that this show’s phenomenal world-building really comes into its own. The visual effects and monster scares are as high spec as you would expect from a show which boasts The Force Awakens’ JJ Abrams as an executive producer. But it’s in the seemingly innocuous period details, and the influence of another executive producer, Get Out’s Jordan Peele, that the true horror lurks. When, for instance, they pull out of a gas station to avoid the racist mockery of a teenager, a billboard using “mammy” imagery to advertise Aunt Jemima’s Pancakes is revealed it’s insidious and inescapable.Then there’s Lydia’s, a diner that George is considering for inclusion in his guide, after receiving a tip about it. It’s supposed to be welcoming to black clientele, but something seems off when they walk in – maybe it’s under new management? and it’s not until Tic notices the freshly painted walls that the situation becomes clear. “Uncle George, remind me why the White House is white?” he says. “They had to paint it white to cover up the burn marks,” George tells him, just as Letitia comes screaming out of the bathroom and a mob of locals armed with shotguns comes careening round the corner. This sets up Lovecraft Country’s priorities nicely: expect thrilling action-adventure as the first order of business, but there is historical insight here, too, if you pay attention.It’s also got heart. Like Buffy the Vampire Slayer before it, Lovecraft Country is fantastical horror, grounded in emotionally intelligent family drama. Letitia has a difficult relationship with her older sister Ruby (Wunmi Mosaku), and, for reasons as yet unexplained, didn’t make it home for their mother’s funeral. Tic can’t forgive his alcoholic father for the physical abuse he suffered as a child, even though, as Uncle George points out, Montrose had a difficult childhood, too. Their traumas were first inflicted many years, if not many generations, back but the wound is still red-raw. Or, as Montrose put it in his cryptic letter to his son: “You think that you can forget the past you can’t. The past is a living thing, you own it, owe it.”For all of TV’s worthy engagements with Black Lives Matter – the Fox miniseries Shots Fired, episodes of The Good Wife and Scandal – this show, which isn’t even addressing the movement directly, seems to speak to it most meaningfully. It’s no coincidence that Lovecraft Country is also the most entertaining series to grace our screens for months. Showrunner Misha Green knows how to find the joy in the moment – or in the pages of a good pulp novel – without denying the historical context. Perhaps even a blinkered bigot like Lovecraft would have come to admire that eventually."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a65dab0482d566122bc9aa21fc56355dd237d0bb/0_336_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99e6071095383da3ace2a67a42585ac2","title":"iran bounties us troops afghanistan taliban","story":"Iran is reported to have paid bounties to a Taliban faction for killing US and coalition troops in Afghanistan, leading to six attacks last year including a suicide bombing at the US airbase in Bagram.According to CNN, US intelligence assessed that Iran paid the bounties to the Haqqani network, for the Bagram attack on 11 December, which killed two civilians and injured more than 70 others, including two Americans.The Pentagon decided not to take retaliatory action in the hope of preserving a peace deal the Trump administration agreed with the Taliban in February, the CNN report said. In January, less than a month after the Bagram attack, the US killed the Iranian Revolutionary Guard general Qassem Suleimani, in a drone strike in Baghdad, but that attack is not thought to have been a direct retaliation for Bagram.“The Department of Defense does not disclose timelines or discussions surrounding internal deliberations and intelligence briefings. With that being said, the department has repeatedly demanded, both publicly and privately, that Iran cease its scourge of malign and destabilizing behavior throughout the Middle East and the world,” a Pentagon spokesman, Maj Rob Lodewick, said.“While the United States, its Nato allies and coalition partners are working to facilitate an end to 19 years of bloodshed, Iran’s inimical influence seeks to undermine the Afghan peace process and foster a continuation of violence and instability.”The report comes nearly two months after allegations that Russia was paying bounties to Taliban fighters for killing Americans in Afghanistan. Donald Trump rejected those reports as a “hoax”, but the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, confirmed he warned his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, that there would be “an enormous price to pay” if Moscow was paying such bounties. The Pentagon has said it will investigate the reports of Russian bounties but has so far not produced a conclusion to that investigation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd12065be18b5bed28c82fba0d398b12eede523c/75_552_5280_3168/master/5280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7c42c8f856212d8321d48f640b87c819","title":"global report alarm over covid case rates 19 european countries","story":"Countries cross threshold for cumulative 14-day totals, with Spain particularly worrying Nineteen European countries have crossed a key threshold of new coronavirus infections, with Spain’s figures particularly worrying.According to data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the countries have recorded cumulative 14-day infection totals higher than 20 per 100,000 inhabitants, considered an early alarm level by many health experts.Luxembourg and Spain have reported more than 100 new cases per 100,000 people in the past two weeks, the figures show, with Malta recording more than 80, Belgium more than 60, and France and the Netherlands more than 40. The UK has 20.7.Spain reported on Monday a total of 1,833 new infections in the past 24 hours, bringing its seven-day total to 32,329. The daily figure provided by the health ministry was lower than Friday’s post-lockdown record of 2,987, but infection statistics in many European countries often dip on Mondays due to diagnosis and reporting delays on Sunday.Four more Spanish regions imposed new laws intended to curb the spread of the virus, including closing nightclubs and obliging bars and restaurants to shut by 1am, joining two that began applying the measures – which also include limits on visits to retirement homes – on Sunday.The northern Basque region on Monday declared a health emergency, allowing it to impose even tougher restrictions because of the risk of what authorities described as a “tsunami” of infections.In total, 59,162 cases have been detected across Spain in the past two weeks, leading public health experts to warn the country is in a critical moment in its battle against the virus.Last week nine scientific organisations published a joint letter warning that the recent surge in cases could risk a “collapse” of the country’s healthcare system. “If the situation continues and new measures are not adopted, there is a high probability that we will again face the situation seen during the state of alarm,” it noted.Health officials have played down these fears, pointing to the fact that the majority of cases being detected are among people under 65 years old. As a result, they said, the number of deaths remained relatively low at 54 in the past week.In Germany, which announced a comparatively low 561 new cases on Monday, the health minister said large gatherings and celebrations were the main source of new cases.Weddings would be under threat if numbers continued to rise, Jens Spahn said, adding that while returning holidaymakers accounted for many new cases, domestic outbreaks were just as significant. Big parties could “spread the virus very, very fast”, he said.In France, where Monday’s new infections figure was 493, also well down on the 3,000-plus reported on the two previous days, a government spokesman said riot police would be dispatched to Marseille, which along with the greater Paris area was this weekend classed as a Covid-19 “red zone” to ensure stricter rules on mask-wearing and social distancing were observed.The Île-de-France region around the French capital also announced tougher measures in care homes, including mandatory tests for all new care home workers and residents as well as those returning from holiday.The French public health agency described the situation as “preoccupying”, adding that “all indicators continue to progress and the transmission of the virus is accelerating”. It said all age groups were affected but most particularly young adults, and most infections were taking place outside of recognised clusters.A historical theme park, the Puy du Fou, drew a storm of protest on social media after the local prefecture allowed it to organise an event attended by 9,000 people, far exceeding a government limit on gatherings of more than 5,000.Opposition politicians and workers in France’s otherwise stricken arts sector said the park’s owner, a former conservative cabinet minister and friend of President Emmanuel Macron, had benefited from special favour. The culture minister, Roselyne Bachelot, denied this, saying the park had followed distancing requirements.The Czech Republic, which has so far reported about 20,000 cases in total and 397 deaths, said face masks would be compulsory again from 1 September on public transport and in many indoor public venues because of a resurgence of infections.The country was among the first in Europe to order people to wear masks in most public places in March, but lifted the requirement when infections fell.“We consider this to be a preventative measure given that we are probably facing a complicated autumn, especially after 1 September when there will be high social interaction,” the health minister, Adam Vojtěch, said on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ee83c99d70e6f54a5898fb0e395a3b94b9f95ae/0_8_5472_3286/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3574f0b8d7562abda0552bd790efe3e5","title":"israel and uae open phone link after historic deal","story":"Connection of phone service represents the first concrete sign of the agreement made last week to establish diplomatic ties A telephone service between the United Arab Emirates and Israel has begun working as the two countries opened diplomatic ties, part of a deal brokered by the US that required Israel to suspend its contentious plan to annex the West Bank.UAE foreign minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan called his Israeli counterpart, Gabi Ashkenazi, in what Israel hailed as an important step.Congratulating the UAE on “removing the blocks”, Israeli communications minister Yoaz Handel issued a statement on Sunday saying: “Many economic opportunities will open now, and these trust-building steps are an important step toward advancing states’ interests.”Associated Press journalists in Jerusalem and Dubai were able to call each other from both landline and mobile phones registered to Israel’s country code +972 from around 1.15pm.Also on Sunday, Israeli news websites that had previously been blocked by UAE authorities, such as the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post and YNet, could be accessed without using means to bypass internet filtering in the Emirates.In the UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, a recorded message in Arabic and English would typically play prior to Sunday saying calls to +972 numbers could not be connected. The advent of internet calling allowed people to get around the ban, although these too were often interrupted.Some in Israel used Palestinian mobile phones with +970 numbers, which those in the UAE could call.The connection of phone service represents the first concrete sign of the deal between the Emiratis and Israelis.Israel and the UAE announced on Thursday they were establishing full diplomatic relations in the US-brokered accord.The historic deal delivered a foreign policy victory to President Donald Trump as he seeks re-election and reflected a changing Middle East in which shared concerns about arch enemy Iran have largely overtaken traditional Arab support for the Palestinians.Palestinians say it puts a just resolution of the Middle East conflict even farther out of reach by undermining an Arab consensus that recognition of Israel only come in return for concessions in peace talks. That removes a rare source of leverage for the Palestinians.The agreement will make the UAE the third Arab country, after Egypt and Jordan, to have full, active diplomatic ties with Israel. The UAE and Israel announced it in a joint statement, saying deals between the two countries were expected in the coming weeks in such areas as tourism, direct flights and embassies.Early on Sunday, the Emirates’ state-run WAM news agency announced a UAE company had signed an agreement with an Israeli company for research and study of the coronavirus pandemic.The move has sparked anger among some who see it as a betrayal of longstanding efforts to establish an independent state of Palestinians. In Pakistan, hundreds of Islamists rallied on Sunday to denounce the Emirati-Israeli deal. The Jamaat-e-Islami party chanted slogans against the US and burned effigies of Trump. They also set ablaze American and Israeli flags.The deal also has enraged Iran and Turkey, regional rivals of the UAE.On Sunday, the chief of staff of Iran’s armed forces called the UAE’s decision a “disaster”. Mohammad Hossein Bagheri urged Abu Dhabi to “revise” its position.“If an incident happens in the Persian Gulf and violates the national security of the Islamic Republic of Iran, even a tiny bit, and we see it from the UAE, we will not tolerate it,” Bagheri said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afc6dc939087b954256df74d52d0337e7e9c72c3/0_175_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=786d11069259bb464327fb01587a0c2c","title":"former world leaders call for action to stop lost covid generation","story":"Figures including Tony Blair and Sir John Major say young people shouldn’t be ‘robbed of their education’A group of former world leaders has called for urgent measures to prevent the global health crisis creating a tragic “Covid generation” denied an education.Among the 275-strong group of senior figures are former UK prime ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and Sir John Major, as well as economists, politicians and educationalists from around the world.In a letter addressed to G20 leaders, national governments and global financial institutions, the group call for action to ensure that a generation of young people are not “robbed of their education” due to Covid-19.As countries’ lockdowns come to an end, they warn that as many as 30 million children may never return to school because of the pandemic, according to a Unesco report.They have also raised concerns that the world’s poorest children have been “locked out of learning”, denied internet access and, with the loss of free school meals for pupils across the globe, face the rising threat of hunger. They also state that being in school is the “best defence against forced marriage” for millions of adolescent girls.As part of its proposals, the group suggests that every country should pledge to protect frontline education spending, prioritising the needs of the most disadvantaged children and promoting school participation.It also calls on the international community to increase aid for education, focusing on the most vulnerable, to free up resources for education through debt relief, and for the International Monetary Fund to issue $1.2tn from its global reserve asset towards the countries that need the most support.The letter states: “We write to call for urgent action to address the global education emergency triggered by Covid-19.“With over 1 billion children still out of school because of the lockdown, there is now a real and present danger that the public health crisis will create a Covid generation who lose out on schooling and whose opportunities are permanently damaged.“While the more fortunate have had access to alternatives, the world’s poorest children have been locked out of learning, denied internet access, and with the loss of free school meals – once a lifeline for 300 million boys and girls – hunger has grown.“An immediate concern, as we bring the lockdown to an end, is the fate of an estimated 30 million children who according to Unesco may never return to school.”The letter also highlights the danger of young children being forced into “exploitative and dangerous labour” and progress on gender equity potentially being set back by years.It continues: “We cannot stand by and allow these young people to be robbed of their education and a fair chance in life.” Mary Robinson, the former president of Ireland, and Ban Ki-Moon, former UN secretary general, are also among the signatories."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6fa6babae6b7a87fb56d9a528bfdaaa9f692652f/0_0_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08ac1450f0b3233739816e820a2b952f","title":"covid 19 climbdowns the uk governments u turns and missteps","story":"Claims of ‘world-beating’ response tarnished by reversals on everything from testing to A-level resultsThe list of U-turns carried out by Boris Johnson’s government in its response to Covid-19 continues to grow. After apparent failures on the contact tracing app, a change of heart on school meals and school opening dates, A-level results becomes the latest issue in the spotlight. Here are of some of its missteps so far:After months of pursuing a £10bn centralised contact-tracing model and hiring more than 18,000 tracers, the government appears to have conceded that a regional approach may be needed to respond to the pandemic. Local authorities had argued for months they had the expertise through their existing public health tracing teams, but it was only in August that the government decided to offer regional teams more support. The changes also mean the axing of 6,000 national call handlers by the end of August.The government was forced to abandon its coronavirus contact-tracing app, which it had been developing for three months and poured millions of pounds into, despite experts repeatedly warning that the app would not work. The health secretary, Matt Hancock, who previously said the app would be ready for nationwide rollout in mid-May after being trialled on the Isle of Wight, explained that the NHS would switch to a decentralised alternative designed by the US tech firms Apple and Google.Boris Johnson announced that the government would be providing food vouchers for some of England’s poorest families after a campaign launched by the footballer Marcus Rashford. It came just 24 hours after No 10 had rejected his plea for it to keep paying for the £15-a-week vouchers over the summer.Prof Neil Ferguson, who was advising the government at the time lockdown was imposed, gave damning testimony that the UK’s Covid-19 death toll could have been halved if the government had introduced the measure a week earlier. Johnson insisted it was premature to make judgments about the government’s approach.The government’s goal was for all primary school children in England to be back in class for a month before the summer holiday. Earlier this month, however,  Williamson admitted that not all children would be able to return before the summer, with some having to wait until September.Johnson announced the government would allow shielding MPs to vote by proxy after an outcry over the treatment of parliamentarians with medical conditions. Those with disabilities said they felt they were being disenfranchised. The leader of the Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, firmly refused to endorse a proxy voting system and that MPs should instead be paired. Within days of Rees-Mogg’s comments, Johnson announced the change at prime minister’s questions.A scheme granting indefinite leave to remain in the UK to relatives of foreign national NHS staff who die from Covid-19 was extended to low-paid workers after their exclusion attracted widespread criticism. The scheme, introduced in April, initially excluded cleaners, porters and social care workers.In the first major U-turn of his premiership, Johnson announced that overseas NHS staff and care workers would no longer have to pay a controversial visa surcharge. He had rejected calls to scrap it at PMQs the day before.A fortnight after stressing that the evidence was weak on the benefits of face coverings, the government changed its advice to say they should be worn in enclosed spaces and on public transport. It later went further, with a new rule imposed on 15 June that anyone travelling on public transport in England must wear a face covering.The government stopped testing in the community on 12 March and retreated to testing principally in hospitals, according to a damning letter MPs sent to Johnson. The science and technology committee wrote in May that the consequences had been that care home residents and carers could not be tested “at a time when the spread of the virus was at its most rampant”. The government announced plans to rapidly scale up testing at the beginning of April, when  Hancock pledged 100,000 tests a day in England by the end of that month."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c8f3171d1871a2f7c2d62fb9aa03340e3624030/0_151_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=54647824790f9179dba25386906e0ea9","title":"coronavirus live news new zealand postpones election italy closes nightclubs","story":"Malta closes down bars and nightclubs 70 workers test positive at UK desserts factory Czech Republic sees resurgence of coronavirus infectionsAustralia’s second most populous state of Victoria has reported 17 deaths from the coronavirus in the last 24 hours, a day after recording its deadliest day of the pandemic with 25 casualties. The state also reported 222 new daily coronavirus cases compared with 282 on Monday, suggesting the six-week, stage-four lockdown in the city of Melbourne is beginning to bend the Covid curve. Panama allowed hair salons, churches, retail shops and car lots to open on Monday after five months of lockdown amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the Associated Press reports.The government also allowed public and private construction projects to resume and nongovernmental organisations to reopen in a bid to restart the teetering economy.There was some question as to how many people were still obeying the quarantine anyway. Traffic jams are once again commonplace and reports of beach visits and parties at the homes of government officials grew more frequent.“I believe we can begin lifting the quarantine and start to go out into the street,” said Dr. Jorge Luis Prospero, former representative of the Pan-American Health Organization in Ecuador and Nicaragua. I base that on the fact that since July 1 we have maintained a relatively stable number of new cases and deaths.As of Sunday, the country reported nearly 82,000 infections and more than 1,700 deaths.As Australia wakes up, here is a summary of the latest developments from the last few hours:That’s it from me, thank you for reading along. I’ll now be handing over to my colleague Alison Rourke.Brazil reported 19,373 new cases of coronavirus and a further 684 deaths in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said on Monday.Brazil has now registered 3,359,570 cases of the virus since the pandemic began, while the official death toll from Covid-19 has risen to 108,536, according to ministry data, marking the world’s worst coronavirus outbreak after the United States. Malta will close its bars and night clubs once again after a surge in coronavirus cases, the health minister Chris Fearne said Monday.The measure, to take effect on Wednesday will also concern sports facilities and social clubs, said Fearne, who is also deputy prime minister.Mass gatherings in public have been restricted to 15 people, while restaurants and shops have been allowed to remain open.Health superintendent Charmaine Gauci said the new “more controlling” measures are aimed at ensuring social distancing.Coronavirus cases have been rising steadily in Malta, seen some months ago as a European success story for its handling of the pandemic.It currently counts 607 active cases of Covid-19 - almost double the peaks it saw in March and April.The surge, which began nearly a month ago, has been traced to a weekend-long party at a hotel and a traditional village religious feast.Malta has recorded a total of 1,375 infections since 7 March, when the first case was detected. Of those, 759 have recovered and nine have died. Two people are currently receiving treatment in intensive care.Meanwhile, Fearne also announced that Malta will introduce a new “amber travel list” of countries whose nationals must present a certificate showing a negative Covid-19 swab test from the previous 72 hours before being allowed entry.The stricter measures were greeted with cautious optimism, with the country’s doctors union backing down from potential industrial action over the government’s handling of the pandemic.The Chilean authorities shut down a mall in downtown Santiago on Monday morning after hundreds of people crowded into the precinct to buy merchandise to sell, just hours after a lockdown for the area was eased.At least 300 people queued outside the Asia Pacific mall, which specialises in selling Chinese-made products, ahead of opening hours and rushed inside as private security guards attempted to dispense alcohol gel and take temperatures, in some cases resulting in physical clashes with shoppers.The mall is situated in the capital’s Central Station, where a strict lockdown over the past three months was eased on Monday morning.Like many Latin nations, Chile has a large population of informal vendors who struggled after movement restrictions reduced their customer base.The reopening of Central Station, along with the adjoining Central Santiago which hosts government offices and business headquarters, passed off largely uneventfully, albeit with larger concentrations of people in reopened shops and on public transport.Around 12 of the Asia Pacific mall’s 70 shops reopened, according to the municipality.Felipe Alessandri, the Santiago mayor, said some stores had offered “irresistible” sales that had attracted shoppers from across the capital’s province. He warned that short-term thinking would see the quarantine reinstated.He told journalists outside the mall as the authorities arrived to close it down:There is now greater freedom, and more responsibility needed, but clearly human stupidity knows no bounds.Isabel Zuniga, the owner of one of stores that reopened, said she had sought to implement an appointment booking system for customers on Facebook, but had been overwhelmed by crowds.It’s understandable because these people are street vendors who haven’t worked for three of four months. They don’t get government support, and they are desperate to restore their businesses and feed their families.More than 70 workers at a desserts factory in Nottinghamshire, England, have tested positive for Covid-19, Nottinghamshire Live reports.A total of 701 workers at Bakkavor have already been tested during the first days of on-site testing at the factory in Newark, with hundreds more to be tested in the coming days.County council staff have worked with management staff at Bakkavor, which employs 1,600 people, to set up the testing after 72 positive cases were registered. The testing facility will run until 19 August so all employees can get tested.Since self-isolating, 33 staff members have returned to work, the authority added.Nigeria will resume international flights on 29 August as it eases restrictions over the coronavirus pandemic, the country’s aviation minister said Monday.Africa’s most populous country shut its airspace in March to contain the spread of the virus that has so far infected 49,068 and claimed 975 lives.Hadi Sirika said on Twitter international flights would first resume in Lagos and Abuja:“Protocols and procedures will be announced in due course,” he said, adding that the country’s other international airports would follow suit.The decision came barely six weeks after the West African economic powerhouse resumed domestic flights.My colleagues Simon Murphy and Kate Proctor have compiled this very handy (and growing) list of some of the UK government’s Covid-19 missteps and U-turns.After apparent failures on the contact tracing app, a change of heart on school meals and school opening dates, A-level results became the latest issue in the spotlight. You can read the full list here:Oman will allow the reopening of tourist and international restaurants from Tuesday, as well as gyms and swimming pools located in hotels, under certain regulations and requirements.The country’s ministry of tourism said that the supreme committee for dealing with Covid-19 approved the reopening.The supreme committee had also announced the ending of the ban on night movement as of Saturday.Oman has recorded 83,226 coronavirus cases, including 588 deaths and 77,812 recoveries.The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) said on Monday that mink at two farms in Utah tested positive for coronavirus, the first such confirmed cases in the animal in the country.People who had contact with the animals have also tested positive for the virus, which causes Covid-19 in humans, the agency said. It added that tests were carried out after unusually large numbers of mink died at the farms.The animal, which is bred for its fur, is known to be susceptible to Sars-CoV-2, the agency said, after mink carrying the virus were found on four of the 155 farms in the Netherlands.Two cats in New York became the first pets in the United States in April to have contracted the coronavirus, although there is no evidence of pets spreading the virus to humans. The USDA said there was currently no evidence that animals, including mink, play a significant role in spreading the virus to human.Limited information shows low risk of coronavirus spread to humans from animals, but more information is needed to determine if animals could play a role in the spread of the virus, the agency added.Pool parties and party boats are set to be banned in Mallorca and Ibiza, as Spain’s Balearic islands grapple with a surge of coronavirus cases.Some two months after opening its door to tourists, the region has gone from registering a handful of new cases each day to an average of 100 daily cases in the past two weeks.Starting on Tuesday the region will implement the measures being rolled out across Spain, including shuttering restaurants and bars at 1am and banning smoking in public places when distancing isn’t possible, said regional leader Francina Armengol. But it would also go further in cracking down on activities such as party boats and pool parties across the region, she said. “There are young people and people of all ages who are contracting the virus,” Armengol told reporters. “Everybody is at risk.” Her government has taken a hard line in its battle against the virus, with fines ranging from €100 (£90) for going maskless and up to €600,000 for those caught organising illegal parties. In July, after footage emerged of tourists partying in the streets while flouting rules on masks and social distancing, the government responded with a two-month closure of shops, bars and restaurants on Magaluf’s main strip and two other party streets in Mallorca that are popular with German tourists.Still, the number of cases in the region has continued to climb, resulting in a 14-day infection rate of 145 per 100,000, according to the latest figures from Spain’s health ministry. Turkey’s total number of coronavirus cases rose to more than 250,000, with 1,233 new cases identified in the past 24 hours, health ministry data showed on Monday, as the death toll neared 6,000.The data showed 22 people had died in the past 24 hours in Turkey, bringing the death toll to 5,996, while the total number of recoveries rose to 231,971.Reuters reports that France recorded a further 493 Covid-19 infections over the past 24 hours on Monday, sharply down from a caseload of above 3,000 each on the two previous days, but hospitalisations for the respiratory disease rose for a third day in a row.New case figures published on Mondays have consistently been lower than weekend tallies since the start of the outbreak as fewer coronavirus tests are conducted on Sundays, so the dip in infections does not necessarily signal a change of trend.The seven-day moving average of new infections, which smoothes out reporting irregularities, stood at 2,322, above the 2,000 threshold for the fourth day in a row – a sequence unseen since 20 April, when France was in the midst of one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns to contain the spread of the virus.France’s cumulative total of infections has reached 219,029.With infections increasing anew, French authorities are scrambling to avoid a second, economically damaging nationwide lockdown. The government is set to propose on Tuesday that masks be worn in shared indoor workspaces while Paris and Marseille, France’s two biggest cities again declared “red zones” of infection, have expanded areas where mask-wearing is mandatory.Since the beginning of August, Covid-19 cases have increased by 1,830 on an average daily basis, a figure two-and-a-half times higher than July’s average, and also higher than the 1,678 figure in March, when the spread of the virus was accelerating.After consistent declines since a 14 April peak of 32,292, the number of people hospitalised for the disease rose by 65 to 4,925, after a rise of 3 on Sunday and 29 on Saturday. And the number of people treated in intensive care units (ICU) has increased by 17 over the last three days to 384.That ICU figure reached a peak of 7,148 on 8 April, when the French health system was on the brink of breakdown.Coronavirus-related deaths were up by 19 on Monday to 30,429, after an increase of four over the weekend.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Monday said the number of deaths due to coronavirus had risen by 654 to 169,350 and reported 5,382,125 cases. That is an increase of 41,893 cases from its previous count.The CDC reported its tally of cases of Covid-19 as of 4pm ET on 16 August versus its previous report released on Sunday.The CDC figures do not necessarily reflect cases reported by inidual states.Here’s a summary of the day’s developments so far.That’s all from me. My colleague Lucy Campbell will be taking over shortly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0958b753c954b9e27597842d13716e3f9bc0782d/0_487_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3f7e73ff232da16b050f3f700d1a99fd","title":"this is our future how eight talented young creatives found their voice","story":"Full of ideas and uncompromising about the world they want to live in, eight exceptional iniduals have come together to have their say, their way“It’s tough starting from the bottom and trying to work your way up,” says illustrator Chris Martin. The 22-year-old from Milnthorpe in Cumbria is passionate about illustration, but also wants to stay true to his ideals about the type of work he aims to produce, rooted in skate culture. “The prospect of having my work published nationally felt so distant,” he says. But Chris’s work, along with that of seven other young creatives, will appear next Saturday, 27 June, in a supplement published with .Your Voice. Your Way is being created by young people aged between 18 and 25 from across Britain who feel strongly that they and their contemporaries need to be heard when it comes to shaping the future. “I am driven to uncover how our world is steered,” says Chris. “And how, not just as creatives, but as people, we can change it.” Commissioned by Levi’s and  Labs team, the magazine aims to give a platform to the unheard, and amplify their voices.“Their generation has what I’d call a positive stubbornness,” says Jason Kyriacou, the UK marketing and experience director for Levi’s. “An uncompromising attitude to what they believe in and the courage to act on it.”Now, that attitude is needed more than ever. When  Labs and Levi’s started recruiting for the project, in the first months of 2020, issues surrounding climate change, shifting identities and inclusiveness came up in nearly every application. What gave the project even more urgency was the outbreak of Covid-19.Suddenly the future was ever more uncertain, and the assembled contributors – all with little or no media experience – had to adjust to working on the project remotely and contacting their mentors from  Labs using video meetings.Writer Kiera Moran, 24, has had the unusual experience of self-isolating before, and writes about the experience of seeing her five-year-old son through cancer. She started writing up late at night, caring for her child. “Sleep deprived at 5am, I have spilled my heart out,” says Kiera, from Merthyr Tydfil. “My voice is honest and unassuming. Coming from a working class background, I feel I am familiar and welcoming, with a story hidden behind nightmares. I was excited to have such an amazing opportunity. I hope to develop my writing and use what I’ve learned in future work.”Another writer, Anna Marshall, 21, from Durham, drew on her experience in climate activism for the project. “I want to contribute to a fresher and more daring version of professional journalism,” she says. “I was buzzed to see what we could make together,” she says. “And I was excited to work with talented people who are dedicated to what they do.”For the other two writers, Ayat Mohamed, 18, from London, and Sam Carrick, also 18 and from Gosport, the project was a chance to think about their place in the world and how they and others are viewed. “I hope someone reads it and feels understood,” says Ayat.Illustrator Vicki Jones, 21, from Birmingham, was keen for her work to be seen by the people she depicts, often women of colour. “The message I’d like people to take from my work is to be proud of who you are regardless of skin colour, facial features or hair type,” she says. “To just love the way you look. I am passionate about this message and I want others to feel that they can be heard too.”For the two photographers, Milli Ahern, 23, from London, and Fanny Beckman, 25, lockdown meant the biggest adjustment, forcing them to think creatively about what they could shoot in and around their homes, and they responded with positivity. “I was beyond excited when I found out I was chosen to work on this zine,” says Fanny, who is from Malmö, Sweden, but lives in London. “To get advice from people in the industry I have always dreamed of being part of means a lot to me.”“We received hundreds and hundreds of applications,” says the project’s casting editor Anna Fielding. “Every single person who applied had something important to say. The eight collaborators have exceptional clarity of expression and a real drive to see a new world. They’ve been inspirational to work with.”Although it has never been easier to self-publish work, or create a social media presence or a podcast, it’s difficult to be heard among so many others doing the same.The reach of an established newspaper still matters, as does being heard by an audience beyond your peer group.  Labs and Levi’s were happy to turn over creative control and act as supporters and signal-boosters. The hope is that the conviction and passion displayed by these eight will inspire others to find their voices. The collaborators were paid for their time and work, and will be mentored for six months by  Labs staff.Beyond encouraging young people to speak out and push for positive change, the aim is to let the world see the power of their potential. “We want to create a platform that this team perhaps otherwise wouldn’t have had. And then to put it in front of people who might not otherwise read it, because it would have been in places they wouldn’t normally look,” says Jason.The team may be only eight strong, but they represent their generation and they represent Britain.

Other stereotypes fit me alarmingly well: I think rice is one of God’s greatest creations, I talk too much, I care about my hair too much – which is even worse as nobody outside my household sees it.I also care about climate change, animal exploitation, mental health, respect, feminism and more. I’m multidimensional, and I don’t see myself represented enough.Representation has the power to implant views and stereotypes into mainstream consciousness, for better or for worse. We all need role models and there are lots of us who are being let down.It’s up to all of us to fix that. Starting now. Here, five people reveal how they’re breaking boundaries in race, mental health, body image, religion and age representation ...Malin Andersson“Mental health representation will make us all stronger,” says Malin Andersson, a mental health advocate and TV personality.I talk about grief, depression, body positivity, and domestic violence on my Instagram to open up those conversations. I get about a thousand messages a day from people saying I’ve helped them, so I know I’m raising awareness.Speaking up, especially when you show your vulnerability, can make people feel less alone and encourage them to share their experiences too. The more we talk about mental health issues, the more we take away their shame and stigma. We create space to be ourselves without being scared of what others will think. I hope this will lead to better representation of mental health issues.Dr Fatumina Said Abukar“I experienced racism because of a lack of representation,” says Dr Fatumina Said Abukar, an award-winning UCL scientist, model and Stem ersity advocate.I grew up in a small village where my family were the only people of colour, and I experienced a lot of racism.People threw eggs at me and beat me up, and I faced racial slurs. I’m frustrated when I walk into ersity shoots and I’m the only person of colour. When you only have one token figure it’s impossible for them to represent their whole community. This can lead to them being attacked by their own community if they do or say something wrong. I want to see different types of beauty in the media.Stephanie Yeboah“If I’d seen someone who looked like me, I would’ve had less self-hate issues,” says body positivity blogger Stephanie Yeboah.“I grew up feeling uncomfortable in my own skin. I’ve always been into fashion, but I felt like I had to hide that because there were few plus-size-friendly shops. I hated myself and dieted constantly. After university, I went to New York and met a group of women who were all bigger than me – yet confident and effervescent. Inspired, I posted a full-length picture of myself on social media.I was shocked at how positive people were. This generation is so lucky to have role models like Lizzo – I would’ve had less self-hate issues if I’d seen her when I was growing up. The body positive movement was created to celebrate women whose bodies aren’t seen by society as beautiful, so I’d like to see more variety of body shapes in the media.Zaynab Shaikh“Muslim women need better representation in fashion,” says hijabi model Zaynab Shaikh.Muslim women aren’t represented enough. Take fashion: few fashion brands care about Muslim women who want to dress modestly. Shopping is difficult because everything is too tight, sheer or has cut-outs. Just: no.Now, young people ask me how they can start modelling, which is so nice because when I grew up I only saw Muslim women on Arabic channels.Zahra Mohamed“Young people deserve people who look like them,” says Zahra Mohamed, Ayat’s 15-year-old sister.Representation affects young people and the adults we become. I have an issue with adult actors playing teens on screen as they create unrealistic expectations of how we should look, which has led to a rise in eating disorders, depression and anxiety.I like TikTok because it’s full of normal people. Instagram is full of heavily filtered influencers who I can’t relate to. It’s not fair that teens have to obsess over their appearance. Let young people enjoy being teenagers so we can enjoy adulthood.If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this article, the people featured recommend these Instagram accounts: @bodyposipanda @i_weigh @mattzhaig @crazyheadcomics @muslimgirl @the_indian_feminist @privtoprog @Ayat_Zaman"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332609.1597702912!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tender process for six higher education buildings due immediately","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe projects are located in the TU Dublin Tallaght and Blanchardstown (above) campuses in Cork IT and IT Tralee in the Institute of Art, Design and Technology, Dún Laoghaire and in Athlone Institute of Technology. File photograph: itb.ieA programme for the construction of six higher education buildings has progressed and will go out to tender “immediately”, the Department of Higher Education has said.Under Project Ireland 2040, the Government has pledged to deliver 11 higher education buildings across the country, which will facilitate an additional 8,000 student places upon completion.The tender for the first bundle under this Public Private Partnership (PPP) programme – which includes six projects in the eastern and southern regions and in the midlands – will proceed to tender immediately.Following a “pre-qualification process”, three construction companies have been shortlisted and are invited to tender for the bundle. The shortlisted companies are BAM Building Ltd, JJ Rhatigan and John Sisk \u0026amp Son.Announcing the progress, Minister for Higher Education Simon Harris said it is a “key milestone” in a “very ambitious programme of investment”. Essential role“Such investment has never been more important. The higher education sector, and within that our new Technological Universities and our Institutes of Technology, have an essential role to play in driving recovery across Ireland’s regions and in preparing for the opportunities and challenges of a changing economy,” Mr Harris said.The buildings will have “a strong focus” on supporting practice-based learning, including laboratories, workshops and studios, he said. “They will also have significant flexibility to adapt to changing teaching and learning needs, and to support hybrid and remote learning,” he added.The second bundle of five projects includes investments in the southeast, west and in northwest, and is expected to go to tender in early 2021, the department added.The projects are located in Waterford IT and IT Carlow, which are part of the consortium seeking to establish a technological university for the southeast in Galway-Mayo IT and Letterkenny IT, which are part of the Connacht Ulster Alliance and in Limerick IT, which has formed a consortium with Athlone IT. The department said it is envisaged the PPP will operate on a Design, Build, Finance and Maintain (DBFM) contract. The successful tenderer for each of the bundles will construct the buildings using private finance, and will then operate and maintain the buildings over a period of 25 years. Payment by the department will be by way of monthly unitary charge payments over the 25-year operational period, which will start when construction has been completed, the department added."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 target"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

About 28,000 people in receipt of the Pandemic Unemployment Payment will receive no benefit from tomorrow, after failing to confirm their continued eligibility for the scheme, the Department of Social Protection has said.The number of people claiming the payment fell to 232,400 this week, a decrease of 61 per cent from the peak of 598,000 in early May. The scheme, which provides €350 per week for most recipients, was introduced in March to aid those who lost their jobs as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.In recent weeks, the department had contacted around 390,000 PUP claimants asking them to confirm their continuing eligibility for the payment.At the beginning of last week, about 29,000 had not confirmed their continued eligibility “despite having received personal notifications on four separate occasions” up to August 9th, the department said.By Friday, August 14th, about 1,000 confirmed their eligibility for the PUP, and they will continue to receive their payment. The remaining 28,000 will not receive a payment as their PUP claim is now deemed closed. However, anybody who is eligible but did not confirm their eligibility by the deadline can have their payment restored by re-applying online.Minister for Social Protection Heather Humphreys, said the payment continues to be a “vital source of income” for thousands of iniduals and families.“Our resources are not unlimited and we need to ensure that this money goes to the people and families who genuinely need it,” Minister Humphreys said.“My Department has made every effort to contact every person receiving the payment in recent weeks in order to confirm their continued eligibility. The vast, vast majority of people responded and will continue to receive their payment as normal.”On Monday, the Department of Social Protection issued payments valued at €72.2m to 232,400 people for the PUP, representing a decrease of 30,100 on the 262,500 people paid last week.The top three sectors in which employees are returning to work this week are accommodation and food services wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles and construction.The largest cohort returning to work is in the under 25 age group, the department said.Of those receiving the PUP this week, 61,750 will receive the lower rate of €203, based on their pre-pandemic earnings being below €200, while the majority (170,650) will continue to receive the higher rate of €350.

He also criticised the rationale for local lockdowns and travel restrictions.Labour TD for Fingal and Committee member Duncan Smith said he did not think the use of the word hysteria was “helpful”. “People are still cautious and concerned and feeling their way through the pandemic. The use of that word is something I would have a big difference with him on,” Mr Smith said, adding that he thought Mr McNamara had been “very good” as committee chair so far. Sinn Féin health spokesman David Cullinane, who is also on the committee, said it would be “dangerous” to second guess scientific or medical advice. Mr McNamara said on RTÉ that he saw “no scientific or evidential basis” for the ongoing closure of pubs and some other businesses, and that he did not “understand the scientific basis for the decision to shut down Offaly, Laois and Kildare”.While Mr Cullinane said it was reasonable for the chair to have his own opinion, he added: “I don’t think the response has been hysterical. It’s a dangerous road when politicians start second guessing the sincere advice given by medical and scientific experts.”During his appearance on the show, Mr McNamara also said Irish travel restrictions were more “strict and draconian” than anywhere else in the EU, and suggested the restrictions were due to concerns over the frailty of the Irish health system. “When this whole crisis started we said we would flatten the curve to make sure our health system was not overrun… we successfully did that, now we’re entering into a period of hysteria because cases are rising in Ireland, as they are in every other country in Europe, ” he said. Responding to the criticism, Mr McNamara said he had listened respectfully to all experts who had appeared before the committee. “My views have been informed by those experts but I note that there was not agreement or consensus between them. I have found some scientific and medical arguments more convincing that others... It’s not a matter of second guessing the science when scientists and world-leading medics and academics have widely differing views,” he said. He added that he wanted the Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn to come before the committee “particularly given the apparently unquestioning reliance placed by the Government on his advice and that of Nphet, which he leads.”Fine Gael TD and committee member Jennifer Carroll MacNeill said the State had “seen the benefit of trusting in the science.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"europe avoided uk style exam meltdown","story":"The coronavirus pandemic has massively impacted education and exams across Europe, but nowhere have claims of catastrophe been on a par with those in the UK.While outrage rises over the Government\u0027s handling of this year\u0027s exam results and the appalling chasm between predicted and actual grades, some countries on the continent have bumped up continuous assessment marks while others have stuck to traditional exams despite the health risks.In France, the end-of-year exam known as the baccalauréat or Bac, equivalent to A-levels, was cancelled this year for the first time since its inception in 1808 under Napoleon.Instead, the country\u0027s 740,000 final-year students received an average score in each subject, based on marks they had been awarded for tests and coursework during the year.Local juries were tasked with assessing, and if necessary adjusting, grades according to a national average and on the past examination records of schools. Marks obtained during the lockdown period were not taken into account.Jean-Michel Blanquer, the French education minister, called the system “the most simple, secure and fair solution in these difficult times”.This has forced the French government to create about 10,000 extra university places for the most popular subjects. Jean Castex, the prime minister, called the results generous. They marked the highest rise in pass rates since 1968 after huge student strikes ended in marks based on continuous assessment with an 80 per cent success rate - some 20 per cent higher than the previous year.Gilles Roussel, head of France’s university presidents’ conference, CPU, denied the Bac was devalued this year as places were anyway based on marks throughout the previous year and “often the first term”. Students would have to play catch-up on certain subjects, however, he added.In neighbouring Germany, all 16 states decided to push ahead with their end-of-year Abitur qualifications after heated debate.While schools were closed during the March-June exam period, small groups of pupils sat tests at a distance of 1.5 metres in well-aired classrooms instead of halls.Despite the different approach,  most German states also reported higher than usual results. Fears that stress and health concerns could affect performance proved baseless. Indeed, experts speculated that pupils may have been able to focus more due to a lack of distractions.The Netherlands, too, recorded a higher pass rate after its central school-leaving exams were cancelled, with schools awarding final marks on the basis of course work and the schools’ own tests, which pupils were also allowed to resit.While almost five times as many high schools as usual reported a 100 per cent pass rate, according to one survey, the education ministry dismissed claims that the exams had been devalued.“This group of pupils had to take school exams under unexpected and difficult circumstances,” a spokeswoman told the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, adding that the cancellation of the central exams meant pupils had more time to study for the school exams.For Spain\u0027s Selectividad university entrance exams, candidates chose three out of a selection of five questions and were not tested on anything learned during lockdown. Each region was responsible for creating its own coronavirus exam procedure.The pass rate across the country was within one percentage point of 2019, aside from students in northern Catalonia, hard-hit by the virus, where a majority of them did significantly better than in 2019. Some 67 per cent more scored above nine – out of a possible 10 – than in the previous year.In Italy, around 500,000 students took only the oral part of their high-school diploma while wearing face masks but the normal three written tests were cancelled. Marks were generally higher than in previous years amid reports of “generous” examiners who awarded the maximum possible score in 9.9 per cent of cases, compared with just 5.6 per cent in 2019.The Czech Republic and Slovakia postponed end-of-school exams.Sweden, meanwhile, is set to cancel the second round of  its scholastic aptitude tests, which helps many get places at university after scrapping the first round in March.They are likely to be replaced by two exams in 2021 instead, the education ministry said.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rumblings revolution belarus should worry vladimir putin","story":"There can be few world leaders more worried than Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin right now – although Alexander Lukashenko, of Belarus, is one of the few as he is likely to lose his job, and maybe even his freedom, in the days or weeks to come.But for the Russian president, the uncomfortably familiar-looking proto-revolution on the streets of Minsk presents a dilemma.The very worst outcome for Mr Putin (which, incidentally, is the best one for the people of Belarus) is that Mr Lukashenko is swept from power and replaced by a broadly pro-Western leader – or at least one who espouses democracy.That would mean that another neighbouring country slips from what Mr Putin considers should be his rightful grasp, following Georgia and Ukraine. Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Moldova have also undergone quasi-revolutions, although they have followed a less obviously pro-Western path.The seemingly obvious course for Russia, then, would be to attempt to repeat the success of 2014 and intervene. Back then, Mr Putin lopped off one part of Ukraine (Crimea) and has been destabilising parts of its east ever since with catastrophic effects – over 13,000 dead.But Belarus is not so simple, and Mr Putin must know it.Although he is doubtless egged on by some close advisers and parts of the Russian press, he also knows that an intervention, as well as costing money and blood, would also be deeply unpopular in both countries.The Belarussian people are not anti-Russian. However, Russian troops – not known for their sensitivity – on the streets of Minsk and elsewhere would engender the same kind of sentiment that most Ukrainians and Georgians now feel toward Russia.This is why Ukraine and Georgia were not really success stories for Russia at all. It may have gained some soil and infamy, but Russia destroyed any hope of a good neighbourly relationship, not least because that was not its intention.The Kremlin wanted a more of an overlord and underling dynamic, but failed to understand human nature in the process.The regathering of Russian lands gave Mr Putin a steroid boost at home back in 2014. But that would not be the case with Belarus. That trick has a law of diminishing returns. While Belarus\u0027s revolution is unlikely to trigger the same in Russia itself, the thought of it must be in the back of Mr Putin\u0027s mind, if not the front.Mr Putin has never been less popular at home than he is now. Quite apart from the anti-Kremlin protests over the past year of his fifth term, there have, over the past week, been street demonstrations in Russia in support of the Belarusian people\u0027s will.Like Mr Lukashenko, Mr Putin has to resort to increasingly brazen methods to retain his grip on power. But the more blatant the abuse, the more likely (and the more fervent) the popular response.So Mr Putin has a problem. Intervene and it will not go so well for him this time. Leave it alone and the nightmare scenario of a converted and uncontrolled Belarus takes shape.In reality, leaving it alone is not in the Kremlin\u0027s nature. The military option is by no means impossible in this tumult, but a more likely halfway house is for Russia to scale up its non-military involvement.It already feeds Belarus a lifeline of subsidised energy. This will play a part over the next few months. But there will also be a mixture of coercion and ingratiation with Belarus\u0027s new power figures.With several more leaders in post-Soviet countries now moving into 15 or 20-plus year rules (to say nothing of Mr Putin himself, some year 21 years and counting), the pattern of the so-called colour revolutions is set to continue.This is the inevitable consequence of the disappointment of post-Soviet rule and Russia\u0027s still-Soviet mindset.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"waitrose becomes second supermarket ditch bag life","story":"The bag for life backlash has grown as Waitrose became the second supermarket to announce a trial to phase them out.Morrisons announced on Monday that it plans to remove them and replace them with paper carriers, after research suggested that many customers only use them once.The sturdier, thicker versions are more expensive than single-use plastic bags and are supposed to be better for the environment as they will last for longer. But environmental campaigners have pointed out that they use more plastic so could have a greater impact if frequently thrown away.Waitrose said it is planning its own trial before the end of the year with the potential to remove 40 million bags a year when it is extended across all of its stores. A spokesman said it was too soon to give further details.Environmental experts have said that reusable cotton bags or a rucksack are the best option for shoppers, amid concerns that even compostable alternatives could cause confusion.Although many bags are marked as “compostable” this does not always mean they will break down at home as the conditions may not be correct, said Nina Schrank, a plastics campaigner at Greenpeace UK.She added that clearer labelling is needed to make sure that consumers understand how to dispose of them.Friends of the Earth’s plastic campaigner Julian Kirby said that compostable bags can create “an unwelcome new headache” for waste managers.He added: “Ultimately we need to shift away from single-use packaging – whatever the material – and focus instead on reusable products and packaging.”Several British supermarkets said they offer home-compostable carrier bags.Ms Schrank added that paper bags should be treated as a last resort option, as they still require vast quantities of energy to produce.She said: “Our single-use, throwaway society has caused an environmental catastrophe on a global scale.

Among other mysteries, that would help solve the question of how it was able to power itself through such distant space, since pure hydrogen gas would have been able to push it like a rocket.That explanation was useful to the scientists who have spent years puzzled by Oumuamua, after it was first spotted travelling nearly 200,000mph through our solar system in 2017. It sped up as it went on its journey, without any clear explanation, and seemed to behave somewhere between an asteroid and a comet, though it didn\u0027t fit either category and it remains mysterious where it has come from.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut a new paper from researchers at Harvard and the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (KASI) suggest that such an object would not actually have been able to survive the long journey.If it were true, the hydrogen ice theory about Oumuamua would be a major breakthrough in understanding the object. It would explain why it was so strangely shaped – like a long cigar – as well as the non-gravitational acceleration as it sped up on its journey.Scientists perplexed by mysterious alien space rockWe were suspicious that hydrogen icebergs could not survive the journey – which is likely to take hundreds of millions of years – because they evaporate too quickly, and as to whether they could form in molecular clouds, said Avi Loeb, Frank B. Baird Professor of Science at Harvard and a co-author on the paper published in Astrophysical Journal Letters.Among other problems with the theory, the researchers suggested that an iceberg of this kind could not be formed through the usual processes that create solid objects of this kind – sticky dust colliding with each other and gradually accruing into a larger object. That would not work with a hydrogen iceberg, the researchers say.“An accepted route to form a km-sized object is first to form grains of micron-size, then such grains grow by sticky collisions,” said Thiem Hoang, senior researcher in the theoretical astrophysics group at KASI and lead author on the paper. “However, in regions with high gas density, collisional heating by gas collisions can rapidly sublimate the hydrogen mantle on the grains, preventing them from growing further.”Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity.

This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The force said the organiser of the wedding was fined under lockdown legislation.“We understand that the vast majority of people across Greater Manchester are doing the right thing and it’s incredibly disappointing that these people are being continuously let down by a small minority, who are selfishly flouting the very guidance that is there to keep us safe,” said Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling.Manchester police vow to get tough on lockdown breakersGMP said they had received 54 reports of potential breaches of lockdown on Sunday afternoon and evening alone, including several house parties as well as the wedding reception.“We’ve been really open with the public about the pressure these calls place on already stretched and limited resources and I really need people to understand what is at stake here.“Can you imagine a vulnerable loved one not being able to get through to 999 when in an emergency, because our phone lines are tied up with people reporting illegal parties? It’s this serious.”There are, however, signs Greater Manchester’s local lockdown is working.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them. Aren’t they beautiful?Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Any Questions? the A-Level student said she had failed to meet her offer from the Royal Veterinary College, adding: “I have now idea how this has happened.

Several roads were closed and the surrounding area was cordoned off“I feel my life has been completely ruined, I can’t get into any universities with such grades or progress further in my life,” the New College Stamford student said. “I would like to know how this has happened.”In response, Mr Gibb, the schools minister for England, who was also appearing on the programme, said: I do feel for you. This should not have happened to you. We don\u0027t want you to have to go through this stress of having to go through an appeal to find out what’s going to happen to your career.“None of this is satisfactory, the best system is for people to take their exams – that’s what should have happened. It’s what we wanted to happen, but we had to take a very difficult decision in March to cancel exams and what we didn’t want was for young people like Nina to have to delay a year.”Starmer urges government to scrap ‘injustice’ of A-level results“The reason for the standardisation model is to ensure we have consistency between schools and we don’t have grade inflation.”Mr Gibb was then challenged over why the system was not working by BBC presenter Chris Mason, as the student told the minister “you have ruined my life”. But the education minister added: It won\u0027t ruin your life, it will be sorted I can assure you. The trouble with these models – when you have a model that standardises grades across the country there will be imperfections in it.”“That’s why we have introduced very robust appeals processes that schools will trigger for candidates like Nina. Those appeals will happen very swiftly and universities have said they will hold offers open until 7 September and we’re working through that now.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Africa’s forest elephants have been decimated by the illegal wildlife trade, with more than two thirds killed in the last decade. There was estimated to be around 90,000 left, with about half of that population believed to be in Gabon.However, a study by a 10-member international research team fears that the total remaining population could be between 40 to 80 percent smaller. The study, published in PLOS ONE, shows the urgency of The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign, which calls for an international effort to clamp down on the illegal trade of wild animals.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesFunds raised will pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants. This will work to help stop the poaching and illegal trafficking of animalsThe illegal trade of wild animals is the world’s fourth largest criminal enterprise, after arms, drugs and human trafficking.The forest elephant has been ruthlessly hunted by poachers in the rainforests of Democratic Republic of the Congo, Cameroon and Gabon. The ivory is smuggled to Asia where it is in high demand for intricate carving. However the full extent of the bloodshed has been hidden from the world’s gaze.Professor Lee White, Gabon’s Minister of Water, Forests, Oceans, Environment and Climate Change, welcomed The Independent’s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign and said that the world must act now to end wildlife crime, to both protect forest elephants but also for greater global security.“The illegal trade of wildlife wreaks havoc in Africa and even threatens to destabilise whole countries,” White said. “The ivory trade is linked to terrorists and criminal syndicates who also smuggle gold, guns and people at Gabon’s border with Cameroon.”White says some poachers in Gabon “take a ‘shoot on sight’ approach” to confrontation with law enforcers, and have become “much more violent and threatening” in the past five years. “It is partly because we have become more professional and aggressive, but also because there’s now much more involvement of organised crime.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Biological anthropologist Nelson Ting co-led the study, which revised the population size by using a method known as genetic capture-recapture, which involves assessing dung piles. Ting said “Gabon was thought to be a population stronghold, but even our most optimistic results suggest a smaller population size. Our research shows how endangered they really are. “Forest elephants are among the most threatened animals. More information is key to figuring out the best ways to prevent extinction.”Forest elephants are the smaller, rarer cousins of the giant savannah elephant, and their densely wooded habitat makes them harder to study and count.White, a biologist born in Manchester, spent his childhood in Uganda where he developed a passion for elephants. “Tragically, nobody had noticed that Gabon had lost about a third of its forest elephants. You can’t fly over and see the carcasses because they’re hidden”As poachers continued to empty the country of its forest elephants, White spearheaded a war against them - and against ivory trafficking in particular.The threat to forest elephants has been greatly reduced, but danger still looms large. Gabon has maintained its usual level of frontline protection throughout the Covid pandemic in case of any upturn. Elephants can also be killed during conflict with local people, often after trampling or eating crops. Space for Giants is working with the National Parks Agency and Assala Energy over three years to build 23 miles of electrified farm boundary fences to keep elephants from danger, and to protect people’s livelihoods.Several fences have already been completed. These types of projects provide local communities with a sustainable way to earn a living, and are designed to incentivise the communities to help protect their primary source of undeveloped wealth capital, Gabon’s rich bioersity and forest elephants.White was appointed to Gabon’s cabinet by President Ali Bongo Ondimba, whom he calls “one of the planet’s greenest heads of state”, and today he works to not only save forest elephants for their own sake, but to also protect the health of the whole planet.Space for Giants Founder and CEO Dr Max Graham explains: “Forest elephants are incredibly important for the health of our whole ecosystem and in fighting global warming. “They play a role in the dispersal of seeds, which have to go through their gut to germinate, and the unique way in which they forage creates a forest canopy structure that is perfect for carbon sequestration. “They take out the young growth and leave what is longstanding, which has been attributed to creating carbon stock worth billions.”The survival of forest elephants is a human issue, inextricably linked to issues around environment, poverty, law enforcement and finance.White believes that international effort is needed to end the poaching war being waged against Africa, and that wildlife crime needs to become a new global priority in order to protect species and prevent another global pandemic.“If we don’t deal with the illegal wildlife trade we’ll have criminal and terrorist groups rampaging across the continent, destabilising countries,” says White. “But we also cannot continue to aggress nature and think there will be no price to pay. “If we continue to cut down forests, kill animals and destroy ecosystems the consequences will be catastrophic. We must be stewards of nature if we want it to keep being friendly”.Stop the Illegal Wildlife Trade\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Authorities have also been quick to reimpose sweeping local lockdowns on cities affected by only a handful of cases, which has appeared to be effective in preventing any domestic onward transmission.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a particularly cold June morning in northern Kenya when rangers working in Loisaba Nature Conservancy first spotted a large male elephant limping near a watering hole. The rangers began monitoring the elephant, a large bull with enormous tusks, who was nicknamed Alan. Max Silvester, a Conservation Volunteer in Loisaba, said “the injury was likely the result of a botched poaching attempt. Alan had some of the biggest ivory I have seen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesA wounded animal is liable to attack anything that comes close to it, and the elephant charged at the team who assembled to help him. “I was very afraid because he was huge,” said Loisaba’s Security Assistant Rita Orahle, who assisted KWS vet Dr Dominic Mijele.“He was trying to scare us by trumpeting because he knew he could not run away due to his injury”, said Dr Mijele. “I darted him and it became obvious that the wound was caused by a bullet which had entered the animal’s right foot, having first grazed the trunk.“After cleaning the injury and administering antibiotics I gave him an antidote and he walked off. If the elephant had been left untreated he would have been dead within a week.”All hunting is illegal in Kenya, a nation that has led the war against the plundering of wildlife, and ivory trafficking in particular. The Independent\u0027s Stop The Illegal Wildlife Trade campaign was launched to call for an international effort to clamp down on poaching and the illegal trade of wild animals.Funds raised will to pay for vital wildlife protection projects implemented by the campaign’s partner charity Space for Giants.

The communities around Loisaba understand the value of wildlife, and the happy result is the conservancy is a zero poaching zone - a fact that even pachyderms themselves might understand. Silvester told The Independent “it’s likely that Alan the elephant was shot elsewhere, but the intelligence of this bull, in moving quickly to a place of safety Loisaba Conservancy, allowed the rangers and the vet team to assure his wound was treated quickly and successfully.“He continues to roam Laikipia as a testament to his forefathers, the huge tuskers before him.“Orahle adds “the rangers continued to monitor the bull, and he was last spotted in early August looking happy and not limping at all.”Alan was not the only animal to be rescued in Loisaba that day. The ranger team rushed off to treat a giraffe with a split hoof. In the midst of a raging global pandemic Loisaba’s wildlife operations continue to protect endangered species, preserving bioersity and supporting local communities in the process.The wildlife veterinary unit that saved the elephant is sponsored by Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, working in collaboration with KWS, to attend wildlife cases in Laikipia.

UCAS said once universities have the new marks they will be able to make decisions as to which students get a spot. But there is no clarity on what happens to students who have already confirmed places at universities that were not their second choice.

General secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said Geoff Barton told The Times: “We are concerned about the potential impact on schools and colleges of processing large numbers of appeals over A-level results just at the time that they are also managing theof all students and the complex set of safety measures involved.“Some colleges report that they need to deal with hundreds of inidual appeals, all of which will be a major distraction for leaders and teachers.“This pressure will mount further following GCSE results on Thursday, which are also likely to generate many appealsteacher-assessed grades are once again moderated down. Any appeals process must be simple, swt and free from bureaucracy so that the opening of schools and colleges remains the priority.”Will Baldwin, Head of Brighton, Hove and Sussex Sixth Form College - one of the largest in the country with , students - said he simply did not have the resources to deal with appeals and getting schools ready. He said: “We do not have the capacity to deal with the volume of A-level appeals we know are forthcoming, when we know we are about to be dealing with hundreds of GCSE applicants who may have not reached the threshold required for enrolment, while preparing to reopen for all students in a Covid-safe way in September. We simply do not have the capacity.“I would like to say managing our appeals and GCSE applicants will not jeopardise the safe reopening of college but unfortunately doing everything is an impossible task.”Boris Johnson has said repeatedly schools will reopen in September for all pupils - no matter what. Schools have told been by the PM it is their moral duty to make sure kids are back in classrooms but a range of measures, including staggered arrival and departure times, dferent lunch breaks, one-way systems and other social distancing measures require teachers to spend a lot of time readying them for the first day back.But rules on how to apply for an appeal for the thousands of devastated A-level kids who had the results downgraded because of the computer generated standardisation.Ofqual issued guidance on Saturday afternoon and then hastily withdrew it. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is facing pressure to resign after his promised triple lock safety net, which would let kids rely on their mock exams in an appeal, fell apart.Many teachers are demanding students should be able to rely on their predicted grades. GCSE students are facing a similar fiasco and could lose out on spots at schools. Mr Williamson said the Government expects all schools back open and has even threatened to use emergency Covid- powers to force them to reopen. Parents will be finedthey do not send their children back without a good medical reason. Head teacher of South Hampstead High School said: At some pointwe need to get ready for GCSEs and the long-awaitedof all pupils in September. The appeals process is really important, but the fallout from results is a major distraction from preparing for September.

Expecting schools to submit appeals where grades were incorrect placed a burden on teachers when they need to be preparing for the new term and has created uncertainty and anxiety for students. For all of that, we are extremely sorry.We have therefore decided that students be awarded their centre assessment for this summer - that is, the grade their school or college estimated was the grade they would most likely have achieved in their exam - or the moderated grade, whichever is higher.The path forward we now plan to implement will provide urgent clarity. We are already working with the Department for Education, universities and everyone  affected by this issue.GCSE students are set to receive their results on August  - despite them missing exam season.Results day will not be delayed despite fears it would be. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His regime has since been brutally silencing critics with heavy handed police tactics on the streets and reports of hideous torture in detention centres.With anger and international pressure growing, Lukashenko finally offered some ground to the opposition as he was admitted he was willing to change the constitution. The ex-Soviet strongman leader however refused to bow to widespread protests and said there will be no new elections following the disputed vote on August . We held elections already. Until you kill me, there will be no other elections, he said.Lukashenko - who has ruled Belarus for  years - faced heckles of step down during the speech at a state-run industrial plant as he pledged to put changes in the constitution to a referendum.The flimsy olive branch is unlikely to satisfy protesters and the opposition who have already seen one vote allegedly rigged against them.He said: Yes, I’m not a saint. You know my harsh side. I’m not eternal. Butyou drag down the first president you’ll drag down neighbouring countries and all the rest.Hundreds of thousands have hit the streets, state workers have gone on strike, , people have been detained, and the internet has been cut off by the regime.Lukashenko has mocked the violence carried out by his security forces, saying it was justied as protesters attacked police. The international community is nervously eying the crisis and have condemned the dictator - with Russia offering to step in to help prop up Lukashenko.EU leaders are set to hold emergency talks by video conference on Wednesday as European Council chief Charles Michel said violence against protesters was unacceptable.British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has also taken a stand against the brutality being inflicted in Belarus - saying the UK does not accept the result of the election.He said: The world has watched with horror at the violence used by the Belarusian authorities to suppress the peaceful protests that followed this fraudulent Presidential election. The UK does not accept the results. We urgently need an independent investigation through the OSCE into the flaws that rendered the election unfair, as well as the grisly repression that followed. The UK will work with our international partners to sanction those responsible, and hold the Belarusian authorities to account.EU leaders have called on Russia to refrain from any interference after it was warned Vladimir Putin could send troops to help out Lukashenko.Moscow has a vested interest in neighbouring Belarus and Putin was quick to congratulate Lukashenko on his victory.Putin has showed before he will stop at nothing to make sure Russia’s neighbours are run by his friends.The Kremlin said in a statement Putin and Lukashenko agreed to “comprehensive assistance to maintain security in Belarus”in talks oN sunday.Lithuanias foreign minister Linas Linkevicius warned any Russian intervention would constitute an invasion.He said: Russia would risk a lotit did it, in the face of what is going on in Belarus, in the face of the popular support. It should figure out that an invasion would not be justied, neither legally, nor morally, nor politically.Belarus electoral commission said Lukashenko won last weeks vote in a landslide - securing  per cent of the vote over highly popular opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya.Tikhanovskaya, , a former English teacher, who emerged from obscurity to become Lukashenkos main rival - with her rallies drawing some of the biggest crowds since the fall of the Soviet Union in .After the election, she said she considered herself the winner and alleged the vote had been rigged before she fled to Lithuania.She has said in a video message that she is ready to step in to become a national leader and promised to hold new election and free political prisoners.Lukashenko, , has been widely condemned for his handling of the Covid- pandemic which he said could be treated with saunas and vodka.He has  has cast himself as a guarantor of stability but has battled a wave of anger over the the economy, his human rights record and allegations of corruption.He dismissed his opposition candidate Ms Tikhanovskaya as a poor little girl, manipulated by foreign puppet masters.And he also blasted reports of his government imposing repressive measures as fake news or far-fetched accusations.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is latest in a growing dossier of cover-up allegations to be fired at China as the nation comes under scrutiny for its actions in the early days of the pandemic.China has been accused of attempting to downplay the virus as it spread out from the city of Wuhan.It has now infected almost million people and killed nearly ,.Beijing has always denied any improper behaviour over its handling of the pandemic, saying it was open and transparent over the virus.Mr Potter said the mismatched data was revealed after a string of passwords linked to the Wuhan Institute of Virologywere leaed online.Hackers were able to get inside the institutions systems and some of the data from WIV was sent to Mr Potter and Professor Balding for analysis. He said: When we anaylsed that, it was a bit of a mismatch of data against what they’d been publicly putting out there to the World health Organisation.Mr Potter explained much of the database of , entries appeared to have been deleted before a certain date and day to day case numbers were skewed. He said: Once the story became quite a bit contentious, and when the Chinese Communist Party realised that the coronavirus was going to become a global pandemic, they went about purging the data.Meanwhile, Professor Balding, from Fulbright University Vietnam said the database is likely an example of Chinese government officials censoring upwards to please their bosses. He explained: It appears to have been censored upwards, so ithad been censored internally many times before they released the data.This seems to indicate they have some kind of internal targets they want to hit to try and show progress.This seems to imply they were fudging their own numbers for their own purposes as well as external purposes.Mr Potter admitted it is going to take some time to fully understand what data missing and by how much it was altered.He said a team are now working to drag out the real numbers from the depths of the purged database.China has so far recorded , cases and , deaths - with the figures being just a fraction of those being seen in countries like the US and UK.WIV has come under scrutiny during the pandemic as a potential source of the outbreak as it was known to be studying bat coronaviruses similar to Covid-.The scientic consensus is that the virus originated naturally - potentially from a wet market in Wuhan where it jumped from animals to humans.Questions remain however with figures such as US President Donald Trump demanding answers from China and suggesting there could be more to the origin of the pandemic. Trump continues to call coronavirus the China Virus and has accused Beijing of a cover-up - casting doubt on its light figures.The Trump administration has even gone as far as suggesting the pathogen could be man-made - and that they have evidence.The row has seen Chinese-US relations plunge towards a new Cold War, with Trump saying the pandemic changed his great relationship with President Xi Jinping.Meanwhile, a bombshell spy dossier has outright claimed China lied to the world about coronavirus by covering up the outbreak.The dossier, from the Five Eyes intelligence agencies of the US, Canada, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, stated that Chinas secrecy surrounding the virus led to an assault on international transparency.It said: Despite evidence of human-human transmission from early December, PRC authorities deny it until January .”The spy dossier also discussed Chinas silencing or disappearing of doctors who tried to speak out about the virus.And it also looks at the destruction of evidence in laboratories and refusing to provide samples to scientists who were working on a vaccine.The -page document, obtained by Australias The Saturday , has laid the foundation for a case being created against China.And then, Chinese scientist Dr Li Meng-Yan who fled the country in April, has also claimed the Communist Party sought to cover up the virus.Dr Li claims that when she took her findings about Covid- to her superiors she was told to keep silent and be careful.She explained: “I have to hide because I know how they treat whistleblowers, and as a whistleblower here I want to tell the truth of Covid- and the origin of the SARS- Covid virus.”Doctors have reported being detained after speaking out on social media about what they were witnessing, while journalists have recounted being harassed and having their equipment confiscated after trying to report on the outbreak in China.Ill-fated whistle blower Dr Li Wenliang tried to warn the world about the killer virus but was sent a chilling letter by the police before he died.He was told by copshe refused to repent he would be punished not long before he was killed by the deadly virus.Scientists have also claimed this week the new coronavirus may have actually originated , miles from Wuhan in .

Its about jobs, about kids being able to get back to school - the decisions we make now have an impact on  all of those things.Although not at the infection rate of Leicester before heading into lockdown , Birmingham is now alarmingly close to the situation in Blackburn and Lancashire where the rate reached around .On August  Health chiefs have revealed their latest watch list of coronavirus hotspots - including those now at risk of new localised lockdowns.Public Health England named  areas of intervention where special measures are already in place and eight areas of concern where restrictions could come next.Newark and Sherwood in Nottinghamshire is the latest region added to the list following a worrying rise in reported infections.It has now been deemed an area of concern in the new report released by experts from PHE.The area has recorded . cases of coronavirus per , people in the last seven days.Health bosses warned that all local the current lockdowns were under constant consideration.And said other towns could be slapped with tough new restrictionsinfection rates crept up.Dr Justin Varney, Director of Public Health at Birmingham City Council, told the Sun Online: “The rate of cases has been rising in Birmingham, this reflects both an increase in spread of Covid-, especially linked to social gatherings and workplaces, and also an increase in the uptake of testing, the latter of which is positive.“It is important to highlight that the levels remain signicantly lower than other parts of the country in local lockdown but have increased over August and we are working with communities, businesses and the NHS to increase access to testing, engagement with the confidential NHS tracing service and to support Covid-safe workplaces.“This latest data is an important reminder that we all have a continued part to play in controlling the spread of this virus through keeping social distance, washing hands regularly and wearing face coverings inside a range of settings including shops and taxis, on public transport and in faith settings.” To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A stf of a game show dreamt up by Simon Cowell’s Over The Top Productions company and hosted by Stephen Mulhern, who charged on to the set, Saturday night, shouting: “Oh yes, I hope you’re ready. This is going to be good.”It wasn’t, obviously. It was going to be anything but good.Rolling In It is a show where every single thing is working against it being good, in fact, from the fixtures and fittings to the ropey old format where they’ve attempted to fuse the random “thrill” of Tipping Point with Who Wants To Be A Millionaire , minus the decent cash prize.The technology here isn’t exactly state of the art either. It’s an old arcade game. So, before answering  lobotomised questions , the contestants must roll a gigantic coin down a chute which can end up in a cash prize basket, but more often than not ends up bankrupting them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, as you’ve probably noticed, is currently playing exactly the same game with the British economy and probably thinks Rolling In It is a fantastic idea for a game show.ITV in its heart of hearts, though, clearly does not. How can you tell Because they’ve had to ditch the normal, run-of-the-mill contestants and partner-up some visibly reluctant ITV celebs with X Factor-style “characters” who are meant to ert your attention from the game.Saturday night, we had a live wire called Jana, who announced her arrival by telling Mulhern he’d “lost weight”. “What ”The week before there was another handful by the name of Lesley, who brought proceedings to a temporary halt, at the introductions’ stage, with this announcement. “I arrange funerals.”I’d stick around then, Lesley. I’ve checked this show’s vital signs and I think we’re talking weeks rather than months.I worry, too, about the long-term prospects of ITV in the current climate.The share price is down, advertising’s hit an all-time low, Ant  Dec are wintering in Rhyl and the new home for I’m A Celeb is literally a folly.The very remote possibility exists, I will admit, that Rolling In It is part of a deep-state plan to frighten everyone back to work — “Return to the office NOW, or you’re getting a second series of this rubbish.”But I don’t think we really need to look beyond the obvious lockdown explanation here.The cupboard is bare.ITV has simply run out of anything  worth showing, we’re now on to the stuff that was never meant to see the light of day, and as good as it’s ever going to get for Rolling In It is Gemma Collins revealing that: “My intuition is telling me shot put.”Then please go with your intuition, Gemma. Team GB demands it.Nasser Hussein: “The three non-negotiable players were Atherton, Stewart, Thorpe and Gough.”Paul Merson: “Every City signing is just another cog in the jigsaw.”Steven Gerrard: “The quality on the bench is the quality that’s not even on the bench.” BBC’S re-run of the original and arguably best Line Of Duty series concluded, last night, with the Organised Crime Gang still on the loose and DCI Tony Gates putting his tortured Irish wolfhound out of its misery before killing himself.The character I always feel sorry for, watching this  version of the show, though, is Jackie Laverty, Gates’ miserable girlfriend, who had her throat slit in the second episode.She was then stashed in Terry’s freezer, just behind the crispy pancakes and Cornettos, until her corpse was dramatically rediscovered in the fourth episode of the fth series, in April , looking almost as gormless as DI Buckells.In the process, she missed: The show’s big move to Belfast, in series two, the DI Denton years, with Keeley Hawes, balaclava man, Thandie Newton’s appearance, Ted Hastings’ long, dark nights of the soul at the Edge Park hotel, and DS Steve Arnott’s subtle transition from grey tank tops to lurid waistcoats, straight after he slept with DC Georgia Trotman at the beginning of the second run.I’d imagine Jackie actress Gina McKee casts a frosty stare or two in the direction of her agent as well.Line Of Duty may never have been so gloriously easy to understand, or free from abbreviations, as it was in series one, but while her character’s been solidying at Terry’s gaff it has become the most consistently brilliant drama of the decade.Sadly for her, Jackie Laverty is not actually due to defrost fully until series seven and the next runis going to be the last.No official word yet as to when that production will reach our screens but, you can guarantee already, Line Of Duty’s final episodes will be the television event of the year.BBC’s new sitcom Mandy  Well I came and I watched without laughing.

Did you give quite a bit of thought to that Wright replied: No. I was worried what this person following was going to do. The reason I put it on the shelf was because I thought these people might check.Mr Christopher alleged that Wright had also planted more contaminated baby food at another Tesco in Rochdale.He said: The truth is you did place those two jars in Rochdale and you knew there was more than the jar in Lockerbie that had been placed out there and might be bought by customers.Even by then you had seen the news of the recall of the jars because of the Lockerbie jar. You were still looking to seethere was any other news.Wright admitted carrying out a Google search, but continued to deny being responsible for the Rochdale jars.The defendant also denied that dozens of letters sent to the supermarket chain were about attacking Tesco.In one communication with the superstore, he threatened to go to the national media, but never did, the court heard.Mr Christopher said: There came a stage you were prepared in the circumstances to put a jar of baby food you knew had been contaminated on a shelf where it would be bought by the parent of a young child.Wright told jurors: I was not  per cent sure it was contaminated.Mr Christopher went on: You expected it to be contaminated and you put it on a shelf where it might be bought.Thats a more extreme step than telling the national media what you threatened in this letter. Why didnt you tell the national media Wright replied: I did not want to hurt the store in that way.The prosecutor said: So you are prepared to have a jar contaminated by sharp metal be bought by the parent of a young child but you did not want to damage the reputation of Tesco by talking to the national press Wright insisted: I was given the jar on that occasion.Mr Christopher added: This was a game for you wasnt it  You were taking delight in being able to outsmart them.The defendant denied it, saying he was in fear of his le and that of his loved ones.Wright said he initially lied to police following his arrest about what had sparked the dispute with the travellers.He told jurors: Its embarrassing. Im supposed to be the person to protect my family and I could not even protect myself. It was embarrassing and humiliating.Wright, from Market Rasen, Lincolnshire, denies two counts of contaminating goods and three counts of blackmail for demanding cryptocurrency from Tesco in exchange for revealing where the contaminated food had been placed.He also denies a further charge of blackmail for allegedly demanding £, worth of bitcoin from a driver with whom he had had a road rage altercation.Concluding his cross-examination, Mr Christopher asked why Wright did not take other measures to protect his family, such as sending his children out of harms way.Wright became emotional as he said he could have ended his marriage and told his we to pack her bags and take the children.Mr Christopher asserted: The truth is you were not in fear at all. You were carrying on your le normally while hoping to make yourself rich by threatening Tesco in this way while endangering the le of others in the process.The trial was adjourned until Tuesday.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will be posting updates later today.And defence minister Johnny Mercer said today he was concerned for GCSE results on Thursday, adding there were injustices taking place with regards to exams.He wrote on Facebook: As someone who spends so much time in the schools and colleges in my constituency, and someone who strives endlessly to improve opportunities for young people from Plymouth, you can imagine my views, which I have made very clear within Government.He hinted that the Government were about to back down in the face of uproar, adding: I do not believe this is the end of the story - there are too many clear injustices. At this time we must not panic, and await developments. I am limited in what I can say publicly - I have had many private conversations. Tory former minister Steve Brine said the Government needs to make a radical announcement on exam results today.Speaking to the BBCs World at One, he said: I think that the announcement this afternoon needs to be, and will be, radical.Tory former minister Stephen Hammond called the whole thing a shambles.He called for Ofqual to get the appeals process sorted by the end of the day so pupils can find out what they need to do as soon as possible.Mr Hammond, the MP for Wimbledon, told Sky News: These young people are not an exam board number, they are real people who deserve fairness and a chance to have their futures put in a solid position very quickly.And he suggested that delaying GCSE results day probably is the right thing to do.Tory peer and ex education secretary Lord Baker lashed the “flawed” algorithm used to dish out results.He said: “If you are in a hole, stop digging.I urge the Education Secretary to instruct Ofqual not to release the GCSE results this Thursday as their algorithm is flawed. The A-level results have produced hundreds of thousands of unfair and barely explicable downgrades.”Robert Syms told Times Radio this morning: We watched Scotland and the SNP get into trouble, and they sort of got into a bit of a hole. And they got out of it and took some criticism. And weve just climbed into the same hole, but were not getting out of it were still digging at the moment.He added that he would be happy for GCSE students to be awarded their teacher-assessed grades and that most Conservative MPs would be.His own son had his grades marked down, he revealed.There is real risk of Tory MPs going on the warpath, he warned.Former Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the algorithm-awarded A-level grades should be abandoned, with teacher assessments or mocks used instead.No algorithm is going to sort our problem out, its a human issue, he told LBC Radio.The idea that you have an algorithm to figure out what they might have done in an exam is really impossible and I think thats where the big mistakes will be made.Tory MP Sir Oliver Heald, a former minister, has called for the Government to take action to recty results where pupils feel an injustice has been done.In a statement, the North East Hertfordshire MP said: It seems that the Ofqual algorithm is a blunt instrument and has adversely affected schools and colleges with large sixth forms.I am pressing the Government to urgently make changes to the system and am also advising all students to work with their schools and colleges on appeals where they feel an injustice has been done.Veteran Tory Sir Edward Leigh has written to Education Minister Nick Gibb about the clear injustice faced by some A-level students.The Gainsborough MP said: I am concerned that some hardworking pupils have been downgraded because this years results are based on last years.He said he had asked Mr Gibb to reconsider the Governments approach and allow teachers assessments to be used when there is clear injustice.One Tory MP told The Sun the crisis is “not quite a poll tax moment” but is making the government “look incompetent”.Anne Longfield, the childrens commissioner also came out today to urge change.She said: “Having looked at the evidence, it seems clear to me that GCSE results this year should be based on centre assessment grades - not the algorithm developed by Ofqual.”Yesterday, Ofqual published its guidelines for how to appeal - but swtly took them down after it emerged they contradicted the Governments own policy on which grade could be used.As of this morning they still havent republished the guidance, and kids are left in the dark about how to get their marks changed.No Government ministers have been on the radio or TV today to explain the position as critics rounded on Education Secretary Gavin Williamson.Former Ofsted boss Sir Micheal Wilshaw says the shambles is a terrible situation and a farce.He told the BBC Radio  programme: Ofqual have got to work much more closely with Government. Its completely wrong that the Gov, DFE and Ofqual are not singing from the same hymn sheet, especially on appeals.Ofqual have got to get their act together and be much more visible.Just days before pupils are meant to get their results, politicians in Northern Ireland announced they would ditch the computer model for GCSEs, after the huge fallout from A-level results last week.Peter Weir, the education minister, said the decision would not delay the results and that there wasnt enough data about GCSEs in order to use the computer model.He said today: These are exceptional circumstances and in exceptional times truly dficult decisions are made.I am conscious that for GCSEs, unlike at A-level, we do not have system level prior performance data for this group of young people.I want to encourage as many young people as possible to remain in education or training post- and to know they have another opportunity to engage with education.I am also mindful that unlike A-level, many GCSE pupils will not have access to previous public examination outcomes to inform any appeals process.I have, therefore, acted now in advance of the publication of GCSE results to ease anxieties, reassure young people and their families and ensure that every inidual candidate receives a grade that recognises the work they have done.Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham is to write to Englands exams regulator to initiate legal action over the A-level results process.He tweeted on Monday: So it looks like the Government ARE digging in and standing by their deeply flawed system.In that case, I will be taking legal advice this morning and have instructed leading Counsel. I expect to be writing to Ofqual later today to initiate action.Scorned students have mounted a flood of legal challenges against their botched A Level grades too.Curtis Parfitt-Ford told the BBC today: We are confident that what this algorithm is doing is grading schools and not students.Which we think goes outside of Ofquals statutory remit.We are confident we have a strong case. We hope we wont have to take it to court, butwe do, we are ready to do so.They have also raised £, through crowdfunding to help with the case.And Labour big beast and ex-Education Secretary Alan Johnson told The Sun that Mr Williamson should be sacked.He said: “This job was totally beyond his capabilities. He should go. They may try to blame it all on Ofqual, but this was Gavin Williamson’s mess and he has to take the bullet.”The Department for Education has insisted that results had to be moderated to stop grade inflation going off the scale.A Downing Street source insisted the PM does still have confidence in Mr Williamson.It comes as some Ofqual board members reportedly want controversial algorithm results overturned and replaced with predicted grades, the  reported.Sources said some members of the Ofqual board believe the algorithm has caused a haemorrhaging of public opinion on qualications.The board members reportedly want to U-turn and use teachers predicted grades for students, as happened in Scotland.Using the predicted grades instead of the algorithm is reportedly seen as the least bad option.We are in a position where it is politically unacceptable to continue with the algorithm - this is the view of some people on the Ofqual board, a source told the .Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, told BBC Breakfast that, according to a study by the organisation, the algorithm has failed.He said: Weve just done a study and we looked at , entries, which is almost half of all the A-level entries in sixth-form colleges, across  A-level subjects - every single A-level subject.In every single one of those , entries in  A-level subjects, they came out lower than the previous three-year average. So the algorithm has failed.Steve Chalke, founder of the Oasis Academy Trust, has called for GCSE results to be postponed.Mr Chalke told the BBC:: I think there should be a delay. I think there should be an apology for the A-levels, a humble apology, and I think that there should be a delay around the GCSEs because it is better to reflect on what has happened, for Ofqual and for the Government to reflect and then respond having consulted with people outside of their own systems, with senior educationalists, rather than react and then regret, and then withdraw and then put a plan forward etc.After reflection, it may be decided it is the best possible answer that were left with, but lets not make all the same mistakes over the GCSEs.Grammar school headteacher Kay Mountfield said schools like hers have seen % of their student cohort downgraded.The head of Sir William Borlases Grammar School in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, told BBC Radio s Today programme that most of their kids had their grades marked down.She said:Only  students out of  have kept their grades. Eighteen were downgraded by three grades,  by two grades and theyre scrabbling about for university places that just arent there.Seventy of my students have not had their first choice of university - normally that would be about five, or  maybe, students. But I have  grammar school students, from a range of backgrounds, who have worked very hard for their grades, struggling to get into universities.A Department for Education spokesperson said last night: “Hundreds of thousands of students have received a calculated grade that will enable them progress to the next stage of their education or into work.“We have been clear that we want to build as much fairness into the appeals process as possible to help young people in the most dficult cases and have been working with Ofqual to achieve that.Ofqual continues to consider how to best deliver the appeals process to give schools and pupils the clarity they need.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

No U-turn, no change.”He said this evening that it became clear to him that more needed to be done over the weekend.Mr Williamson also said he would rip up the cap on university places - and urged them to take as many as possible.He added: They wont be fined and were removing those caps on every single university in the United Kingdom, so that they have the ability to expand the number of places, welcoming more students into those universities, as many as possible.It came after:Roger Taylor, Chair of the exams regulator Ofqual said in a grovelling apology: The pandemic has created circumstances no one could have ever imagined or wished for. We want to now take steps to remove as much stress and uncertainty for young people as possible - and to free up heads and teachers to work towards the important task of getting all schools open in two weeks.After reflection, we have decided that the best way to do this is to award grades on the basis of what teachers submitted. The switch to centre assessment grades will apply to both AS and A levels and to the GCSE results which students will receive later this week.He admitted the change in the system had caused real anguish and damaged public confidence.And the burden had been placed on teachers - who needed to get ready for the start of the new term rather than worry about sending off thousands of appeals.He stressed: For all of that, we are extremely sorry.We have therefore decided that students be awarded their centre assessment for this summer - that is, the grade their school or college estimated was the grade they would most likely have achieved in their exam - or the moderated grade, whichever is higher.A-level student Nina Bunting Mitcham, from Peterborough said at the news: I am so happy for my future, my peers in my college, everybody  affected.Everyone has been heard, finally. The fact I was given a prediction of ABB means I will have those grades and be able to become a vet.I couldnt be happier, I really couldnt.She had got CDD before todays news.Of the chaos around the u-turn she said of the Government: They have really embarrassed themselves, but they have been able to turn it around, to show they do have a heart.They do have some realisation of what they have done, and they have listened for once.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer tweeted as soon as the move was confirmed:The Government has had months to sort out exams and has now been forced into a screeching U-turn after days of confusion.This is a victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week.However, the Tories handling of this situation has been a complete fiasco.Incompetence has become this Governments watchword, whether that is on schools, testing or care homes.Boris Johnsons failure to lead is holding Britain back.Its not clear yet exactly what will happen now with university and apprenticeship applications.Mr Williamsons decision to rip up the cap means many more thousands can go to university -the place wants to offer them one.But many may not be able to get a place, and may be askedthey can defer for a year.Admissions service UCAS said they were working with universities, colleges and schools to support students to understand their options.They said universities would get the teacher grades and could make their own decisions - giving hope to thousands who may have given up hope on their preferred place.They added: “For those students who were not placed with their firmchoice university, our advice is that you don’t need to make your decision immediately. Speak with your parents, s and teachers and then your first conversation will need to be to your firmchoice university.Once your university has your ‘Centre Assessed Grades ’ via exam bodies they can make a decision as to whether there is a place at your preferred choice.“We will be issuing new advice for students and schools and this will be sent directly to students as soon as they are able to take a decision.“UCAS is working with Universities UK and the education sector and whilst the decision is with the inidual university, we will do everything we can to support students to use their CAGs to secure the best possible outcome.”University College London has said they will accept all pupils given an offer, but are still working out how this will apply to courses such as medicine - which had a cap on numbers based on practical constraints.The London university said: UCL’s priority is to be as fair as possible to all applicants, recognising that they have worked hard during unprecedented circumstances and deserve their first choice university.We are delighted to accept all students who meet the terms of their original offer on all programmes that do not have an externally-determined cap .For those students who have met our offer to study medicine based on teacher-assessed grades but do not yet have a place confirmed, we are working with the relevant agencies about places this year and we will guarantee a deferred place for next year.Opposition MPs said the change came too little too late.Wera Hobhouse tweeted: While this u-turn is welcome, it comes too late for many students who have missed out on course places. The Government has shattered young peoples hopes and plans. @GavinWilliamson and @BorisJohnson - how will you make this right Some universities have said they will take kids predicted grades regardless of the changes anyway.But others are sticking with the computer marks and have said they are already full up.Its not clear whether students who have a spot at their second place can refuse it, and get their first choice place again.Mary Curnock Cook, formerly UCAS chief executive, told the BBC kids could have to take gap years because there simply isnt enough places at universities now.She said today: There are literally tens of thousands of students who decisions have already been made about who they accept and dont accept.This change will mean that universities have to rethink completely.I think we must expect from the Government very soon that the cap on university students should be lted. Many have filled their places rightly and now they are being asked to take in potentially tens of thousands of people moved back to their centre assessed grades.There will be some courses that are just physically full and may have to offer deferrals.Tory MPs are set to have meetings with ministers to explain the sweeping changes.Churchills grandson and former Tory MP Sir Nicolas Soames branded Mr Williamson a complete inadequate.And Tory George Freeman MP tweeted at todays news: This #ExamResults shambles has been hugely damaging to trust in the @educationgovuk @DowningStreet:When it was obvious.Defence minister Johnny Mercer and Paymaster General Penny Mordaunt were two serving members of the Government to speak out ahead of the massive u-turn.Dozens of backbenchers and former ministers soon joined in too, forcing the Government to act.Students have been left furious and devastated after algorithms marked their grades down - as they were unable to take exams due to the coronavirus crisis.The PM has confidence in the Education Secretary, Gavin Williamson, and the head of exams regulator Ofqual despite the chaos.Boris Johnson broke off his Scottish holiday this morning to hold a call with the Education Secretary and other senior officials to discuss the huge change in policy.Tory MPs - including current serving ministers - rounded on the Government for the shambles and demanded they change course.Several Tories were rounding on the Education Secretary last week - amid speculation he could lose his job over the fiasco.After the u-turn he was   with Ladbrokes to be the next Cabinet minister to leave their post.Jessica OReilly of Ladbrokes said: Given the backlash to exam grades its perhaps not too much of a surprise that Williamson is the clear favourite now in a hotly contested market.And a YouGov poll this evening said  per cent of the public said he should quit.He said this afternoon when askedhe would consider quitting that he went to a comprehensive and is determined to fix this.Tory MP George Freeman hinted his job might be on the line.He told Times Radio: Ultimately, the Prime Minister is in charge. And I think he will want to take firm control of this and get a grip and show that his government is taking the le chances of a generation of children seriously... Im told the Prime Ministers you know, planning to reshuffle in the autumn, and I dare say he wants to take everything into account.Labour big beast and ex Education Secretary Alan Johnson told The Sun that Mr Williamson should be sacked.He said: “This job was totally beyond his capabilities. He should go. They may try to blame it all on Ofqual, but this was Gavin Williamson’s mess and he has to take the bullet.”Under-fire exams boss Sally Collier was today blasted for being “invisible” and more secretive than the KGB during the A Levels fiasco.The Ofqual boss - a lelong bureaucrat who earns a whopping £, a year – has not been seen or heard from throughout the fiasco.Fuming politicians and teachers said she must “show her face” and apologise to pupils let down by the disaster.They called for her to be put on her final warning and sackeda way out of the mess is not found.Tory MP Robert Halfon, chairman of the education select committee, told The Sun: “Ofqual have been more secretive than the KGB.“They have behaved like secretive cardinals at the Vatican choosing a Pope rather than like officials developing a transparent grading system.“There is going to need to be fundamental changes at Ofqual when this is all over.”Former Ofsted boss Sir Michael Wilshaw branded the chaos a terrible farce and slammed invisible bosses at Ofqual.Steve Chalke, boss of the academy school chain Oasis, told The Sun that Ms Collier in in the last chance saloon.He said: “She should own up and apologise to every child for the emotional trauma and apologise to students and teachers.“This mess is an insult to teachers and pupils.“They had six months to get ready for this.”Askedshe should quit over the fiasco, he said: “I believe in forgiveness, but she needs to step up and explain herself. This should be her last chance.The PM’s official spokesman insisted Boris Johnson still has full confidence in Ms Collier and Ofqual.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Families on breaks in traditionally popular hotspots such as France, Spain and Portugal must quarantine for two weeks when they get back after the destinations were removed from the UKaposs travel corridor list to curb the spread of Covid-. Facing a fortnight of Government-ordered self-isolation, millions of cautious Brits desperate for a getaway have opted for a UK break instead – sparking a spike in staycations.Downing Street refused to deny tourists ing from Croatia and Greece could soon face quarantine measures after an increase in coronavirus cases in the countries.A No  spokesman said the Government continue to keep these rules under review and protecting public health remains its priority. Travel expert Paul Charles, of the PC Agency, suggested the Government should adopt an Icelandic airport testing scheme, subsidising the cost so passengers pay £. Passengers heading to Iceland have the option of booking a swab test on arrival instead of going into quarantine for  days. They must self-isolate for five days before taking a second test, which is free, at a medical centre. If both come back negative, they can carry on as normal. Total quarantine could be less than seven days. “We have to bring this system to the UK as soon as possible,” Mr Charles told the Daily Mail. “We cannot go on with this -day quarantine system, which is unworkable and causing anxiety among consumers who are losing money. “Adopting this Iceland system here would be a game-changer. “It is far better than the damage and scarring being done to the economy by quarantine measures.”  Airlines UK policy and public affairs director Rob Griggs told the Mirror: “The UK urgently needs a testing regime as an alternative to quarantine, as part of the new normal for aviation as we live with the virus. “Countries like Germany have already introduced a free, one test system for arrivals where, once you’ve had a negative result, you can leave isolation. “This is critical not just for opening up hugely important markets like the United States, but also for travel closer to home. “We’re at real risk of falling behind on testing and Government needs to get a move on.”  Heathrow Airport could offer a £, -second Covid- test to passengers arriving from virus hotspots. Passengers would be checked inside Terminal  and the results would take up to seven hours to process. They would then take a follow-up test at home five to eight days later. The scheme would be ready to launch within two weeks of the Government saying those tested and whose results are negative could be released from quarantine early.  Heathrow Airport chief executive John Holland-Kaye said: “Testing will not only avoid the “quarantine roulette” that so many passengers faced in Spain and France, it will also open up flights to key trading partners such as the US, Canada and Singapore. “The Government’s own research shows that a double test has a high level of accuracy in screening for Covid. “This facility is an oven-ready opportunity to see how Britain can safely reopen for business, as other countries are doing.” How it works in Iceland Icelandaposs airport testing strategy is seen as a model for how travellers can avoid two weeksapos quarantine when they arrive on foreign soil. Explaining how the Polymerase chain reactionswab test will allow disease-free arrivals to leave self-isolation before the usual fortnight, the North Atlantic countryaposs governmentaposs website says that “all passengers arriving in Icelandfrom high-risk areas who intend to stay in Iceland for  days or more have to undergo two PCR-tests”. It adds: “The first is at the border on arrival and the second by the primary health care service four to six days later. “In between the two tests special precautions need to be taken. “The second test is free of charge and testing is available at health care services all over the country.” Passengers who book the test in advance pay , Icelandic krona – about £ – rising to , krona – about £. –paid on arrival. From Wednesday “all arriving passengers can choose between a -day quarantine or a double testing procedure along with a quarantine for five to six days”. It goes on: “The double border-screening procedure requires all passengers arriving in Iceland to undergo two PCR-tests: one upon arrival and another five to six days later to minimise the risk of a  negative causing infection to spread in the community.

Teachersapos predictions for A-level, AS-level and GCSE results will now be used instead of a bungled computer algorithm which left % of teenagers with downgraded marks. It came after calls for a U-turn from top Tories, Labour MPs and even advisors to the exam regulator Ofqual. But as the dust settles on the announcement, itaposs too late for some -year-olds to go to the university of their choice. Beleaguered Education Secretary Gavin Williamson failed to guarantee there will be enough capacity for all of them. He refused to resign but apologised to children, saying: It is clear that the process of allocating grades has resulted in more signicant inconsistencies than can be resolved through an appeals process. We now believe it is better to offer young people and parents certainty by moving to teacher assessed grades for both A and AS level and GCSE results. I am sorry for the distress this has caused young people and their parents but hope this announcement will now provide the certainty and reassurance they deserve. But Boris Johnson refused to cut short his holiday in Scotland to deal with the crisis.  Labour leader Keir Starmer said: The Tories’ handling of this situation has been a complete fiasco. Incompetence has become this Government’s watchword, whether that is on schools, testing or care homes. Boris Johnson ’s failure to lead is holding Britain back. He added: The Government has had months to sort out exams and has now been forced into a screeching U-turn after days of confusion. This is a victory for the thousands of young people who have powerfully made their voices heard this past week. So how did the row unfold and what happens nowyouaposre a GCSE or A-level student  Hereaposs what you need to know. What do you think of how grades have been decided  Join the conversation in our comments below oryouaposre affected, email your story to webnews@mirror. What caused all this  Coronavirus forced schools to shut and meant GCSE and A-level exams were cancelled this summer. But students still need results to leave school with - which have been worked out without those exams. How were A-level and GCSE grades decided   Studentsapos grades in England are based on predicted grades, submitted by their teachers. These are called aposCentre Assessment Gradesapos . But those CAGs were moderated by exam boards first, before they got turned into a final grade. This standardisation was supposed to make sure the same standard is applied for all students, whichever school, college or part of the country they come from. What went wrong   % of all A-level grades in England were downgraded from the CAGs - including , by two or more grades - to standardise results and stop them inflating. Official figures show students in the poorest areas were marked down by .% while those in the richest were marked down by .%. That meant tens of thousands of students lost out on university offers. Some launched legal action. What  went wrong   The government announced pupils could appeal using their mock exam results instead. This was called a triple lock - they could use the standardised result, a mock, or a resit, whichever was highest. But this descended into farce as a whole weekend passed with no system for this in place. Ofqual, the exams regulator, issued guidance on Saturday but it was withdrawn after it went against the triple lock. What is todayaposs change  The government has now announced all GCSE, AS and A-level results in England will be based on the teachersapos original predicted grades . Or,youaposre in the small minority of students whose revised grade was higher than your predicted grade , you can keep the higher, revised grade. In other words, every single downgrade that was applied last week - around , of them - has officially been scrapped. Similar announcements with dferent details have already been made for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Essentially, the standardised grading system is now dead. Kaput. Zip. Gone. What about BTechs  Btechs are not included in todayaposs announcement for England. Gavin Williamson said he hoped the pledge will be extended to cover BTechs but it was not ready yet. He said: We very much want to include them on that. “We want to ensure there’s a maximum amount of fairness for youngsters right across the board. “There’s quite a bit of dference because there’s very little disparity in terms of the assessment of grades, of those who took BTechs and other vocational and technical qualications. “But we want to see parity right across the board in terms of how this is approached.” What happens now for students  Students who were preparing a dficult appeal will no longer need to lodge it, as they finally have certainty about what their grade will be. But todayaposs announcement raises as many questions for A-level and GCSE students as it answers. Especially those trying to get into universities - which may not have enough room. They have already rejected many applicants or awarded places to others through Clearing. Will GCSE results still come on Thursday  Yes. The government has said, now that this change is in effect, GCSE results will still be handed out on time this Thursday in England. Now my A-level results have changed, will I still be able to go to my chosen university this year  Itaposs more likely.But itaposs not guaranteed. Now that all students can stick with predicted grades, thousands more cango to their university of choice. But that university might have already rejected that student and offered a place to someone  through Clearing. Gavin Williamson said he would remove the cap on the number of students universities could take, but that doesnapost solve all the problems.The Education Secretary failed to guarantee every pupil will get the uni place they were offered - eventhey now have the right grades.  Askedhe could give that guarantee, Mr Williamson said: “We’re already working very closely with the university sector to make sure that we do everything we can do to build as much capacity in there. “We expect universities to be flexible, we expect them to go above and beyond, to honour those commitments. “But we also recognise, that’s why today we’ve lted student number caps in order for universities to be able to expand and put extra capacity into the system.” Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, said: Todayaposs policy change will mean that more students will have the grades that match the offer of their first choice university. This will cause challenges at this late stage in the admissions process - capacity, staffing, placements and facilities - particularly with the social distance measures in place. We are seeking urgent clarication and advice from Government on a number of crucial issues.  John Craven, Chief Executive of upReach, said: It is not yet clear that all will be able to honour their offers given capacity constraints - eventhe student numbers cap at each university is indeed lted. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “It may already be too late for some A-level students who have already missed out on their first choice of university and course. David Hughes, Chief Executive of the Association of Colleges, said: It is vital that information is provided speedily on how this decision will impact on higher education institutions, students wishing to apply through clearing and those who may have been rejected on their original grades. When will I formally get my new grades  Mr Williamson could not guarantee when formal exam certicates with the updated grades will arrive. But they will come “as swtly as possible”, either in paper or electronic form. GCSE students will not receive their certicates immediately when they pick up results on Thursday. Can I still take re-sitsI want to   The apostriple lockapos promised to students last week included taking re-sits in October to get a higher grade. This was not a new thing and people have been able to take resits in the past. That suggests that yes,your centre assessed grades were poor, you can take a re-sit. The deadline for entry is September . Weaposve asked the Department for Education and Ofqual what the process will be, and plan to update this story when we have more information. Can I still appeal with mock resultsI want to  Mock results will no longer be used in appeals after the government U-turn, Gavin Williamson suggested. He told reporters: “Mock exams won’t form the basis of the appeal process. “We believe obviously we’re going to see a large number of youngsters get a much higher grade than they previously anticipated. “And obviously we’ll have an appeals process that reflects those changed circumstances. “There will understandably be an appeals process, but mocks won’t be forming a key element of that.” Will I be able to appeal against my teacher-predicted grades  Students will be able to appeal their “centre assessment grades”- but the criteria haven’t yet been released. Gavin Williamson said this would be able to happenstudents felt teachers had shown “bias or discrimination” towards them. What happens now for government  Pressure is mounting on Boris Johnson to break off his holiday to deal with the fallout - and for bungling Gavin Williamson to quit. The Education Secretary is   with Ladbrokes to be the next Cabinet minister to leave their post. Meanwhile the fallout of this weekaposs fiasco will be far-reaching and last long beyond today. Getting rid of one problem - crushed grades - has of course created a new problem of grade inflation, which is why the government didnapost want to U-turn in the first place. That could have implications for those taking exams next summer. David Laws, Executive Chairman of the Education Policy Institute , said: The government should immediately establish an independent review of how this yearaposs results were handled, so that we can learn the lessons for the future and not repeat the many errors that have occurred this year. It should also consider the options for exams in , given next yearaposs candidates will have already been affected by the Covid- pandemic and there remains a chance of further lockdowns.

Now she believes it could have saved her le.At just  years old, she was young, fit and – she believed – in perfect health when she collapsed at her home in Essex in May. “I’ve always been into exercise as a way to keep fit and in shape,” says Loren, who worked as a teaching assistant before her travels. ”I was cooling down after doing my usual routine when I felt a sudden pain in my neck. It was very odd – like a big click inside my body. “My first thought was that I’d pulled a muscle, so I went to sit down. But a couple of minutes later, my boyfriend said I was looking a bit odd and passed me a glass of water. “Next thing, I collapsed. I was unconscious for  minutes – and when I started to come round, I couldn’t see.” What Loren thought was a muscle strain was in fact a stroke in the basilar artery of her brain – one of the most potentially devastating types of stroke, fatal in as many as % of cases. For those who survive, these strokes can leave patients with severe disabilities, including head-to-toe paralysis or locked-in syndrome. Yet miraculously, thanks to prompt and expert treatment, Loren is one of the lucky few who escape completely unscathed. Now she believes she’s alive and well because the coronavirus outbreak forced her to curtail her travels.  She was in Thailand, half-way through a two-year trip around the world with her boyfriend Harry Rodell, also , when the pandemic struck, forcing the couple toto the UK. They went into lockdown with Loren’s family in Chadwell St Mary, Essex and were there when Loren collapsed on May . “The paramedics told me that I’d probably had a stroke,” she says. “I thought that sounded pretty crazy, given my age and good health. I thought strokes were something that only happened to old people.”  While most strokes do occur in people aged over , the Stroke Association points out that they can happen at any age, even in babies. Loren was rushed to her nearest hospital in Basildon, where she was treated with clot-busting drugs, then transferred to Queen’s Hospital, Romford, where she underwent a throm-bectomy. The procedure has to be carried out within hours of the stroke and involves inserting a small mesh hook into an artery in the groin, moving it up to the brain and pulling out the blood clot. It only works in a small proportion of stroke cases, but can have a big impact on reducing disability. As a fairly new “game-changing” procedure, it is currently not widely available. Had Loren not been in the UK when she had her stroke, it’s unlikely she would have been able to have the treatment. “The date I had my stroke, I should have been in Cambodia,” says Loren. “There, I wouldn’t have had speedy access to the amazing medical care that we tend to take for granted in this country.” "},{"url":null,"title":"birmingham on road lockdown coronavirus","story":"NewsBirmingham on road to lockdown as coronavirus infection rate doubles in a weekThe West Midlands citys officials are warning coronavirus rates could put it on national lists of areas most likely to require a local lockdown within daysShareCommentsByJane Haynes:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video coronavirus-outbreak-number-deaths-cases-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

The cityaposs coronavirus infection rate has more than doubled in a week - with more than  new cases. Director of public health Dr Justin Varney said it was likely the city would feature in the national watch list of places most at risk of intervention within days. There is no sign of the current rise in Covid- cases easing off - with  new cases in the past week, reports Birmingham Live. We could very easily be in a situation like we have seen in Leicester and Greater Manchester, he said on Monday morning. Both areas have had lockdown restrictions imposed by health secretary Matt Hancock after seeing sustained spikes in infection. Concerns about Birmingham have been triggered by a rapidly rising rate of infections across the city. At the start of the month the city had an infection rate of around  cases per , population. That rose to  by the end of last week, and today stands at aposaround apos, he warned. That was in part due to more people being tested - but there was a real rise in infection transmission, he said. Speaking this morning, Dr Varney said: Looking at the national pattern, we have now overtaken Sandwell- it would not surprise meBirmingham joins that list. He said it was vital that people heeded advice and guidance and stopped flouting recommendations designed to keep the most vulnerable safe. There is much that concerns me, he said. He cited examples of people planning large wedding receptions that they are trying to hide and keep secret, and pass off as people happening to go to the same restaurant at the same time. Birmingham Live earlier reported complaints claiming venues around the city are permitting large gatherings to take place. Dr Varbey also voiced his frustration about growing numbers of illegal parties and street raves, including a gathering of hundreds in the heart of the city this weekend. West Midlands police attended around  gatherings last weekend, and received , calls registering complaints.  Dr Varneyaposs plea was to everyone to be aware that the virus still kills and is still just as infectious - but eventhat message did not land with some people, he warned a local lockdown would also affect jobs and livelihoods. If we have to go back into lockdown local businesses will suffer too. Itaposs about jobs, about kids being able to get back to school - the decisions we make now have an impact on  all of those things. How close is Birmingham to lockdown  The cityaposs infection rate is around . That contrasts with Leicester, which peaked at over  before lockdown restrictions were imposed. But it is now alarmingly close to the situation in Blackburn and Darwen, Lancashire, where signicant restrictions were reintroduced when the rate there reached around . What is driving increase  * Increase in  number of incidents in workplaces  as more go back to work and employees are not being as Covid safe as they should be. Dr Varney said: What we are hearing when we talk to themis that when people are doing their jobs they are keeping the m distance, but when they go for a cigarette break, or lunch, or leave work, they are not. *  Extended family gatherings We are seeing this is also about family gatherings. People are coming together, forgetting to keep their distance, and giving a hug or a handshake - and giving Covid with it, Dr Varney continued.  We have seen some clusters of people in the same extended family but living in dferent households who are sharing infection - and thataposs putting older, more vulnerable people at risk. *  Larger gatherings There is much that concerns me - whether people planning large wedding receptions that they are trying to hide and keep secret, and pass off as people happening to go to the same restaurant at the same time or holding illegal parties and street raves. This virus can still kill people and still just as infectious.

Bomb experts were scrambled to the Haddowsapos Fe home after Billy came across the unexploded First World War hand grenade on the banks of the River Carron and took it back to Alexaposs for a sleepover. Billy and Alex had been out exploring when they discovered what they thought were the preserved remains of an ancient animal or sea creature.Not realising what he had actually found, Billy and Alex took it to the Keseley household for an overnight stay on August , then brought it home to the Haddowsapos the following morning, reports the Daily Record. The bomb squad and police were called to detonate the device in a controlled explosion in a field near Billy’s home at Hill of Beath. Billy, a Beath High School pupil, said: “I thought I’d found a fossil, but my friend told me it was a grenade.“I had waders on and saw it on the river bank. It was on a little island in the middle of the river.”He said: “I thought it looked cool and would be fun to have as a decoration, but I didnapost realise it was live.”He said the police came to his family home to take a look: “They told me that it was live and that it was a bit silly taking it home.“They saidyou find something like that to leave it and call  for advice, and don’t touch it.”Police called in Army explosive specialists who cordoned off the area and blew up the device in a field off Torbeith Road. Billy’s mum Maureen, , said she gave the pair a “rollicking” for bringing the grenade into the house.She said the boys had been told by Alex’s dad to leave it alone, but had smuggled it back to Alex’s home on Friday, August  for their sleepover.Maureen said: “They stayed overnight with it and he showed me it at his brother’s house the next day.

Jonny McNally, , boarded the -passenger capacity Norwegian Jade in September last year for a six month stint cruising around the world. But what was meant to be six months for the assistant cruise director has turned into almost a year after the coronavirus pandemic left him marooned. After leaving County Antrim, Northern Ireland, to live with his girlfriend, Marjorie, , four years ago, Jonny now calls Subic, Philippines, home. But when the country closed its borders in March and Jonnyaposs tourist visa expired in May while stuck at sea, the crewman was left with bills to pay but no way of getting back. Speaking from the ship, which now has just  essential crew onboard, he said today: I was only meant to be on board for six months, I never imagined that I would be here for nearly a year. Follow all coronavirus updates on our live blog here Iaposve done long stints on ships before but at least I had a job to do, now every day has become Groundhog Day. The ship has a capacity of over  passengers but thereaposs only  crew members on board at the moment. If itaposs lunchtime you will see people but I could go a week without seeing anybodyI wanted to. Itaposs very weird and strange to see the ship with so few people on it. It feels like a ghost ship at night time because the lights are dimmed or turned off in places where they wouldnapost usually be soyouaposre walking through the entertainment places everything is covered in white sheets in pitch black, itaposs pretty freaky. When the Covid- pandemic hit, the ship was sailing from Hong Kong to Singapore - but realising early on how serious the situation could become, Jonny asked to terminate his contract early so he could fly home.  After cancelling all their cruises, the passengers disembarked in Singapore and the ship set sail for Dubai in April to allow any remaining crew members to get home. But despite having a flight booked from Dubai to Manilla, on the morning Jonny was due to take off, the journey was cancelled when the city suddenly closed its airports, and the following day the Philippines closed its borders to non-Filipino nationals and visa-holders. With no way of getting into the country to renew his since expired visa, Jonny is now stuck on board the ship, which has been moored in Naples since June - when Italy lted its lockdown.  Jonny has been allowed to remain living in his quarters and receives a £. [ USD] daily allowance from his company to spend on board - but has burned through his savings after his full pay stopped four months ago. Jonny said: I get up in the morning, I go and have lunch and I go and walk around the open deck. I try to get at least , steps in everyday but I do the same thing every day You have to try to be creative in certain ways to stay alert and not get down in the dumps. I still have bills to pay back home and in six weeks I will be totally broke.

Petroperu said in a statement that an agreement had been reached on Saturday between the company and neighboring communities that it would implement social development projects. Jorge Perez, president of the local indigenous rights organization ORPIO who was involved in the negotiations, said a meeting would be held between indigenous leaders, the company and Peru#xs new prime minister Walter Martos in the city of Iquitos, Loreto, on Wednesday. He said the meeting was to discuss potential development projects including the building of a hospital, a highway and an airport and the installation of a state bank branch. #xCThanks to this agreement, we have facilitated theof station  of Petroperu`s pipeline and we trust that the social gaps in the Amazon can be closed,#xD he told Reuters by phone.

Husband and we Chloe-Anne Davey, , and Adam Davey, , from Ilkeston, had booked a £, holiday for them and their three children, eight, six, and four. They were set to spend two weeks at Bideford Bay Holiday Park in Devon, which is a Parkdean resort. They say they had to buy their own cleaning products - and left the resort a day early - due to the aposhorribleapos condition of the caravan. Mouldy mattresses, badly kept showers and a broken fridge greeted the family on August . Full-time mum Mrs Davey told Nottinghamshire Live: This holiday was really important to us as a family due to the fact we had a lot going on. We lost a baby last September and we have both suffered with depression. The holiday was a time to spend as a family and was super special for us. The past year has been heartbreaking.  But the family said the problems began as soon as they arrived at the door of their static caravan. When we first arrived, [there was a] strong smell of mould. There was also general dampness. The shower was mouldy and the fridge was broken. My four-year-old is asthmatic and was sleeping on the sofa bed. It was full of black mould. It was vile.  She said they immediately complained and were told it was because the caravan was under trees. An upgrade was agreed but they had to wait a week before moving into it as there was no availability until then. Mrs Davey added: We do not think the cleaning measures were taken to a professional standard, let alone a Covid standard. During a pandemic, the hygiene should be topnotch.  They moved into the second caravan only to find other problems, including no frying pans, bins for their rubbish and aposthick black grimeapos on the doors and shower. Despite making complaints, and leaving a day early due to the alleged state of the caravan, they still have not received an apology from the company. It has ruined our holiday, said Mrs Davey.

It struck me as odd, an adult engaging in a childhood pastime. Was I wrong! Adult colouring books have flooded bookshops everywhere in the last few years with their empty patterns of mandalas, animals and floral designs. But what makes them so popular  Colouring can help you channel your inner artist, de-stress and bring a sense of peace. But is there truly a benefit of colouring for adults  And does this pastime please and calm our brains  According to ­clinical psychologist Scott M Bea at ­Cleveland Clinic, Ohio, US, it’s all about refocusing our attention. “Adult colouring requires modest attention focused outside of self-awareness,” Dr Bea says. “It’s a simple activity that takes us outside ourselves in the same way as cutting the lawn, knitting or taking a Sunday drive.” How  Dr Bea cites three reasons why adult colouring can be calming. Attention flows away from ourselves with a simple absorbing act such as colouring. Your attention concentrates on the present moment. “In this way, it is very much like a meditative ­exercise,” Dr Bea says. It also relaxes the brain when thoughts are focused on a simple activity like colouring. “The dficulties of le evaporate from your awareness, and both your body and your brain may find this rewarding.” Low stakes make it pleasurable, especially colouring inside the lines.“It is hard to screw up colouring, and, evenyou do, there is no real consequence. Adult colouringcan be a wonderful escape, rather than a demanding test of our capacities,” he adds."},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByDave Masters:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The story goes that Brad Pitt’s parents, Jane and William, have allegedly not seen their grandchildren since , because of a rt with their mother Angelina Jolie. For my kids, a spell that long away from such influential figures in their lives would be unacceptable. When my better half and I next take a few days off, we will have no compunction about trusting our little ones with their grandparents. The kids will demand it and rightly so. New research showing half of all mothers and fathers have fallen out with their own parents over the grandkids is symptomatic of the breakdown in our society. You only have to look at some of the areas over which they are fighting – discipline, manners, eating habits and screen time. It spooks me to consider just how old I sound saying this, but take a ride on a bus sometime – particularly before or after school – and observe the behaviour of some of today’s youngsters, particularly towards the older generation.  Listen to the language, observe the lack of respect. Then compare it to the way you treated your elders growing up. Consider how many of those kids would benefit from the traditional values on which we were raised. Yes, of course we want to be progressive in the way we bring up our kids. Yetwe are honest we’d all admit to bones of contention with our parents over which they were ultimately proven right. Nor would they approve of the way that iPads and iPhones are used as virtual babysitters now. Studies have shown, too, that extended periods of time with grandparents increases a child’s emotional intelligence and positively affects the way that they relate to their elders. It extends their vocabulary with grandparents taking the time to play and read books while parents are busy working. Time with the elders leaves a child more likely to understand their family history with grandparents able to provide context and perspective.

The government was forced to backtrack on its controversial Covid- awards process, announcing that teachersapos predictions would now stand. It came after tens of thousands of students saw their results downgraded by Ofqualaposs heavily-criticised algorithm. But it remains unclear what happens now with university applications, with many teens having missed out on their first choice because of the governmentaposs shambolic handling of results. Alaa Muhammad, who had faced missing out on her dream of studying medicine in Pakistan after being downgraded, said: I am ecstatic, I am so so happy. I was so hopeless a couple of days ago and now I feel like I can finally breathe again.Did you miss out on a place at university because of downgrading  Email us at  webnews@trinitymirror    Ms Muhammad, from south-east England, had seen her grades fall from a predicted ABB to EDD due to the heavily criticised algorithm. The stark drop saw her post an emotional plea on Twitter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. I deserve to know why you have ruined my chance at le. Why I donapost feel like living anymore. Why I feel like all my hard work and money has gone to waste, she wrote in the tweet, which was retweeted more than , times. Ms Muhammad said she had paid more than £, to take resits at a private college after her studies in year  and  were disrupted.  She now hopes she will be able to find a university place after all. Journalist Lucinda Day fumed that a brilliant Sixth Form student she mentored had missed out on university places - which have since been filled. She wrote: The brilliant state school student I mentored over the past year, had her predicted A-level results downgraded from A* A A to A C C and lost her place to study law at Exeterchoice  Edinburgh . Now the govt have u-turned  the university places have gone. Being awarded what she undoubtedly would have achieved anywayis little consolation when you’re still unable to take up the university place you worked so hard for.  The incompetence of this govt impalpable. Sana Ahmed fears she has missed out her dream place studying law at the University of Birmingham. She was offered a conditional place after earning AAC grades in her mocks, although her teacher assessed grades were ABC. She has not had the chance to prove she can do better. Sana, who studied for her A-levels in Halesowen, Birmingham, toldtoday: If they had gone with my mock results rather than an opinion of someone  or an algorithm I would had a much better chance of being accepted.As a result, she said, the next year of her le has been flushed down the loo by others. In a letter to Birmingham University, she wrote: It is evident that I was on course to achieve the grades you required, had I not been cheated of the opportunity to sit the final exams, only one A-Level grade needed to be improved from my mock to have the required AAB. Student Thomas Jukes, who missed out on a place to study medicine at the University of Birmingham due to his A-level results being downgraded, questioned why the rubbish algorithm was used in the first place. Iaposm much more pleased now I have got my centre-assessed grades. Itaposs just dependent now on whether my places have been held, he told the PA news agency. If they managed to turn around in four days and say, aposwell, you can just have your centre-assessed gradesapos, it wouldnapost have been that much hassle in the first place, would it  I think they put a lot of time and effort into this rubbish algorithm, which has been a monumental failure, to just literally give us what the teachers predicted us anyway.  The -year-old, from Great Barr in Birmingham, said that he contacted the university as soon as he found out the news in the hope that his place had been held. I just gave them a call and they said they canapost update us at this time, more information will be on the website soon, that kind of thing, he added.One A-level student posted on Twitter that the hard work and stress she had put in was finally recognised.She wrote: I am OVER THE MOON!!! on results day I wasn’t happy. I didn’t get the results I deserve with  UCAS points I was looking at foundation years resitting. But now I have more than enough UCAS points for uniand all the hard work and stress is recognised.  Yasmin Walker, who said she wasnapost planning to go to uni but had friends who had missed out on their top choices, wrote: Spaces are full  it won’t fix the stress they’ve been put through already. Absolute shambles. Fawad Sajid, , of Kingsbury, north-west London, said the Governmentaposs U-turn was late but it is better late than never. Standing outside the Education Department in central London, he said: For the greater good, this change is definitely a step in the right direction but I still feel there needs to be a process in which students can appeal against their teachersapos . Some students will naturally feel that having that assessment is not fair either. These appeals need to be treated on a case-by-case basis.

Emily Maylin, , from Ongar, was told she had leukemia aged just three after suffering a bout of chicken pox. Everything had been fine until her mum Jenny noticed she seemed to be taking longer than normal to recover. Her skin had become a sickly pale and she was unusually tired - not her usual bouncy self, reports EssexLive. When Emilyaposs hand started to swell up, her parents knew something wasnapost quite right. A trip to the hospital sent Emily to Addenbrookeaposs Hospital in Cambridge for blood tests which came back with news they could never have prepared themselves for. Emily was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, a blood cancer which can progress quickly and aggressively. For the next two years of her le, Emily was in hospital with her family having chemotherapy and treatment. As the youngest child of four, Emily was the last of her siblings to get chicken pox. Jenny had no initial concerns when Emily caught the infection, but started to become worried when she wasnapost improving. She had that period of chicken pox and didnapost seem to recover, the -year-old said. All my other children had got better but Emily didnapost get back to herself. But there was nothing particularly noticeable, although she was falling asleep a lot. What led us to the diagnosis was she had a swollen hand. We took her to the doctors and they couldnapost see anything on her hand that seemed to be causing the problem. One of the things which made me query at the doctors was why she was so pale, her skin was almost translucent. We were sent home to keep an eye but I went back next day because her hand was getting worse and there were red blotches up her arm. They sent her for a blood test and we got a result back the same day. The family were told to take Emily off to Addenbrookeaposs Hospital in Cambridge with some clothes to stay over in. After several more tests and checks, the hospital confirmed that Emily had leukemia. It was pretty upsetting, Jenny said. I didnapost really know what the treatment was, or what they could do or what the survival rates were. Itaposs come a long way since then. Being only three at the time, Emily said she can only really remembers the dficult parts. I donapost remember an awful lot, but I remember the negative bits, Emily said. I remember the injections in the hospital and having to drive there from my home and being woken up in middle of the night to go to hospital.  And having my hickman line taken out and just lying and screaming really and the constant blood tests. I remember some of the nurses being really lovely though. The next two years of Emilyaposs le revolved around the hospital, blood tests and chemotherapy to make sure she got better. I remember mum slept on a bed that pulled down next to mine, so she was next to me, Emily said. I remember being sick quite a bit and my mouth being wiped. The impact on Emily at such a young age naturally affected her, where she would be woken up in the middle of the night for more blood tests and taking a mix of drugs from chemotherapy and steroids. It wasnapost easy but the staff at the hospital were phenomenal, Jenny said. They were so dedicated and the doctors were very good at telling us exactly what were the treatments and what was happening. Emily had just begun play school a few weeks before she caught chicken pox and was subsequently diagnosed with leukemia and didnapost . Returning for primary school, things were a little dferent to make sure Emily was safe. I had a medical box at infant school forI fell over, Emily explained One time I ran into a fence and cut my knee and they said Emily has to go to the teacheraposs head office where I had my knee cleaned. It was with anything with blood becauseit gets infected it can be very dangerous. I remember being at school and knowing something was dferent about me. I had short hair and they used to think I was a boy. For the next ten years after treatment, Emily visited the hospital for regular check-ups. Where I was a bit confused, I didnapost understand what had happened really, I didnapost see any worries, Emily said. I was just a normal kid and wanted normal things. When I got a bit older, as a teen you start to worryit does come back and you understand a bit more about it. Itaposs not the easiest thing to come out of the other side, having had chemo, I did get ill quite badly a few times because I had a lowered immune system. Now, Emily and her sister, Amy Maylin, are trying to raise as much money as possible for Blood Cancer UK to help others with le-threatening cancers.

Some parents might get pretty anxious about putting their little one in the water, but one mum has really been enjoying going with her six-month-old son to a baby swim class. Or at least she was having a good time until she had an unpleasant conversation with a fellow mum.She recounted the negative experience in a post on Reddit, explaining how most of the other people in the pool with her during the class were dads and their wives sat on the side to watch.She claimed everything was going swimmingly at the last session, until the very end. As she was getting ready to leave the pool, one of the fellow mums who had been watching came over to chat. The woman proceeded to complain about the mumaposs swimming costume, suggesting it wasnapost appropriate attire for the class.Writing on Reddit, in a post which has since been deleted, the stunned mum explained what happened, saying: Today, there was a new baby at swim class! He looked to be about the same age as my son. As the father got into the pool, he said hi and I ed the greeting. I then asked him how old his son was and we made about  seconds of small talk before the class started. After class was over and my son and I were leaving the pool area, this man’s we approached me and said, aposYou know,you are going to continue to swim with husbands and fathers, you should really dress more modestlyapos.  The mum in the pool had been wearing a tankini, a two-piece swimsuit with a tank top and high-waisted bottoms.She described the swimming costume and shared a link to an identical one which is for sale on Amazon. You could see maybe three inches of my stomach, she said. And not that it matters, but I am completely flat chested with no butt, so it’s not like my voluptuous curves were a distraction or anything. The mum added that she was caught completely off guard by the womanaposs comment and didnapost know how to respond, so just thanked her for her opinion.

The approved bill allows the production, commercialisation and supply of chlorine dioxide solution to prevent COVID- and as a treatment for sick patients. Chlorine dioxide is usually used as a disinfectant or to whiten paper products but in recent years it has been hailed as a miracle cure which is able to treat most illness and health conditions by conspiracy theorists and alternative medicine advocates. Calling it Miracle Mineral Solution or MMS the belief is claimed to be gaining influence in Latin America where countries are struggling to cope with the coronavirus pandemic.  There have been cases across Bolivia of people being hospitalised after taking chlorine dioxide, Business Insider reports.Boliviaaposs own ministry of health has warned people not to take it and will prosecute anyone producing and selling it. In June medical regulators in the country released a statement warning that chlorine dioxide puts the health of the population that consumes or intends to do so at serious risk.It added that the US Food and Drug Administration says it has recorded reports of severe vomiting, severe diarrhoea, le-threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration and acute liver failure after drinking these products. Both houses of the Bolivian parliament are controlled by the left-wing MAS party, which also used to control the presidency. But the MAS president Evo Morales was ousted last year following allegations of election fraud so the role is currently held by the caretaker government of the opposition conservative Jeanine Añez. Sergio Verdugo, an Associate Professor of Universidad del Desarrollo Law School, Chile, told Business Insider that under the Bolivian constitution Añez can either approve or reject bill. Butshe rejects it the legislative assembly can override her decisionthere is an absolute majority of legislators there when the vote takes place.  The passing of the bill could strain relations between Añez and Boliviaaposs legislators weeks before the countryaposs delayed presidential election which will take place on October . It was originally scheduled for September , but the president delayed them over fears of coronavirus spreading.

It#s quite a covered place, mostly teenagers sit there.#We#ve had slats actually removed with saws, we#ve had boards ripped off the clubhouse.

Nursing students worked on extended placements, allied health professionals including physiotherapy, occupational therapy and radiography students stepped into health care support worker roles until they were able to work as fast track graduates and final year medical students graduated early to work as interim foundation year one doctors.#Students signicant contribution and rapid adaption to the new circumstances is sincerely appreciated.June Brown, interim deputy director of nursing, added: #A core role for NHS Grampian is being an education provider, and one we consider of great importance.#We very quickly recognised as we started to plan for the remobilisation phase of Covid- that preparing for the new academic year and students ing to NHS Grampian was a very high priority.#Without students we have no future workforce so it was important for us to prioritise working to get this right.#Our students will be ing to this environment of unpredictability and change and will not have experienced working clinically yet in this new world.

This experience of designing an affordable dwelling could be a long-time solution to provide shelter and preserve people#s dignity by offering them just what they need.”Neil Clapperton, chief executive of Grampian Housing Association said: “The project is completely aligned to our objectives of providing affordable sustainable homes to meet people’s housing needs.“It is an enlightening experience being involved in the project and the high quality of work of the students is to be commended.”Board chairman of Grampian Housing Association and RGU lecturer, Abhishek Agarwal, added: “Through this project we are hoping that we are able to support our communities by driving the agenda for affordable, innovative and sustainable homes, but at the same time offering support for skills development in the built environment.”All of the projects will be exhibited in a virtual exhibition later in the year.The public can view and vote for each of the student designs here.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them.

But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle. This proposal, like many others, was defeated in the House of Lords.Instead, provision was made at Dalmally for a waiting room, the #Duke’s Room#, at Dalmally Station where visitors arriving by train could await the arrival of a carriage in comfort.This is just one of innumerable fascinating stories stored within the Argyll Papers, the family and estate archive of the Campbell family, dukes of Argyll.The Friends of the Argyll Papers was established to support the development of the archive and to promote its use and enjoyment by a wide audience.It has been described as one of the most important private archives in Britain, offering a rich resource for Scottish and British history from the th to the st centuries.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

Reduce light from the hall. Make sure there are no electronics sending out light e.g. a digital alarm clock with a lit display, sleep buttons on equipment etc.\"You may want to put black curtains at the window or wear an eye mask to limit the light getting into the eye.\"Sleep Scotland suggests wearing an eye maskOn the other end, you should also get lots of light in the morning to help you feel awake and alert.They added: \"Exposure to light at the right time helps keep the circadian clock on the correct time schedule.\"Make sure you open the curtains and turn on the lightsyou need to. Going for a walk is a great way to start the day.\"RoutineIt is only natural that during lockdown many of us have found that we have lost our routine and have been staying up later and lying in bed longer in the morning.Sleep Scotland said: \"Your body clock works best when you stick to a schedule.\"In an ideal world, yoursquoll go to sleep and wake up within a half hour of the same time each day, even on weekends.\"The routines of the day also give us powerful signals and demands that the body remain alert for certain tasks and events.\"Regular waking and bed times, alongside regular meal times are very important for regulating your body and its s.\"Sleep PressureSleep pressure is the term used to describe the feeling of tiredness we have, due to the activity we undertake through the day.,params: .pushSleep Scotland say it is important to be active in order to make sure we create the sleep pressure and drowsiness that will help us to fall asleep.They argue that having a nap can relieve our sleep pressure, meaning we find it harder to fall asleep at bedtime.Take a tech breakNaturally during lockdown many of us have resorted to using screens to help keep us entertained,to work and to socialise with friends.And while most modern tech has a blue light filter, it does not filter all light.More importantly, the things you do online are usually things that stimulate your brain and make it harder to turn off when you get into bed.Therefore, Sleep Scotland say you should unplug from all screens at least an hour before bedtime.They added: \"In the hour before bed, ensure you focus on doing things that are calming.\"Now is the time to read, draw, do some calming exercises, have a warm bath etchellip\""},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-needs-20mph-speed-limit","story":"A MPH

of cometary dust - producing up to  meteors every hour.If skies are clear, the display of celestial fireworks should be visible across the UK from about midnight tonightuntil .am UK time on Thursday, August  - according to astronomers at Royal Observatory Greenwich.What are the Perseids The astronomical event is associated with the dusty debris left by Comet Swt-Tuttle, which orbits the sun once every  years.The meteoroids from the comet, mostly no bigger than a grain of sand, burn up as they hit the Earthrsquos atmosphere at  miles per second to produce a shooting stream of light in the sky.Peak temperatures can reach anywhere from ,C to ,C as they speed across the sky.The meteors are called Perseids because they seem to dart out of the constellation Perseus.The meteor shower began on July  and will continue to be visible until August .What have astronomers said Anna Ross, an astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, said the best time to spot the meteors is between midnight and .am on Thursday, when up to  meteors or ldquoshooting stars will be visible per hour, which is more than one every second.She told the PA news agency: ldquoThis makes the Perseids one of the most impressive meteor showers of the year.ldquoDuring the peak night of the shower, you will be able to find it in the north-east of the sky, getting higher throughout the night.ldquoYou donrsquot have to be able to see Perseus to spot meteors, however, as they will be moving away from the radiant across the whole sky in every direction.To make the most of the meteors, Ms Ross said observers should avoid well-lit and built-up areas and try to find an unobstructed view to the east.She added: ldquoFind a dark area and allow around  minutes for your eyes adapt to the dark.ldquoAs meteors move quite fast across the sky itrsquos best to look up without using telescopes or binoculars so you can see as much of the sky as possible.How regular will the meteors be The Perseids are one of the more active meteor showers on stargazersrsquo calendars, producing an average of between  and  shooting stars an hour at their peak.The shower in rsquos was especially active, delivering up to  meteors an hour at its height.While the shooting stars this year wonrsquot be quite as regular, stargazers can still expect to see around  of them an hour.Do I need special equipment to see the Perseids Meteor showers are typically visible with the naked eye, so no special equipment is needed, but those in rural areas with minimal light pollution will have a clearer view.Heading out to a dark spot is the best plan of action, but stargazers should allow around  minutes for their eyes to become accustomed to the dark.Patience is also a virtue, with shooting stars tending to appear in clusters, followed by a lull.The meteors will appear to come from the direction of the Perseus constellation in the north eastern part of the sky, although they should be visible from any point.A cloudy night could still scupper your chances of spotting any meteors, however, so keep your eye on weather forecasts."},{"url":null,"title":"confident-borders-schools-safe-says-council-chief","story":"THE leader of Scottish Borders Council says she has \"every confidence\" that schools have been made safe

With food storage at a premium, you dont want to let anything go to waste.Wersquove done the legwork to figure out the right ways to store your food so that it tastes best and lasts the longest.Here are the answers to ten common kitchen storage mistakes.. Youre throwing out your lsquoexpiredrsquo foodCertain expiration dates have less to do with safety than they do quality. Credit: Getty   FangXiaNuoItrsquos important to know the dference between food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo date and food that has passed the lsquoUse byrsquo date. You should never eat food that has passed its lsquoUse byrsquo date, but lsquoBest Beforersquo dates often reflect quality control, not safety or nutritional value. In determiningthe food that has passed the lsquoBest Beforersquo is safe to eat read up on Food Standards Agency guidelines, use your eyes and nose, and follow your gut.Smell:If it smells fine and it was stored properly, its likely okay to eat.Sight:Donrsquot let your eyes fool you when it comes to fresh food like produce. Bumps or bruises donrsquot mean something is ruined.Dont can the cans:Canned goods can last for decades. Even a can thats started to rust should still be okay, as long as it isnt bulging and the seal is intact.Check the packaging, use your senses, cook food thoroughly, and donrsquot let the perfect become the enemy of the good. A proper understanding of expirationdates could drastically cut down on food wastemdashnot to mention wasted money out of your pocket.. Youre using plastic wrap to save your leftoversBees Wrap can be used to store anything from biscuits to sandwiches. But not soup... yet.

Surprised . You dont know how to store your cooking oilsSome cooking oils are best stored in the cabinet, while others can be refrigerated. Credit: Getty   Angelina ZinovievaCooking oils sourced from fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds each have dferent storage needs. Exposure to oxygen, light or heat will subject oil to oxidation, eventually turning it rancid. While some cooking oils can be stored at room temperature, others do best when stored in the fridge.Corn and rapeseed oils:These do just fine stored in a cool, dark cabinet, or you can refrigerate themit takes more than a year to get through a bottle.Olive oil:Leaving olive oil out on the counter or a table, especiallythe bottle gets direct sunlight, or storing it on or near a stove are surefire ways to turn it rancid quickly. Place it in the coolest, darkest place in your home or use a smaller glass bottle in the kitchen.Peanut oil:Can be kept for as long as two yearsstored tightly capped and away from heat and light. Keeping peanut oil in the fridge may extend shelf le even further.Coconut oil:Very stable andhas a shelf le of two years or more.Avocado, grapeseed, hazelnut, sesame, truffle, walnut, safflower and sunflower:Delicate oils that are especially prone to rancidity, especiallyexposed to too much light or heat. Refrigerating after opening is recommended. Kept cold, these oils will remain viable for six months or more.. Youre using the wrong containers to store your foodWe tested the best-selling plastic and glass food storage containers on the market to find the best of the lot. We dropped them onto a linoleum floor, froze them, microwaved them, stained them, pried them apart, stacked them back together, and lots more.Best glass container:Pyrexs Cook and Eat Glass Storage Setisa great choice. Food wont leak, and the glass wont shatter. While the BPA-free lids maystain, they will come clean after a run in the dishwasher. Therersquos a vent for microwave reheats and, as long as the contents are defrosted, itrsquos also preheated oven safe.Best plastic container:Rubbermaidrsquos Easy Find Lidscontainers wonrsquot spring a leak unless you shake them violently, and drops arenrsquot a problem unless the container happens to fall on its side or a corner. No plastic container is oven-safe, but the set is marked dishwasher- and microwave-safe and carries a letime warranty. You should avoid freezing this set, as expanding food may pop the lid.. Youre incorrectly storing fruits and veggiesDo you know which vegetables should stay at room temperature, which should be kept inside a salad drawer, and which should never be stored together  Are you sure Do not refrigerate:Potatoes, onions, garlic, winter squash, tomatoes, bananas, peaches, plums, avocados, mangoes, melons, apples, pears, kiwis, and citrus. Exceptions include freezing for smoothies, or refrigerating for brief periods when theyre close to spoiling.Keep separate:Produce that emits high levels of ethylene gas, including ripe bananas, apples, stone fruit , cantaloupe, honeydew melons, mangoes, pears, ripe kiwis, tomatoes, onions, and leeks.Store alone:Ethylene-sensitive produce, including aubergine, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrots, caullower, cucumber, leafy greens, peas, peppers, squash, sweet potatoes, strawberries, and watermelon.,params: .push. Youre letting your avocados turn brownThere are many ways to store a cut avocado, but only one that will actually keep it from browning and preserve the flavour: Leave the pit in an avocado, and tightly wrap the half in plastic wrap to keep the flavour and texture intact.. Youre letting the food in your fridge accidentally freezeFoods in your fridge shouldnt be freezing. Credit: Getty   IssaurinkoBiting into frozen food thatrsquos merely supposed to be refrigerated isnrsquot just annoying: Freezing can completely alter the taste and texture of your food. And itrsquos probably because yoursquore probably arranging your fridge the wrong way.Check your fridges temperature settings:The ideal temperature range for the interior of your fridge is degC and below.Determine problem areas:According to appliance manufacturer GE, the most common problem areas are the top shelf, the bottom of the fridge , and door shelves.Avoid vents:Most fridges have a cooling vent above the top shelf. This is where most of the cold air comes from, so keeping food away from here may prevent freezing. Adjust your freezer:Turn up your freezer temperature settings, but nothing north of degF, which will facilitate bacterial growth and accelerate food spoilage.Check your ice maker:Make sure that your ice maker is not constantly running. This could make your freezer too cold and subsequently cause your refrigerated foods to freeze.Stock up your fridge:Refrigerators need to be well-stocked to absorb all of the cold air being vented into the cavity. If it is relatively empty, all of the cold air will sink to the bottom of the cavity and freeze your food. A fully stocked fridge will help maintain temperatures and, as a result, use less energy.. Youre not fixing a door that wont shut properlyIf your fridge door wont close, its probably due to an old, dried-out gasket, the rubber seal that runs along its edge. Luckily, the fix is simple: wash the gasket, and apply petroleum jelly to the rubber to revitalize the old rubber.. Youre not regulating your fridges temperatureA full fridge will help keep the temperature consistent. Credit: Getty   Group StudioDid you know your fridge could actually be making you sick  To keep food out of what the Food Saftey Agency calls lsquothe danger zonersquo, it needs to remain below degC. The freezer should be set to -degC to keep freezer burn at bay. If your fridge and freezer are regularly warmer than those temperatures, yoursquore risking faster spoilage. Here are a few things you can do to keep your fridge properly chilled:Invest in a fridge thermometer.To use, place the thermometer in a cup of water. Why  Your refrigerator measures the temperature of the air around your food, but you want to simulate the temperature inside your foods. Check the thermometer after  hours and then, adjust the temperature of each appliance based on the results.Check to make sure the gasket is in good shape, and seals well.If you can open the door with one finger, your seal isnt tight enough. A leaky seal is an energy waster, and may be a risk to your food.Dust your refrigerators cooling coils,theyre visible. You can use a long, skinny brush made for this purpose.Cover your food.For example, leave eggs in their carton, not in the door.Keep a full fridgeto retain the cold, but leave enough room for air to circulate.The product experts at Reviewedhave all your shopping needs covered.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses.

This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

year for students because of the coronavirus pandemic and teachers were asked to submit expected grades for each senior pupil based on prelim results and course work.However, the Scottish Qualications Authorityreviewed the submissions and using a lsquostatistical modelrsquo, which took into account the historic exam performances of schools, downgraded thousands of submitted grades, causing a national outrage.In East Lothian, , pupils received some grades which had been marked down.Only  of the , young people who were due to sit SQA exams had any of their final grades increased.The results dropped through letterboxes last Tuesday and sparked a furious backlash from students who received lower grades than expected.Erin Campbell, , Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor Musselburgh, said many friends had been left worried and scared after the initial results came out, warning that the fiasco had been ldquobad for their mental health.Erin, who was a sixth-year student at Musselburgh Grammar School, said: ldquoOn a personal level, I was lucky to receive the results that I needed in order to move on to university however, I am aware of a lot of young people, including close friends, who were left scared and worried after not receiving a conditional offer to uni that was reliant on these results.ldquoThis badly impacted their mental health, particularly during the period of uncertainty before [Education Secretary] John Swinneyrsquos announcement [on Tuesday].Student protests were held in Glasgow and Edinburgh and politicians piled on pressure for the Scottish Government to step in and overturn the results.East Lothian MSP Iain Gray, Labourrsquos education spokesperson, called on Mr Swinney to resign after he initially backed the modied results before bending under pressure and telling the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday the Scottish Government had got it wrong.Mr Swinney said it was ldquodeeply regrettable we got this wrong and ordered the SQA to amend awards which had been marked down back to the submitted grade provided by teachers and reissue them.Mr Gray said Mr Swinney had spent five days defending the results before changing his position on Tuesday, asking him: ldquoWhy did he defend the results of this moderation for five days  Why did he leave these young people twisting in the wind for a week, hopes and aspirations in shreds Speaking after the decision, Mr Gray said: ldquoGiven the scale of the exam results scandal, it was inevitable that many local students would have been affected. I have certainly had a number of young people and parents contacting me over the last week to express their concerns about their grades being adjusted down by the SQA and the impact it might have on their futures.ldquoThe Scottish Governmentrsquos u-turn will bring relief to these worried young people and their families as they will now see their estimated results reinstated.ldquoHowever, the fact remains they should not have had to experience this worry and uncertainty in the first place. The Education Secretary has let them down and should be held accountable for this fiasco.Schools in East Lothian were yesterdaycontacting pupils who had been affected to let them know they would receive new awards.Across the county, , grades were submitted to the SQA for pupils at the end of May across National , Higher and Advanced Higher level by their teachers.In total, , were acceptedwith  adjusted upand ,adjusted down.In terms of pupils who were due to sit the exams, the council said just over  per cent saw at least one grade marked down.Councillor Shamin Akhtar , cabinet spokesperson for education and childrenrsquos services, said: ldquoIrsquom delighted that John Swinney has finally decided to do the right thing for pupils on the exam results fiasco.ldquoYoung people have faced a very tough and stressful time already and this is something they should never have had to go through.ldquoSchool staff worked extremely hard to submit grades for their pupils to the SQA and the adjustments undermined their professional judgement.ldquoThis u-turn is a victory for young people who have led the campaign against the unfair results and should be commended for standing up for their rights.And Councillor Craig Hoy , a member of East Lothianrsquos education committee, said: ldquoI am delighted that grades have been restored to hardworking pupils in East Lothian who faced huge uncertainty over the last week for no good reason.ldquoEveryone can see that John Swinney has presided over a litany of failures, any one of which could have been a resignation issue on its own.ldquoThe SNP defended their appalling grading system to the hilt, even after it became clear that pupils, parents and teachers had no confidence in the system.On Monday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon issued an apology to students across the country who had been marked down by the SQA.She said: ldquoOur concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant too many students feel they have lost out on grades they should have had, and that that has happened not as a result of anything they have done but a statistical model or algorithm.ldquoDespite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and I am sorry.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council welcomed the u-turn, adding: ldquoThroughout this process our schools have sought to represent the academic achievements of our young people in a way that provided a fair and accurate reflection of attainment using the guidance and methodology provided by the SQA.ldquoThe announcement by the Education Secretary will be welcomed by young people who saw their results downgraded, and by our teachers and schools who used their professional judgement when providing grade estimates.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskillpledged his support to headteachers in a letter at the end of last week after the original results came out.He said: ldquoI welcome the Scottish Governmentrsquos announcement.ldquoAs I said last week in a letter to East Lothianrsquos headteachers, I believe the people best placed to know about pupils are those overseeing and working alongside them during their academic journeys.ldquoThis decision is the right one, and I want to send my congratulations to all students in East Lothian for the work they have achieved both before and during this pandemic, as well as a huge thanks to the teachers and school support staff who have worked so hard over the last few months."},{"url":null,"title":"betrayal-claim-mcdonalds-musselburgh-recommended-approval","story":"In a letter to the Courier, Fraser McAllister hit out at their ldquoillogical recommendation which,approved by councillors at an online meeting next week, would grant permission for a restaurant to be created in the car park of the Tesco store off Olivebank Road.He claimed that the drive-thru, which would operate  hours a day, seven days a week, would be ldquonext to the most congested roundabout in the county.The former SNP councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"wavegarden-scotland-surf-resort-takes-step-closer-reality----looks-unreal","story":"Artists drawings of the plans for Wavegarden Scotland show the extent of the project - which is hoped to create  jobs and generate up to poundmillion for the local economy every year.The visitor attraction is planned for the disused Craigpark Quarry near Ratho on the outskirts of Edinburgh.Artist impressions for the food and retail hubsThe project will involve the installation of underwater technology that can create , waves per hour, from slow moving white water for beginners through to powerful barrels up to two metres high for experts.Yesterday, the teams developer confirmed it had been backed by planners to include a food and retail hub, as well as glamping pods for accommodation.Tartan Leisure Ltd, developers of Scotlandrsquos first articial surf park, Wavegarden Scotland, received planning permission today.

Essentially, this means there should be no way of telling yoursquove been there ndash no litter, no signs of fires, no damage to trees or other elements of the environment.This is a good example of wild campingSome very conscientious campers take this further by removing litter left by others, i.e. the site looks better for them having been there. Hats off to these heroes.If it can sometimes be dficult to define what wild camping is, itrsquos easier to say what it isnrsquot.It isnrsquot pitching a tent in a car park, and it certainly isnrsquot turning up with your entire family and friends and a car full of glamping kit and or lager.It may also surprise some people, but responsible wild camping would not include an open fire at least not in certain areas. SOAC states that you should ldquonever light an open fire during prolonged dry periods or in areas such as forests, woods, farmland... So, fires in the woods are in breach of the code, as are fires anywhere during dry periods.If yoursquore desperately in need of a fire, the place to have it is on the beach.Itrsquos also a good idea to bring your own wood. Collecting fuel on-site isnrsquot a good thing, as dead wood is a valuable part of ecosystems. Cutting branches from trees may constitute vandalism and anyway, green wood burns really badly.Perhaps itrsquos also important to think about the ethos behind wild camping.As mentioned, truly wild camping should have an intrinsic respect for, and minimal impact on, the natural environment.At some of our sites, wersquove seen a huge increase in camping in recent years.Many of those involved are reasonably responsible campers, fires aside, that is, leaving little or no litter.However, the cumulative effect of such a high density of campersis to slowly degrade the natural environment.Then, of course, therersquos the issue of where all these people are going to the toilet, but letrsquos not dwell on that.So, perhaps it just needs a little more thought on the part of the campers.Some sites are simply inappropriate ndash Aberlady Bay and Traprain Law, for example, being a nature reserve and scheduled monument respectively.Others may be OK sometimes, but not when busy.Under these circumstances, it may be that prospective campers should think about choosing another venue.Right, rant over normal service will be resumed next month."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-clifftop-castle-tales","story":"I have always wanted to visit it, but never seemed to get the opportunity then suddenly, a day of sunny weather last week combined with some free time made a trip possible.The walk to the castle was stunning, with purple heather-clad braes and a sparkling sea. To add to the magic, we saw dolphins as we approached the ruins.There is actually little left of the castle itself: small chunks of masonry jutting out like broken teeth are the only obvious evidence to the existence of the clf-top fortress.But itrsquos the location, and the stories attached to it, which tingle the spine.Itrsquos a steep descent to it, and care needs to be taken as you near the castle, for the path veers dangerously close to the edge of the clfs.We took it gradually, with a distant view of the ruins enticing us. A solid cement walkway now links the promontory to the mainland, where once a drawbridge gave access to the castle. The kids crossed it, one by one, with help from me and my we Kate. Itrsquos at this point, as you enter the historic remains, that the power of the location is truly revealed.Itrsquos like walking into lsquothe godsrsquo of a giant natural amphitheatre, with clfs looming on both sides, and sheer drops below. The sound of the open sea and gulls swamp your senses, and I was thankful we had visited when it was calm, for I can imagine a visit on a windy day would give the precipitous edges an almost terrying character. We settled down for our picnic where once the great hall stood, with breathtaking views.Whenever I visit such places, itrsquos not just what is seen that inspires me itrsquos the stories of the place. Here the ghosts of the past wait to tell you their tale,you have an ear to listen. And what tales are sewn onto this rocky top!The castle gets its first mention in the early s, but for sure human habitation predates that. In , the English captured it and it remained in English hands for the rest of that century a stone in the shoe of south-east Scotland. It was finally retaken in  by the forces of Patrick Dunbar but later it became a rebuilt stronghold of the Home family.History records that they hosted the young princess Margaret Tudor here in  as she headed north to become Scotlandrsquos queen, with her marriage to James IV and thus change the destiny of both countries.She will have shared the views we had while we ate our picnic, although I suspect her banquet may have been a little more indulgent. Who can say what impressions this wild view gave her of her new homeland.Her granddaughter, Mary Queen of Scots, would visit the castle  years later in , in what for her was a very turbulent time.How I wished the few stones of the castle that still stood could tell a story of these remarkable women, who had to navigate their royal privilege through misogynist contempt.After being abandoned, the castlersquos windswept ruins were the haunt of smugglers and wreckers, who would set a light amongst the old stones, making it look like a welcoming port.But it was the story of Madge Gordon that was foremost in my mind as I sat amongst the ruins of the castle that, according to the tale, she helped liberate from the English.The story is called the lsquoGuid We of Coldinghamrsquo and it is to be found in Wilsonrsquos Tales of the Borders. These were a fantastic collection of stories written by John Mackay Wilson in the early th century. Today, the Wilsonrsquos Tales Project promotes his work, which was prodigious.It is a tale set in the grim times of the Rough Wooing in the s, when English forces were using force and terror to persuade the Scots to agree to the marriage of the young Mary Queen of Scots to Edward Tudor.Madge was a widow with an abiding hatred of the English occupiers, who had killed her husband. Her daughter Janet was in love with a young man called Florence, but Madge would only agree to their marriagethe young man showed his loyalty and mettle by helping her to take Fast Castle, which had been occupied by English forces.This he agreed to do, and raised a force of over a hundred local people. Madge hatched a plan to attack the castle, but both she and Florence kept it secret from Janet. She feared for her loversquos le, and felt strongly that war was pointless for it mattered not who occupied the castle as the poor folk would be oppressed either way.Madge led the attack, entering the castle in the guise of being a seller of local produce, then plunging her husbandrsquos sword into a guard. The ensuing fight was short and brutal. The young Florence fought bravely and the castle was won.After this, Madge proudly agreed that the brave Florence was worthy of her daughterrsquos hand in marriage. Janet, who had heard the commotion of the fight and rushed to the scene, desperately looked for her Florence.When she saw he was alive, she rushed joyfully to him and held him in a tight embrace. He held her likewise, saying her name ldquoJanet.But this was to be his last word spoken, for his hold on her began to weaken and his legs gave way. He had been mortally wounded in the fight. Janet screamed for help and he was carried into a room in the castle, where frantic attempts to revive him were made but he was gone.Janet plunged into inconsolable grief. She blamed her mother, and the unbearable loss sent her to the grave only two years later. Her mother followed the year after, and all three rest in Coldingham kirkyard.ldquoWhat a sad story, my we said after I had finished telling it. ldquoIs it true ldquoMaybe not in the sense you mean, I said, ldquobut it is a story with real truth: how war spawns hatred and loss, and as Janet said, the poor folk lose out whoever rules the castle.On such a sunny day, it was dficult to leave this beautul place, but the kids wanted a swim and the sun was already lowering in the sky.The walk back is a hard slog up the brae, but it gives moments to rest and catch your breath while turning to view the ruins.Here, surrounded by millions of years of geology, with the view of the tumbled remains of a castle in which lives now long forgotten were lived, a whisper is heard in the wind.ldquoWhatever your woes, whatever your joys, yours is a tiny speck in time, so use it wisely and with gratitude.On that day, I think we did just that."},{"url":null,"title":"msp-column-ensuring-river-esk-remains-clean","story":"For too long now, the river has been a point of concern for many of my constituents, and I wanted to start a forum where it would bring together those who are working to clean the river, as well as those from the community with an interest in the river, so that we could all work together to find a resolution.In my view, it is important that we look at the cleanliness of the river as a whole, tackling the issues from the sewage spillages and the coal mine discharge in Midlothian, right down to the poor water quality at Fisherrow.The meeting was productive and I am looking forward to seeing progress on this matter.

It soon ran into problems.Landowners denied access, requiring a detour, putting Aberlady station half a mile from the village. NBR fought any extension past Gullane to avoid competing with their own line from Drem.Such problems delayed opening until April , , when a service of nine trains a day ran between Longniddry, which had three s, and the Haddington branch.

Keep your wall colours neutral, like white and grey, but use your curtains, bedding and cushions to inject splashes of colour.Buying new bedding and hanging a new set of curtains can cost a lot less than a few tins of paint once you factor in all the rollers and brushes yoursquoll need to buy, plus it will take less time too.Once yoursquove bought the cushions, next time yoursquore thinking about changing the colour, just buy new covers and match the size of the cushions. That means you can store the others away, pass them on to a friend or use them in another room.Donrsquot forget about artwork. You can find some really trendy prints online and IKEA is great for cheap frames too. Make sure you buy the same size prints each time, meaning you can keep the same frames. You can update the frames easily too with a cheap can of spray paint.Canrsquot afford a new carpet  Yoursquoll be amazed at what a good deep clean and adding a colourful or patterned rug can do.If your furniture is looking a bit tired, upcycle with a lick of paint and new door handles. You can pick up a tin of furniture paint from most hardware stores or online and you can buy cute, quirky doorknobs from eBay or Etsy, or even just try spray painting the existing ones.Metal accessories like curtain rods and light fittings can benefit from that spray paint too!Upcycling is a great way to keep costs low, give a much loved item a new lease of le and is good for the environment by cutting out waste.Living roomMoving on to the most used room in the house, this can be the most dficult to update as it no doubt has many uses. From the TV room to the playroom to the dining room, your living space probably needs to be more practical than anything . But you can still add some style along the way.Your sofa likely dominates the room and can be the most expensive piece in the room ndash with the exception of the TV! So replacing this often can be costly. But have you considered replacing the covers  If your sofa is in generally good condition but itrsquos looking a bit off-colour, you can buy covers that fit over the top.IKEA do a range of these covers that are made for their sofa ranges, but you can find places online that offer made to measure services. This can be more expensive, but definitely cheaper than buying a whole new sofa and are machine washable! Alternatively, adding a new throw and some scatter cushions can have the same effect.Many of the tips for the bedroom can be used in the living room too.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit, literally. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:What has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

Another friend just bluntly declares itrsquos my job so get on with it like everyone .I wonrsquot just be going anywhere. Broadcasting on BBC Radio recently I was reminded of how dferent the situation and sentiment is in some of Scotlandrsquos island communities. Understandable when NHS Western Isles are the only health board in Scotland to record zero Covid- deaths to date. Irsquom acutely aware of our safety too as Irsquom sitting by my we Jenny with our two young daughters in the back. Wersquove multiple face masks and a gooey hand gel lake decanted into ious vessels. I spend the first half hour reminding the girls of the Scottish Governmentrsquos snappy FACTS campaign. Snappy, but I still need to look up what the lsquoCrsquo stands for.First up is Loch Melfort Hotel, a real escape out on the wild and wildly beautul west coast of Argyll. The owner is a high heidjin in Visit Scotland so they should get it right. Over a physically distanced coffee with the isles of Luing, Jura and Scarba sparkling behind him Calum Ross explains: ldquoItrsquos a real balance between making sure we take all the essential public health precautions, while at the same time ensuring itrsquos still an enjoyable and rewarding experience for our guests.Reassuringly Loch Melfort do get it right. They have clear signage branded with an image of Dougal, one of the Highland Cows who grazes happily outside, oblivious to the pandemic swirling around. lsquoDougal saysrsquo signs remind us to socially distance and to use the gel dispenser as we enter the lobby. He pops up again in our room helping us to find the hotel directory online.In the restaurant staff wear visors and dispense sanitised plastic menus. I momentarily miss a crisp white linen tablecloth, but this is soon forgotten when my Argyll beef fillet topped with local langoustines sweeps in. The girls and Jenny are tucking in too. I see Dougal outside. He seems to approve. As do our fellow diners. Itrsquos good to be with strangers smiling and laughing rather than just seeing our neighbours clap awkwardly on a Thursday.Next up wersquore off on a cruise ship. The Foreign Office almost stymies us by bringing in a blanket ban on cruise travel just before we sail. Fortunately wee Red Moon is husband and we run and takes just four passengers so our nuclear family is a charter rather than a cruise.Scott and Mary welcome us aboard like old friends, just ones who donrsquot shake hands anymore. Their trim, beautully fitted out marine hotel is equipped with a flotilla of hand gel and they explain theyrsquoll clean our bathroom daily, just not our cabins. They stress the use of gel going ashore and also that we must stay away from Maryrsquos cooking space in the galley.We spend four days puttering around close to shore after deciding to avoid inhabited isles. We ramble around rugged Bernera, where once St Columba preached under a giant yew tree. It doesnrsquot look like anyone has visited since. We also take the tender ashore in an overnight anchorage at Loch arsquo Choire in Morvern. We do stumble upon locals, but they are red deer and soaring golden eagles. Just off Lismore we are graced with a sea eagle and dolphins.Then it happens. On sleepy Balnagowan we presume the islandrsquos owner is not around. We row ashore to avoid disrupting the local seal colony, who are intrigued by our landing party and send scouts over to investigate. I ramble off alone, mindful of protective nesting seabirds and there she is. The lady owner of Balnagowan. I immediately spill into apologetic mode, but she stops me in my tracks with a beaming smile saying how happy she is just to see someone. Lockdown must have been very lonely on Balnagowan.Back on land we gun east for Perthshire and the cosseted world of Gleneagles. But can you achieve world-class five-star luxury in the time of Covid- with safety precautions in and swimming pools and spas out  The answer is a resounding yes. On arrival no one seems to mind the lack of valet parking as they shimmy respectfully through the grand racing green lobby sticking to the left as signs advise. We sanitise ourselves before meeting the receptionist, whose smile beams through her mask and screen. Again these measures reassure rather than concern.The swimming pools may be off bounds, but impressively the spa has managed to re-open, offering limited virus sensitive treatments such as a face down massages. All the restaurants have re-opened. We savour the excellent Indian dishes of the Dormy , the swish new Birnam Brasserie, with its fish and meat grills, and that grand old world dame, the Strathearn.At the Strathearn theyrsquove retained the white linen tablecloths, though they politely inform us we have to look after our own napkins ndash treacherous waters for a serial napkin dropper like myself. Once we settle in we soon forget about their visors and the sommelier is just the ever helpful sommelier and the waiters just supremely friendly waiters.In lieu of swimming we do what governments on both sides of the border have been recommending ndash get outdoors. First up is gundog training, a country pursuit I never experienced growing up on a council house scheme in West Lothian, but which thrills the girls who donrsquot care about having to wear plastic gloves. Then it is on to archery, shooting and falconry as we rattle through a greatest hits of Scottish country sports. Kids are really looked after here, even more so these days as Scott Dunn have just introduced their first ever UK programme of activities this month with Covid-era staycations in mind.When Scotlandrsquos well-heeled travellers realise a foreign holiday this year is a forlorn hope, Gleneagles is ready. But not everyone can splash out on such decadence. Our last stop is just up the road. We swap fluffy robes and marble bathrooms for a converted Leyland horse truck.Camping is all the rage this summer. As the author of Cool Camping: Scotland thatrsquos great to see. If the thought of struggling up your own tent on a windy west coast beach is too much, though, glamping tempts. Alexander House offers a brace of Mongolian style yurts, which are cosy with wood burning stoves and a surprising amount of space, with a separate bathroom with stand alone baths. The decking hosts a gas bbqand a wood fired hot tub. Once we work out how not to cook ourselves itrsquos a joy.The new option at Alexander House is Juniper. This vintage Leyland horse truck has been converted into a surprisingly swish hideaway. Itrsquos like a chic urban Airbnb inside, all fresh smelling wood ling and hipster deacutecor and furnishings. It also boasts a wee kitchen and the luxury of electricity. Outside wersquove got your own wee fenced area so you can bring a dog. And two kids. Ours love the resident brace of Highland cows who are very interested in our stay. Perhaps Dougal has forewarned them.Irsquove not mentioned Covid- for a few paragraphs and thatrsquos telling. We are now Covid-era travelling veterans, just enjoying the glorious outdoors and the scenery. For the record there are gel stations at the yurts and Juniper, the welcoming couple who run it donrsquot shake hands and wersquore assured our accommodations have been scrupulously sanitised. At the end of our stay our bedding is deep cleaned off site.When we eked out of our drive it was with real anxiety after being cooped up staring at pandemic ravaged TV screens. Everywhere we went, though, we have been reassured not only by the set-up, but also by the professionalism and consistency of the staff. The only aberrations were from fellow travellers not well versed in Scotlandrsquos lockdown measures, but thatrsquos similar to the confusion you can encounter in your local supermarket. If yoursquore thinking of a staycation our message would be go. Oh, but learn the FACTS beforehand unlike me.

They clasp hands to cross the road. The pensioner watches, wondering precisely what he is feeling. The realisation comes slowly.It is the tenth week of lockdown in the new calendar that pays no heed to the day of the week or the month. The pensioner looks at the boy swing on the end of his fatherrsquos arm. The old man, who lives alone, realises he has not touched another human being for  days.Unprecedented, he mutters to himself, using the term that has infected the language with the same facility with which coronavirus has changed the lives of everyone.His family is another county, barred from visiting him. His partner is self-isolating, outwith touching distance.Unprecedented. In his  years, he cannot have gone  days without human touch. Never. The realisation intrigues him rather than depresses him. It falls into one category of the serenity prayer that he says daily. It is one of things he must accept because he cannot change it.The summit offers a view down into Glasgow. There are the high flats of the northern escarpment. The city lies some miles in their shadow. He wonders how others are dealing with the crisis.He knows he is old. But there are those older. He knows he is alone. But he knows he is not lonely, though he considers there must be many in the maw before him who are desperately so.How are others coping  What is it like to be ageing, vulnerable, alone  The thoughts vex him.I know precisely how he feels and thinks. I am that pensioner. I am the father and grandparent who watched the wee boy clutch a dadrsquos hand. I am the grateful old dodderer who stood on the hill and prayed with an unusual fervour and an even rarer selflessness that those less fortunate were being consoled by love in the time of coronavirus.IN moments of trial, and they came in a baleful consistency from March, Betty Satti would look at her husband and start to talk. It mattered not that he had died more than five years before and she was addressing a photograph.\"You do strange things when you are down,\" she says. \"I was married to him for  years. We were close. It is still hard.\"Lockdown made it harder. Betty, , walked out her front door on Wednesday for the first time since lockdown was imposed. She has the stock response of her generation to questions about how she came though such an ordeal. \"You just have to get on with it,\" she says.But how  \"I have my two sons. I couldnrsquot see them physically because I was shielding but I could talk to them. I had my friends.\"This help included Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation, a charity that has existed for  years but found its definitive moment in a time of greatest crisis. \"It is good to know somebody outside your family is thinking of you,\" Betty says. Those thoughts were matched by action.Unprecedented. The word is spoken by Richard Donald, chief executive of Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. There is no glibness to the expression. Rather, it is spoken in awe at what his organisation had faced and how it reacted.The simple figures can be succinctly put: in  days the charity delivered more than  food parcels and made  phone calls to vulnerable older adults.There was a motion commending the work in the Scottish Parliament last week. The thoughts of the recipients remain largely unheard. But the gratitude is immense. There were reports of pensioners who had not had a proper meal for three or four days. The charity moved urgently.\"We had to adapt and adapt quickly,\" says Mr Donald, who took over his role during the crisis and thus had a baptism not of fire but of some raging inferno. \"It was disarray at first,\" he says. \"How do you deal with something that has never happened before \"The charity has four main purposes: to give welfare advice, to provide a befriending service, to operate three day-care centres and to organise more than  clubs. Priorities changed quickly.\"People needed food parcels,\" says Mr Donald. \"Celtic FC Foundation got in touch and their intervention changed everything. They had the money to help is and they had the expertise too.\"The foundation is full of good people who immediately recognised the need. The food parcel programme was organised quickly and efficiently.\"The foundation, supported by the club, moved quickly to support those most in need, announcing pound, of support in April through its Football for Good Fund. That support grew through the crisis. Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation were immediately given pound, to support its work.With the initial crisis of hunger addressed, other more innovative plans took hold. More than  iPads have been distributed to those living on their own. \"We hope to raise money to provide more,\" says Mr Donald. He has he good grace to chuckle at the suggestion that is a novel way to invoke the mantra of ldquokeep taking the tablets but emphasises their importance.\"They do not only offer entertainment but a way to connect to the outside world,\" he says. A more traditional way is also employed to build a bridge between a vulnerable, shielding adult and the world beyond four walls. Volunteers call those in need.\"Some mornings I was on a downer,\" says Betty Satti. lsquoThen the phone would ring and it was Mitch, the volunteer who calls me. There would be a lsquoHow are you  Anything you are needing rsquo That lted me. It showed there were other people out there who cared. It was not just a brief call. He would talk for  minutes and I felt there was a genuine concern for what I was feeling and what I was finding dficult.\"My sons are great. But one lives in Essex and the other one lives in Fe and of course he could not travel to Glasgow. I was shielding anyway so he couldnrsquot see me. They call every day but for someone  to do so really lts you. You miss so much when you are locked down.\"I love going to the [GGG] clubs as I made so many friends there but when that became impossible it leaves a big gap in your le. The calls helped fill that as did the tablet. It sounds daft but the wee game of communal bingo on the tablet every Tuesday really raised the spirits. All that kept me going. When you are on you own, your mind wanders. You think: lsquoHow long is this going on rsquo The days become weeks, then months. It is dficult.rsquoThen it was over. \"I went out my front door on Wednesday,\" says Betty. \"My carer took me shopping and it was wonderful. I can only walk so far so she put the wheelchair in the car and we went to the shops early, when it was quiet. I was a bit hesitant.\"We take for granted being among people. But you miss it terribly, even just watching people walking about. You get depressedyou donrsquot see people. It was good to be back among people again.\"There is a pause then she adds: \"I am so grateful. I have a wonderful family but isnrsquot it great when people help you when they donrsquot have to or need to \"She adds: ldquoI have never know this. It is something I will never forget. There is pain in this but also the wonderful realisation that she was often alone but never forgotten.THE tone on the phone is as strong as the message it carries. ldquoI have come through a lot but never something quite as strange as this,rsquo says Nancy Sidwell, who approaches her th birthday with a sense of relief after the travails of the past five months.She was widowed in her thirties and had to bring up a young family of three. She is no stranger to hard times or moments that test the will or sap the physical strength of even the strongest but the coronavirus posed a dferent problem.\"It is hard to describe precisely,\" she says. \"But is a mental thing. The reality of not being able to touch anyone. Not being able to hug the ones you love. Not to have people in your house. It was a terrible sensation of being locked in not just locked down.\"She pays tribute to her family but is also grateful to Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. \"They helped provide a leline to the outside world,\" she says. \"I am used to being on my own and quite happy normally in my own company. But this was dferent. I found the tablet particularly helpful. It was a pleasant and useful distraction.\"Nancy lives in sheltered housing near the city centre and also grasped an opportunity to express her gratitude. \"I believe I am luckier than most,\" she says. \"In my block of flats there are  tenants and  of them have no one. No one. Now that is sad and it must be very dficult.\"She believes this is when Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation became not only helpful but essential. \"The people there are truly caring,\" she says. \"I tell you what I mean by this. There is a lot of talk about helping. But they made sure you were all right. They talked to you. They did something. Actions. They came along with the tablet, they called you.\"There is an uplt when you connect with the outside world. It comes when my grandchildren send me a text at night and when my children call me. Grandchildren are a godsend and you miss them dreadfully. We need that human touch.\"There is nothing that can replace that when you are distanced from those you love but those outside that circle can offer something . You need to know there is somebody out there who cares, not because you are a grandmother or a mother but simply because you are a human being.Nancy, too, found something of good to take from a period of her le that she admits caused her fear.ldquoI learned to appreciate what I had, she says. ldquoI learned to appreciate the love I received, whether it was from family, my circle of friends or from Glasgowrsquos Golden Generation. It is important to know somebody out there cares for you.The conversation ended with Nancy offering her good wishes.

But I believe schools should ldquosqueeze the brake pedal before reverting to the way things were in February. We have a golden opportunity to change our rigid education system.I donrsquot propose a complete abandonment of exams, timetables and classrooms, but I believe we have a duty to ask whether we can evolve the education system to better prepare pupils for an unknown future.Last year, our school built the UKrsquos first Innovation School, NuVu. There, pupils collaborate on developing creative solutions for real-world social and environmental problems. This supplementary method of learning challenges the Scottish Government by providing an example of how a new national curriculum could look.In March, the innovation school hatched a spinout, ViseUp, a collaboration between Kelvinside Academy and businesses across Scotland, which used the schoolrsquos D modelling software, D printers and laser cutters to provide PPE for frontline staff.For all that agility, we ndash just like every school ndash were unprepared for a pandemic. We learned valuable lessons and are still working to answer a litany of dficult questions of ourselves, our school and the entire system.Does being taught passively by a teacher in a classroom serve pupils  They are digital natives and wersquove been given a passport into their world. We must map out terrain to stay there. Especially as wersquove broken through the teething pains ndash particularly the overwhelming flood of gs during every online lesson.On Microsoft Teams, pupils have lsquopermissionrsquo to ask what they deem ldquostupid questions, away from judgment by their peers, without the formality of email. Often those questions are the gateway to true breakthroughs. How can we make sure pupils continue to feel secure enough to ask those questions in the classroom As businesses across the world debate whether or not toto the office, we will explore how we can adopt elements of blended learning which serve pupils preparing to enter a world moving away from an office-based -, with increased flexibility, and increased personal responsibility.Witnessing the pupils who have thrived during lockdown has been a wake-up call. We must make sure these pupils continue to thrive when school s. Part of this will be continuing to prioritise inidual feedback on a task by task basis, even in the cut and thrust of the classroom.Pupils have been consumed by two stories the pandemic and the social justice movement. We were able to adapt to make space to explore these issues and the level of engagement was inspiring. Can we be agile enough to always put current issues at the heart of the curriculum Finally, we must ask how we can make sure therersquos a quick and easy switch to home learningschools must close again.If educators go back to the way things were, we will fail our pupils. What will allow us to answer these questions is empathy and openness. We must be open to transformation and empathetic to pupils and teachers as we navigate our uncertain future.For all the questions and for all the debate about what pupils have lost, we are certain about what the most valuable skill pupils can have when they leave school, and itrsquos resilience.

It just happened by chance to be the cloth on my fatherrsquos old briefcase and the prince said lsquothatrsquos just what Irsquom looking for,rsquo said Sugden, who has just been announced as a textiles programme ambassador for The Princersquos Foundation.ldquoThe majority of stag horn buttons come from Austria. The prince is very open and both fastidious and passionate about craft. So he insisted that the buttons had to be Scottish stag horn. He does care about the detail. It really matters to him that he promotes British craftsndash even with the smallest of things.ldquoWe were actually both a little concerned that it would be the Austrian buttons that went on the jacket because we couldnrsquot find an alternative at the time. But the princersquos fastidious nature drove us to look into sourcing Highland stag and we went to great s to do so. Now we have a gamekeeper who makes them for us.ldquoWhy do we have to ship stag horn buttons from Austria at all that extra cost  It does not make sense. It also fits in with the princersquos philosophy about carbon footprint with the distance goods unnecessarily travel to market.The cost of the jacket and waistcoat has not been revealed, but a similar bespoke pair of the garments made by Campbellrsquos retails at around pound,.Sugden said the princersquos insistence on Scottish stag horn buttons was one important example of why it was important to promote British crafts.Through his role as an ambassador, he will use his expertise of working in the textiles industry to support the princersquos charity in its vision, mission and strategy.He is also co-chair with Patrick Grant ndash from the BBCrsquos The Great British Sewing Bee ndash of the Dumfries House textiles school in Ayrshire.The Princersquos Foundationrsquos Future Textiles programme aims to address a skills gap within the UK textiles industry by offering practical workshops and advanced training courses to school pupils, teachers and those looking to gain employment in the industry. Many of these courses are delivered in the estatersquos textile training entre, located in the old sawmill at Dumfries House where the foundation is based.Programmes range from one-day workshops for school pupils to in-depth training programmes producing garments for the luxury fashion market. Supporters of the programme including major retailers and brands such as Yoox, Net-a-Porter, Alexander McQueen and Christopher Kane.Campbellrsquos, which holds a royal warrant from the Queen, also supplies the RoyalHousehold and makes all the tweed outfits for Balmoral Estate.Over the years, the company has also supplied the Queen Mother and the Duke of Windsor. Sugden is too discreet to name other famous clients but admitted: ldquoI often see our clothes being worn by people gracing the pages of Hello, Country Le, and Harperrsquos Bazaar.ldquoI saw the movement towards craft coming. I try to push and promote British-made products. We use British cloth every time we can. We have some of the finest fabrics in the world. Fast fashion will have a downward spiral.Sugden has worked with the prince for five years. ldquoI have always had a passion for clothing and for making things in Britain ndash and so does the prince, he said.People are starting to care more about provenance. But I was struck by the lack of skills in the industry that were in danger of dying out and that it was imperative to build them up.ldquoThe problem is not really in design ndash lots of people want to be designers ndash but there is a worrying age gap in making things in such skills as cutting, tailoring and working as seamstresses. If the demand is coming back we need to make young people feel valued in the industry again.ldquoWe need people to work on the shop floor of the mills again ndash it is not like the days of Jerusalem and dark satanic mills. They are modern working spaces. A weaving job is a skilled job. We all canrsquot be designers. We have to enthuse people to be involved in the whole process. Even the skills to darn socks are being lost.Sugden recognised that the fashion industry had to do more to cut down on its environmental damage from such things as microfibres polluting the ocean.He said: ldquoWe need to drive down the use of plastic in the industry. I know its a great passion of his highness as well to get its usage down. Itrsquos a huge challenge for the fashion industry, but in the UK we are specialists in natural fibres. I would rather buy natural fibres ndash why do we need polyester  Itrsquos just the price. You have to change the psyche of young people.ldquoWhat the prince is doing at Dumfries House is amazing and leading the way in saving our traditional crafts. It is offering youngsters the opportunity and pathway to be part of the future of Britainrsquos textile industry. Without his initiative and raising awareness there is a real danger we could lose these old skills.It is not the first time the prince has publicly backed buying British. During a visit in  to the Isle of Harris distillery in the Outer Hebrides, Charles, known as Lord of the Isles, asked why its pound gin drinking glasses were made in Poland.The Isle of Harris distilleryrsquos gin is contained in distinctive bottles made in Yorkshire by specialist manufacturer Stolzle Glass Group. ldquoThey couldnrsquot do both  asked the prince. It was explained to the prince that they could not.Polish-born Peter Kwasniewski, the Tarbert-based distilleryrsquos shop manager, said afterwards:We tried in the UK to find a handmade glass that could match the pattern of our bottles.

Running the line at football matches was previously okay for him because he was a complete and utter nonentity unknown completely to the general and footballing public, but it will not be the case now.I now look forward to his public footballing appearances in the former industrial heartlands of Central Scotland decimated by the very people he venerates. However, fair play to himhe does turn out and I look forward to see his appearances at such places as Motherwell, Falkirk and Dundee. Perhaps he will hold public question and answer sessions after the matches.What he will do, though, is have football chairmen up and down the country rubbing their hands in anticipation of adding a few thousand supporters on to their gates every week. When the wider Yes movement and the grass roots football fans realise that he will continue to run the line at Scottish football matches and with thousands deprived of Yes marches to go on, attendance at Douglas Ross football matches could become a new raison drsquoecirctre for lots of Scots he could possibly single-handedly save Scottish football, filling stadiums week in week out.However much as it would be entertaining to see him continue as a football linesman I fear his bosses in London will put a block on the continuation of his refereeing career. He could, of course, ask the Scottish footballing authorities to install outdoor fridges along the touchlines thus allowing him to continue his career.Andrew J Beck, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.A QUESTION for an SNP MP to ask at Prime Ministers Questions: \"On behalf of those too young to vote last time, what measures does the UK PMs chief adviser, Baron Cummings of Barnard Castle, recommend to ensure that Vlad the Bad does not interfere with the  Holyrood election \" Im trying to explore the limits of a UK PMs power. He can make the English wear masks in supermarkets , but not make the Scots believe in Brexit. It takes Nicola Sturgeon to lock down Aberdeen. He cant get the French to help with the rubber dinghy immigration problem because no one beyond the Channel takes him seriously.

More than , have been rescued from the Channel this year. Asylum seekers should claim sanctuary in the first \"safe haven\" they enter in Europe. They do not and are therefore illegal immigrants. They are predominantly young men who will get accommodation, food and other benefits. Britain should tell France that unless they stop the immigrant flow we will ban all imports from France and suggest that British holidaymakers avoid France.The SNPs shadow minister for immigration Stuart McDonald said the rhetoric around immigration is \"toxic\" and based on \"inherent xenophobia\". Will he take some of these failed immigrants into his home Clark Cross, Linlithgow.THE lachrymal ducts of our First Minister must be working overtime at the moment as we are told she was \"in tears\" at the recent misbehaviour of a few of the Aberdeen team who had visited a pub, which activity ndash according to Nicola Sturgeon ndash \"put lives at risk \" and was even \"a matter of le and death\".Her tears, we are told, turned to fury at the reckless, uncaring attitude of these men who, by their actions, had put the wellbeing of us all at risk. Our First Minister then revealed how distraught she waswhen she reflected on the fate of thousands of our old folk who had contracted Covid- ndash then died in care homes.Heres my question: was Ms Sturgeon \"in tears\" or \"furious\" on learning ndash as all of Britain has in the last few days ndash that thousands of illegal migrants asylum-seekers are flooding into our country, having crossed the English Channel in dinghies, enabled and assisted on the last stage of the crossing by our Border Force, which does notthem to France but provides the migrants with all they need in terms of information advice to make a claim for asylum . Is she \"furious\" ndash as many Scots are ndash when she realises that these migrants have come through countriesravaged by Covid - yet are being accepted into our country with little or no check on them When shes not sobbing does our First Minister ever experience guilt or shame at having sent out her cry for \"more immigrants\" and calling anyone who expressed concern at this folly \"racist\" I doubt it. Her tear ducts may be working ndash but her conscience isnt. And yet, she gets kudos and acclaim from sections of the media for her \"competent\" and \"robust\" handling of the Covid crisis.Eight football players made her cry. What is her reaction to the news that thousands of people ndash unchecked, untraced, uncontacted, unknown ndash are entering our country  She must realise it makes a mockery of all the social distancing face-covering quarantine instructions.John McInnes, Glasgow.LEVEL WITH UShellipSO-CALLED climate change hits the news almost weekly, and in the last week there has been the claim that enough ice in Antarctica has melted to fill the Grand Canyon, with implications for sea level rise.In his UN climate speech in  President Obama said that ldquorising sea levels threaten every coast line.

It wasnrsquot stalker anthem \"Every Breath You Takersquorsquo by The Police either.The song that had Russell Brand so worried is called WAP, by Black superstar rapper Cardi B, featuring Megan Thee Stallion.Back before Brand was trying desperately to style himself as a Dalai Lama for the online age, he loved women to express their sexuality. At least, he did when that expression of sexuality involved him.In a video entitled \"WAP with Cardi B  Megan Thee Stallion: Feminist Masterpiece or Porn rsquorsquo Russell Brand tries his best to get to the bottom of all this misogyny stuff. He wants to know who is to blame and why women arenrsquot as good at feminism as he is.There is data that suggests women will only apply for a jobthey meet  per cent of the criteria whereas men applythey meet %.The fact that Russell Brand feels qualied to lecture women on feminism in a -minute monologue really brings this statistic to le.Brand dedicated more time and energy on \"the emergent polemic around the use of sexual imagery and female potencyrsquorsquo than he did on his first we Katy Perry, whom he famously asked for a orce via text message, minutes before she was due on stage to perform.Aacute la Carrie Bradshaw, Brand couldnrsquot help but wonder: \"Do women achieve equality by aspiring to and replicating the values that have been established by males rsquorsquoIn other words,female artists sing about their sexuality, dress sexy and sing provocative lyrics, arenrsquot they just as bad as men who objecty them To illustrate his point, Russell Brand used the example of Margaret Thatcher. Incidentally, I expectBrand had been challenged to name another famous woman from history, he would have had to concentrate really hard before coming up with \"the Queenrsquorsquo.Getting to the crux of his argument, he declared that Margaret Thatcher was more of a \"woman-manrsquorsquo because she was \"a very powerful personrsquorsquo but didnrsquot do much to advance womenrsquos equality. So thatrsquos one thing they have in common.He goes on to say that Thatcher didnrsquot possess \"conventional female valuesrsquorsquo. According to Brand, those values are \"nurture, care, equalityrsquorsquo. Quelle surprise.Some lefty men relish a discussion about how women are their own worst enemy in the fight for equality. If yoursquove ever been cornered by one at a party, yoursquoll know what I mean. They \"gently suggest\" thatwomen were quieter, nicer and covered up moregender inequality would magically disappear.When discussing how women should react to systemic inequality: the gender pay cap male violence against women female genital mutilation lack of representation in places of power, these men are full of ideas.When challenged on their own behaviour or activism they are not so keen to chat. They reply indignantly that they would NEVER rape a woman and then look around for somebody to present them with a \"Male Feminist\" certicate.Itrsquos no surprise that Russell Brand used the work of black women in his monologue about the oversexualisation of women.Black womenrsquos bodies are hypersexualised and black women are subject to the racist \"Jezebelrsquorsquo trope. It is very telling that Brand finds the black women who had control over their depiction of female sexuality such a cause for concern.It was all just a bit too lewd and in-your-face for the newly-conservative Russell Brand who said the music video gave him a feeling that \"wasnrsquot particularly distinct from what I would get watching more conventional erotic contentrsquorsquo.PerhapsRussell Brand spent less time watching \"erotic contentrsquorsquo and lecturing women about feminism he might have more time to look after his children.He has admitted in the past that his we does most of the parenting. Our new feminist saviour doesnrsquot often have sole charge of his children because he is \"ineptrsquorsquo and has too much of a \"romantic and reflective dispositionrsquorsquo to bother with childcare.If Russell Brand is genuinely concerned about womenrsquos inequality then a good place to start might be to change some nappies.

Thatrsquos not in any way what the SQA are doing. What they are looking at is the comparison of assessment of performance or estimation of performance with final performance.But a document outlining the approach it was takingfrom the SQA clearly contradicted this.In a portion related to the awarding of results, it said that schools and colleges would provide them with their estimates of the grades, bands and rank order for each learner, for each course at National , Higher and Advanced Higher.\"We will then check and validate that information. We will moderate it,necessary, to ensure consistency across schools and colleges and with results from previous years,\" it said.\"We will use the information from these estimates, in addition to prior learner attainment, where this is available. For example,learners achieved National  or Higher courses, in a previous year.\"We will also look at schoolsrsquo and collegesrsquo previous history of estimating and attainment in each subject and level. We may moderate these estimates, up or down,that is required.\"In further guidance it said that the moderation would \"ensure consistency across centres and fairness to candidates. This will include analyses of centresrsquo estimates and outcomes, prior attainment, progression statistics, and grade distributions.\"Scotlands biggest teaching union EIS said there was a \"bigger question\" to be asked about changing the system that \"routinely disregards\" teachers assessments.It said the current \"high stakes assessment system\" regularly fails children through operating \"notional quotas\" for the awarding of As, Bs, and Cs. It said they \"inevitably\" impact most on pupils on the cusp of achieving pass grades, the majority of whom are more likely to be from disadvantaged backgrounds\".The union believes that planning for next years exams \"on the basis of business as usual\" appeared \"woefully complacent\".It said this needs to \"be addressed urgently\" through a review.EIS general secretary Larry Flanagan said the concern surrounds that fact the SQA assessments which hit pupils in disdvantaged areas happens every year, although normally they are founded on exam results rather than teachers estimates as in this pandemic-hit year.\"Every year pupils on the cusp of passes are potentially pushed into a lower category,\"he said.\"Returning to the injustice aspect ndashteachers have classroom evidence over the course of a year which indicates pupils ability and competence at a certain level but a high stakes exam system routinely disregards that ndash is that fair \"Based on this yearrsquos outcry, most people would say not.\"Barry Black, a researcher at the University of Glasgow specialising in educational inequality, said it had been clear from the start that the SQA moderation would further disadvantage already disadvantaged young people - and said there should be a rethink for next year.\"This whole process has been one that brought about signicant levels of uncertainty,\" he said.\"It is more frustrating as it could have been avoided from the start had the SQA and Scottish Government listened to the warnings from Parliament, experts and academics from as early as April which continued through the summer.\"He said there was scope for an alternative assessment model which would have predominantly been based on the performance of the inidual pupils.A range of options open to the SQA included the collection and submission of evidence of pupilsrsquo work, which \"could have been a system that was fairer to the inidual students, rather than the system wide statistical moderation that was used\".He added: \"The changes announced earlier this week to accept all teacher estimates would not make for an ideal alternative methodthey were planned from the start, but are fairer than the methodology that was used. It will be of huge relief to the impacted young people and it is a welcome change.ldquoAn urgent review is the right thing, including looking at the role of assessment more generally, especially since we know that there is an even bigger risk of a hugely widened attainment gap in the next school year.\"An analysis from the Equality Impact Assessment, reveals that the  estimate from students in the most deprived areas was at an .% pass rate but the actual result reduced that number down to .%. A . percentage point reduction. For pupils from the richest areas, the  pass rate estimate was at .% with the actual result at .%, a . percentage point reduction.The changes announced on Tuesday mean that this years Higher pass rate will now sit at .%, up . percentage points on , while the Advanced Higher pass rate is at .%, up . points from the previous year.But Mr Swinney in apologising, continued to insist that young people from deprived backgrounds had not in fact been disadvantaged by the SQA methodology that was used.He focused on the overall pass rate which he said had increased by . per cent among pupils in the most disadvantaged communities, while it rose by . per cent among pupils in the least deprived communities.While the education secretary has apologised for what happened, the SQA has so far failed to.Mr Swinney made it clear on Tuesday that he was not criticising the SQA saying it undertook the task \"that I set and did so in good faith\" and said he was \"grateful...for the professional approach that they have taken\".The chief executive of Scotlands qualications authority Fiona Robertson insisted it had done its best to carry out the instructions of the Scottish Government.She had told Holyroods education committee on Wednesday that she was \"keenly aware of the strength of feeling\" about the results - but said it felt \"essential\" to \"maintain standards\" between dferent schools and years.She said the SQA treated teacher estimates with \"utmost respect\", but there was a \"clear and unequivocal case for some moderation\" because they were \"not always accurate\".Mr Swinney has said on Tuesday that the SQA action \"emphasised heavily the importance of maintaining standards from previous years to this year\".But he said he had changed his mind after listening to the \"heartfelt pleas\" and \"anguish\" from young people who had been affected.An independent review is to be led by Professor Mark Priestley of the University of Stirling.An initial report is expected within five weeks.A Scottish Government spokesman said. ldquoAfter listening to the concerns of young people, Ministers are clear that there was a risk of young people from working class backgrounds, and others, losing faith in the education system and the value of their hard work. That is why the Education Secretary has apologised and taken action to ensure that education can still be seen as a route out of poverty.ldquoWe have taken the decision to rely on teacher judgement as the basis for this yearrsquos qualications, but are also clear that this year is and must be seen as unique and cannot be compared to previous years and nor can it set an automatic precedent for future years.ldquoWe have already commissioned an independent review of Curriculum for Excellence, and we will work with them on extending the remit of this review to include recommendations on how to transform the Scottish approach to assessment and qualications, based on best practice globally.Barry Black analysis in fullI think there is a really interesting question in the data from results day around why professional teacher judgement - which we put so much onus on in Scotland - is seemingly at odds with the results an exam model would expect to produce. That is why a review into the role of assessment more generally is encouraging.Ideally there would be some level of moderation within any alternative assessment model.Ideally, this would have predominantly been based on the performance of the inidual pupils and not the historical attainment of pupilrsquos schools - which is where the issues we saw stemmed from, and what were warned about and against. As for next year, I think the potential for more disruption this school year needs to be considered ahead of the assessment diet. It also needs to factor in that those sitting qualications have already lost class time before the summer, and that lockdown will have almost certainly impacted upon attainment and the attainment gap signicantly.The moderation process was explicitly designed to replicate consistent results with previous exam diets, and produced wholly dferent results to the teachers estimation. Which brings about the questionwe currently assess in the best way to reflect young peoplersquos abilities.What the SQA tried to do with moderation, as they have set out, was maintain what they would describe as national standards in the assessment system this year - broadly seeking to get consistent results with previous years exam diets. That is why the predominant feature of their methodology was tolerance levels of grades at a school based on results it had achieved previously.To all intents and purposes, their moderation aimed to pattern what would happen in a normal year. But such statistical system-wide adjustments were always destined to impact more disadvantaged inidual students the most.Plainly, although exam results are socially patterned in normal years, iniduals still have control over the process - through coursework and exams. This year they clearly didnrsquot have that, and were assessed not by their inidual performance, but the past performance of their school.Thatrsquos why the interesting question around teacher judgement being seemingly at odds with what an exam diet would expect predict to happen arises."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11704186.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scots-complicit-slavery-long-act-union-says-academic","story":"Professor David Worthington, a reader in history at the University of Highlands and Islands, has been involved in researching Scotlandrsquos involvement in the slave trade pre-.He found evidence Scots were involved in several European markets in countries, including the Netherlands, that had links to South American plantations that recruited African and indigenous slaves.While recent condemnation has focused on major cities and the statues of iniduals who profited from colonialism, he says merchants from rural parts of Scotland, including the Highlands were also profiting from lucrative sugar plantations owned by slavers, decades before.: Plaques on Scotlands statues do not go far enough, says anti-racism groupHe said: ldquoItrsquos fascinating to take itback to the s, which often people donrsquot do, and to see that these entanglements have deep roots.ldquoIf we go back before the Anglo Scottish Union of  ndash which is such a feature of our lives ndash I think people would often think Scottish involvement in the slave trade would be in connection with the British Empire, which is when Scots have the chance to be involved in the overseas empire.ldquoOf course Scotland had its own empire before  with the Darien project [an unsuccessful attempt to gain wealth and influence by establishing New Caledonia, a colony on the Isthmus of Panama, in the late ] but the involvement of people in Scotland in the slave trade was not actually dependant on the Union.ldquoThere were several overseas empires which were very happy to engage in slavery and thatrsquos something that we have to consider.One of the main trade centreswas a Dutch colony in Rotterdam,says Mr Worthington but records of Scots involved at that timeare scare.: Without slavery Glasgow wouldnt exist: Thebrutal truth of Scotlands slaving pastHe said: ldquoI think theywere a bit more slippery. The numbers arenrsquot that great from the Highlands but they were exploiting the fact they were on the margins.In the period before the th century, Mr Worthington says Scots travelling abroad were more likely to go toa European country than North America, which led to imperial connections.The key industries, pre , were tobacco and sugar and it was not uncommon, he says, for Dutch merchants to trade sugar for horses, which were shipped to plantations in South America.He said: ldquoWe think of the tobacco lords of Glasgow and rightly so because they have left a massive imprint on the city but the involvement of sugar in slavery tends not to get as much attention and that was happening very early.ldquoThe whole system in the Highlands of importing sugar was distinct and I noticed when I was looking at the customs records for Inverness the majority of shipping and shipments were coming from Rotterdam.: Pheona Matovu: To abolish slavery in Scotland we need to address the structures that perpetuate itldquoThat made me think, where were they coming from to get to Rotterdam because obviously the Dutch werenrsquot growing sugar cane.ldquoThe Dutch were expanding their colonial enterprise in the th century and led me to think about the major sugar producing plantation in the Dutch colonies at that time, whichwas Suriname.

In the lowlands it was sent to sugar refineries, there were two on the Clyde and one in Edinburgh.ldquoIn the highlands it was just being taken direct from the Netherlands.ldquoIt was certainly coming into places like Glasgow and Leith in large quantities too.ldquoWe often think of the diet as being very basic in the highlands and that was probably the case but there are even references to sugar in the Western Isles at this time.\"Tea was becoming very fashionable and putting sugar in your tea was something that was marketed.ldquoIt was a prized commodity and there was a lot of crime around it.ldquoThere was a case of a guy being put to death in Inverness for stealing sugar. They were importing these liquorice products and sugar candy and bizarrely named confections.After the Act of Union, Scotland began to import its sugar from the British Empire., from areas including Barbados and the West Indies.ldquoSugar has seeped across the whole of Northern Europe by , itrsquos a part of peoplesrsquo diet and thatrsquos quite sinister in a way. You couldnrsquot describe it as addictive but itrsquos very hard to stop once you start.Mr Worthington said he hopes to travel to Suriname to fill in the gaps of his research ndash crucially, the voices of the workers who were exploited to satisfy the palates of sweet-toothed Scots.He said: ldquoOne of the things that disturbs me about doing this is that I donrsquot have the perspective of the slaves.ldquoI have not been to Suriname but I really want to and itrsquos terrible that we donrsquot have the perspective of those people who were exploited by these iniduals.\"People in Scotland were complicit in this.

Successive administrations of dferent political complexions have reached the same conclusion in respect of other subject matter.He said this need not impede the inquiry as the Government could still explain its legal position at specic points in time.However this denies the committee the all-importanttext of the Governmentrsquos arguments before the court.Mr Swinney said a court undertaking prevented ministers releasing the probe into Mr Salmond which was set aside by the Court, or any witness statements, working notes and drafts of the report used by the investigating official.Mr Swinney also said court papers used in the judicial review were now the property of the court.Finally, Mr Swinneyrepeated Ms Evansrsquos objection to the committee obtaining written and oral evidence from civil servants.He said that officials giving ldquopersonal reflections or private opinions about Government matters, rather than representing their ministers, would be ldquoentirely contrary to civil service practice and ldquonot possible under the civil service code.This sets up a key clash over whether Ms Sturgeonrsquos chief of staff, Liz Lloyd, can give evidence.The committee says she should be included among its witness, while the Government wants to block access to her, and cover her activity in a general narrative.Mr Swinney said: ldquoI must emphasise that officialsrsquo attendance is on behalf of and with the consent of Ministers, and not on an inidual or personal basis. Neither Scottish Ministers nor the Permanent Secretary of the Scottish Government have the power to set aside orsuspend the application of the Civil Service Code in Scotland. ldquoThe refusals make it more likely the MSPs will try to go around the Government and seek documents directly from the Court of Session or try to compel disclosure from ministers.Last week they warned they would ldquonot hesitate to explore all options available, a reference to the Scottish Parliamentrsquospowers to compel the disclosure of documents.The inquiry said it felt ldquofrustration and disappointment at the government sitting on swathes of evidence related to the judicial review it lost to Mr Salmond.Liberal Democrat committee member Alex Cole-Hamilton criticised the Government for its ldquoevasiveness and said witnesses must be ldquoopen and transparent.ldquoA government process that was designed to help victims of bullying and harassment failed utterly and left workers, who had already suffered, exposed and denied natural justice.\"This committee must get to the bottom of a series of events that has cost Scottish taxpayers hundreds of thousands of pounds and left the Scottish Government deeply embarrassed.ldquoThe committee has already faced challenges over securing documents and statements from persons of interest.

If, like me, your readers were hoping for cogent analysis and logical thinking they would have been disappointed.His theme is SNP grievance, but Mr Stevensonrsquos article is redolent with his own grievance that by some inexplicable paradox, support for both the SNP and independence is steadily rising while all around, all he sees is failure and despair.He berates SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford for taunting him with the mantra of ldquotoo wee, too poor, too stupid. However, he then attempts, with the aid of some dubious back of an envelope calculations, to demonstrate that Scotland is essentially bankrupt, unable to support a currency or public services and unable to achieve equivalence with countries such as Ireland or Denmark. He opines we are so economically toxic that Scotland would be shunned by the EU.Does Mr Stevenson really believe that  And,he does, is it a good reason for persisting with a -year-old Union which has left us in such penury He then recycles the tired arguments of Better Together circa . Discovering oil was an economic disaster, Scotlandrsquos deficit is the largest in Europe, we are totally dependent on the largesse of London and so on. For Mr Stevenson and those of his ilk, any thought of constitutional change can only be measured against the yardstick of his version of economics. Itrsquos all about bawbees and siller in your pocket, especiallyyoursquore a higher rate taxpayer.The answer to his paradox, of course, is not to be found in balance sheets or economic statistics. Itrsquos staring him in the face. Since  Scotland has voted decisively against Brexit and three Tory governments, yet all have been imposed by the Union. Thatrsquos where the grievance lies and thatrsquos the reason for the increasing support for the SNP and Independence.Iain Gunn, Elgin.STRUAN Stevenson states that it would ldquocost around pound billion to establish our own currency. He has, however, got it this the wrong way round.To put  billion Scots Pounds into circulation, you take in pound billion Sterling in exchange. This forms the reserve as backing for the Scots currency, although I would suggest that some of the Sterling be sold in exchange for gold and or dollars, since Sterling is a very weak currency, and the Scots pound would be stronger. The reason for this is that the UK has, for a good number of years, been running a trade deficit, usually at least pound billion annually, whereas Scotland has, since records began, always shown a balance of trade surplus, currently around pound billion a year.Older readers like me will remember the post-war mantra ldquoexport or die, the IMF bail-out when James Callaghan was Chancellor and the conditions imposedand the fall of Sterling from the post-war  to the pound to . to the pound now.Since the last world war, about  countries have become independent. Nearly all established their own currency very quickly with no fuss, little expense, and a lot of advantages.But maybe Mr Stevenson would have preferred to stay with the Titanic rather than risk a leboat.Ian Macdonald, Bearsden.STRUAN Stevenson repeats the mantra about Scotlandrsquos ldquodeficit, ignoring as usual that, whatever this figure is supposed to actually represent, it is mostly generated as a result of mismanaged fiscal powers reserved by the UK Government. The Scottish Government, allowed very limited fiscal freedoms, balances its budget every year. When was the last time the UK managed to do this  Elsewhere he refers to Scotlandrsquos Covid- death rate being higher than Norwayrsquos, a unionist deceit since, again, it was the delayed, incompetent deployment of powers reserved to the UK Government that resulted in the unnecessary deaths of our fellow Scots.These are but two typical examples of the flimsiness of the unionist cause.

This will require the Scottish Government to invest in lower emission modes of transport, including more fuel efficient ferries.“Orkney’s internal ferry service is a perfect example.

It brings together erse partners to develop the tools, processes and business models that mean rural and poorly connected communities can rapidly establish next generation and G connectivity for local benefit.Currently, only  per cent of the UK is being served by all four UK mobile network operators and there are still , homes and businesses that don’t receive adequate broadband service as investment predominantly focuses on areas with higher population density.To date, mobile connectivity in the UK has relied on mobile network operators to purchase exclusive licences for access to spectrum and they design, build, own, and operate their own networks.  In , Ofcom changed its policy on spectrum sharing to develop a more open and accessible spectrum market one that acts as a  for innovation, reducing the cost of access to high-quality spectrum in regional areas and opening opportunities for new endeavours to address rural connectivity.G New Thinking will help by providing a practical how-to guide for rural communities looking to capitalise on this opportunity and invest in local connectivity. By developing this replicable and flexible approach, the project aims to help poorly connected communities build commercially sustainable, next generation networks using G technologies.By making this guidance widely available, G New Thinking also aims to stimulate local investment in rural connectivity across the country, to close the rural digital ide. All of this is built on the learnings from trials undertaken as part of G RuralFirst, a Cisco-led DCMS G Trials and Testbed programme.Chief Executive, Cisco UK  Ireland, David Meads, said: “Our findings with G RuralFirst revealed that over a ten-year period, the UK’s rural economy could grow by an additional £ bngood quality G services were accessible.“We believe that by taking advantage of neutral hosting technologies, fixed wireless access and spectrum sharing, we will be able to allow third parties – including local businesses and communities – to build and own radio infrastructure, as well as work with mobile network operators to reduce costs and make rural coverage commercially sustainable.”Minister for Digital Infrastructure, Matt Warman, said: #We are making sure the UK#s rural communities aren’t left behind in the digital age and are investing record amounts to improve connectivity in the least connected parts of the country.“G New Thinking is part of our £ million programme to help the countryside capitalise on new ways of using next generation G technology and I look forward to seeing how rural communities will benefit.#The project is expected to go live later in  and to conclude in .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

And we need Harperrsquos Law to help fix it.ldquoI have witnessed first-hand the lenient and insufficient way in which the justice system deals with criminals who take the lives of our emergency workers.ldquoSadly nothing I do will bring Andrew back ndash but I know he would be proud of me for seeking to bring about a law change, which will hopefully act as a deterrent to anyone considering doing to one of his fellow emergency service workers the terrible thing that happened to him.ldquoHarperrsquos Law will ensure those that commit these offences arenrsquot out again on the streets in a matter of weeks while the families of the victims suffer their own le sentences. That would be far more just.Her comments come after the first anniversary of Pc Harperrsquos death on Saturday.Mrs Harper is expected to meet with her local Tory MP John Howell on Tuesday and is waiting for a date for a meeting with Home Secretary Priti Patel.The campaign is backed by the Police Federation of England and Wales, whose chairman, John Apter, said: ldquoThe killing of a police officer should see those responsible face the rest of their lives in prison.ldquoThis campaign would be Andrewrsquos legacy and we will continue to support Lissie in her efforts to seek justice and change the law for the greater good.copy -.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system.

He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges.

[see Notes to Editors for further explanation of these figures]Since July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing.Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.“Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app.“This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts.“Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.“Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful.“We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.”Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible. For further information on the virus, its symptoms and how to book a test, visit www.pha.site coronavirusWe must be aware that COVID- is still a threat and we need everyone to play their part in helping to stop the virus spreading.If you receive a positive test result you will be contacted by the PHA’s Contact Tracing Service from .Members of the public are also encouraged to download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app on Android or Apple, which complements the work of the Contact Tracing Service.

This is why I have taken this decision today, he said.“In the challenging situation in which we find ourselves, there are no perfect solutions. Students would have preferred to have taken their exams, but that was simply not possible in the circumstances. There is no substitute for exams themselves and recent events highlight the need for a full-timeto education, five days a week.Mr Weir thanked teachers and pupils for their hard work during the Covid- pandemic.Read More Gavin Williamson made A-level results U-turn after ‘concerns’ emerged at weekendThe CCEA has released a statement saying they will work as quickly as possible to confirm A level results with schools and colleges.As directed by the Minister, we will work as quickly as possible to confirm the results with schools and colleges. We will also update the information shared with UCAS   IUA, with any urgent cases prioritised. We are working through other details, including the appeals process, and will provide updates as soon as information becomes available, the statement read.The CCEA said that GCSE results will be released as scheduled on Thursday  August .The news has been welcomed across the political spectrum, however SDLP education spokesperson Daniel McCrossan said the Education Minister should now apologise to teachers and pupils for the stress the situation has caused.“While I welcome the eventual positive result, I do deeply regret the anxiety and distress this has caused for our young people over the last number of days. It was unnecessary and highly unfair, he said.The Education Minister should offer a full and genuine apology, to our young people for causing this distress and to our teachers, for the way their professional judgement was cast aside.”“The minister should compel CCEA to publish the algorithm that was used. It is critical lessons are learnt from this debacle so no student is forced to ensure this stress in the future.”Sinn Fein MLA Karen Mullan said the decision by the minister was the only sensible response to the problem. “Minister Weir should have taken the action earlier and on the merits of the arguments rather than waiting on the approach of ministers in London, she added.“The delay in changing this process has served only to compound the stress and and anxiety experienced by our students, their families and teachers. “I’m pleased that through cross-party co-operation and pressure from the Education Committee that we now have a positive outcome for our young people and that the right decision has finally been made.” Read More Students plan protest over Northern Ireland A-Level exams debacleUlster Unionist education spokesperson Robbie Butler question how long it has taken for the change to be announced.“However the question will be asked why did it have to be this way  This decision could have been made long before now, despite it being the only sensible option on the table. It`s very late in the day, he said.Students have been put through immense stress. Given that mental health is the number one issue for young people this has only piled misery upon misery. The system has failed them up until now. Now it needs to deliver. “Further questions arise such as how quickly can CCEA turn this around and get the regraded results out to the students affected  And what role are the universities going to carry out to play their part  They cannot close their eyes and ears to what is going on around them. There needs to be a collegiate approach to the solution for all students.”Earlier on Monday Peter Weir announced that GCSE results, due to be released on Thursday, will be based solely on teacher-assessed grades.The minister said he made the decision following advice from Northern Ireland#s exams board. the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessmentand having listened to the concerns of school leaders, teachers, parents and young people.Standardisation is normally a key feature of awarding qualications in Northern Ireland and across the UK, he added in a statement.“However, these are exceptional circumstances and in exceptional times truly dficult decisions are made. I am conscious that for GCSEs, unlike at A-level, we do not have system level prior performance data for this group of young people.The standardisation system used by CCEA dfers for A-levels and GCSEs. The A-level model took into account pupils# previous exam results, while the GCSE model used the past perfomance of GCSE classes in the schools the pupils attended.When questioned as to why the new system announced for GCSEs cannot be applied to A-levels, Mr Weir said there is effectively an internal market for GCSEs in Northern Ireland, while more A-levels are set by outside bodies where in the UK, so there is a need to ensure there is comparability with the rest of the UK market.“We’ve got to ensure that whatever is happening in the wider context, particularly between ourselves, England and Wales, have a level of compatibility between each other, or we’re going to be advantaging some pupils at the expense of disadvantaging others, he told the BBC.“Clearly,a national decision was taken, I would want to make sure that our pupils are not disadvantaged and therefore I think that would lead inevitably to a level of change and I think that would also result in terms of the issue of comparability between those students who are doing English board examinations and Northern Ireland board examinations.So there’s got to be a very close link between what we do in Northern Ireland and what happens particularly at an English level.Belfast Related ContentEducationCarrick mum#s anger over impact of NI exams uncertainty on childrenThe chaos of the exam results has been twice as stressful for Carrickfergus mum-of-four Gillian Brownnutt .Education PremiumJamie HarkinOpinionFarcical exercise in statistics has put our futures at stakeDid Education Minister Peter Weir and Justin Edwards, who heads up the Council for the Curriculum, Examinations and Assessment , study their model like I studied the A-level syllabus, often into the small hours every single evening EducationA-Level results: Devastated NI pupils look to appeal results decision Puplis and parents have demanded action after A-Level results left many students in limbo yesterday.EducationNI GCSEs students to be awarded grades predicted by teachersGSCE students in Northern Ireland are to be awarded the grades predicted by their teachers, Stormont’s Education Minister has announced..\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland eb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fabe-a-dfd-b-affd_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  .\"GalleryEducation PremiumNorthern Ireland exams chaos heads for the courts as MLAs face recall from summer breakThe Education Minister is facing a High Court battle over the chaos being experienced by thousands of A-level students across Northern Ireland.

The SDLP said it was a win for students but called on Mr Weir to publish the controversial algorithm which he indicated he would do.Yesterday morning the minister announced that GCSEs would be based solely on teacher predictions, but he failed to move on AS and A-levels. An SDLP motion to recall the Assembly to discuss the matter was signed by Sinn Fein, UUP, Alliance, the Greens, People Before Profit, the TUV, and independent MLAs Jim Wells, Claire Sugden, and Trevor Lunn.Teachers had been asked to give predicted grades, but then other data - including the past performances of students# schools - was used by the exams body CCEAto standardise the results.Announcing his U-turn at pm on Monday, Mr Weir said: My prime concern is to ensure that young people in Northern Ireland are in no way disadvantaged in comparison to their peers where.Portability and comparability of qualications is critical for students, particularly in Northern Ireland.In the challenging situation in which we find ourselves, there are no perfect solutions.

I am glad that the Department of Education has now accepted that it is right to place trust in teachers to grade students# A-level work.However, the question will be asked why did it have to be this way  This decision could have been made long before now. It#s very late in the day. Students have been put through immense stress. Given that mental health is the number one issue for young people this has only piled misery upon misery.Alliance MLA Chris Lyttle said: While this news is welcome, we are not through the woods just yet. The Education Minister#s delay has risked many pupils missing their university place. We now need a prompt delivery of the new grades and support for those who need it to move on in their educational career.SDLP MLA Daniel McCrossan said: This is a win for our teachers and their professional judgement, but most importantly, a win for our young people.They fought tirelessly against the flawed standardisation process and for grades that accurately reflected their ability and their work ethic.Green Party education spokesperson, Councillor Simon Lee, said: The Education Minister has made this U-turn as a result of pressure from teachers, parents and pupils. Credit to them for demanding an equitable resolution to this fiascoIt#s been a fiasco that was entirely foreseeable since problems with standardisation began to emerge with the publication of results in Scotland.

There was never a quiet moment when Jim was around.He was always there in the stands and I#m sure he yelled a word or two at me and a few of the other players, maybe not always complimentary!It#s a sad day and everyone at Coleraine FC will miss him greatly.

Now Foden plans to head to the same spot at Six Mile Water during the off-season and try his luck.Foden#s biggest catch was a lb catfish in Spain and Barry - a lelong Manchester United fan - said he would be happy to show the English U World Cup winner the best fishing spots along the Antrim river.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClosePhil Foden in action for City FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappPhil Foden in action for CityFoden may be heading here a bit sooner than he#d hoped, after City#s Champions League dreams were ended by Lyon in Saturday night#s quarter-final.It finally brought their season to an end, with the players now free to enjoy some downtime before the action resumes in September.And according to sports website The Athletic, Foden is planning to head to Antrim to fish the same spot where the record trout was caught.Meanwhile, Barry, who is a member of the Antrim District Angling Association, promised thatFoden does come to Six Mile Water, he will not wear his United shirt.It has to be me to show him about the river after my catch, Barry said. I wouldn#t wear my United top buthe brought me a City top I#d maybe wear it just because it#s him.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseBarry McGuigan with his monster catch on Six Mile Water FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBarry McGuigan with his monster catch on Six Mile WaterI wouldn#t be letting any pictures be taken because you know what football is like. I wouldn#t be changing from United.If he#s a fly-fishing man, it#s a great river to fish from. He#s maybe heard that this was a rare catch.He can give me a shout because I#ll guide him along the river.A lot of people don#t like to boast about our river because it#ll bring more people to it but I think it#s a great thing because it brings people to Antrim and it#s some good news.The Six Mile would probably be the best brown trout river in the UK.I fish in the river four nights a week. I went fishing one night last week at eight o#clock to about half-three but I didn#t get one bite.Recalling his record catch, Barry explained that wild brown trout would generally reach lb in a letime but to catch an lb specimen was a pretty special moment.Barry, who is a barber, was night fishing at his regular spot on July , with friends Rory Whiteand Neilson Wilson , when he caught the trout at am.The specimen weighed lb and was  inches in , which is a rare size and weight for a fish of its kind in its natural habitat. After posing for a photograph, Barry released it back into the water.That#s unheard of and there was one caught  years ago by a fella on a dferent river system and he has it stuffed in his living room, Barry added.This is a resident brown trout that lives in the river. It has obviously gone to Lough Neagh at some stage and has gotten bigger.There was one caught in Antrim  years ago about lb and it was in the fishing shop my whole le.My scales were a bit dodgy too, so mine may have even been bigger than lb!

A body which represents the industry, Hospitality Ulster, has told the Executive that non-food or ‘wet pubs’ have been left ‘without any hope’. A financial package from the Executive is now ‘urgently needed’ to save many businesses employing dozens of people in Derry despite hotels, restaurants, and pubs serving food operating safely since July , says Hospitality Ulster Chief Executive Colin Neill. Pubs were set to reopen on August  but a decision has now been pushed back for a number of weeks. googletag.cmd.push However, further easing of the lockdown - including the reopening of pubs - depends on the rate at which the virus is spreading in the community. Mr Neill said the Executive needs to support pubs: “Although we have an indicative date of  September, that is an eternity away and there is no guarantee that this date will even be met. “I have pressed the case for non-food pubs to be open as soon as possible, andnot, then a bespoke financial package must be delivered immediately. “The consequences of no support will mean that many jobs will be at risk, on top of those who have already been made redundant. googletag.cmd.push “We now need to take a pragmatic approach and raised with the Executive Office Ministers, a number of ways in which we can get non-food pubs open in a safe way, just like the rest of the hospitality sector.” As preparations were made to come out of lockdown in May ideas were floated such as making use of Guildhall Square and outdoor spaces in the city centre, however, those plans for the most part have not come to fruition. Derry City and Strabane District Council said it continues to meet with representatives from ious government departments and key stakeholders to proactively bring forward a number of positive initiatives aimed at assisting with the ‘safe recovery and reopening’ of the city centre. SAFE SPACES A council spokesperson said stakeholders have looked at a number of new creative and innovative ways at providing more space and a safe environment that will enhance the city centre visitor experience. She continued: “Council is very supportive of Department for Infrastructure’s desire to put measures into place within the Walled City to reduce traffic and to improve conditions for pedestrians. “We believe that this will provide assurance to the public and will assist our businesses in planning for social distancing as part of their recovery plans.” They say work is ongoing to assist with this process and to also look at how such pilot schemes could possibly be extended to Strabane and other parts of the district over time. In terms of street trading and licensing, the council is looking at ways of resolving the challenges that exist and ensuring that government guidelines and health advice are being adhered to. A temporary Pavement Cafeacute Licencing scheme has been introduced to assist hospitality retail businesses and agreed to temporarily waiver all fees associated with granting a temporary licence for a period of six months. Although pavement cafes may not be suitable for all businesses or streets, it is believed that pavement cafes may help some hospitality retail premises during the recovery phase and assist with adhering to current social distancing guidelines when they reopen. The council is currently processing  pavement cafeacute licence applications. A spokesperson added: “The council will continue to work in partnership with the department in the coming weeks to engage with businesses and the public to ensure that whatever measures are put in place are reflective of the needs of all our local stakeholders.” The council added that any changes in relation to the pedestrianisation of streets would have to be agreed by the relevant government departments and key stakeholders and in consultation with the local businesses. NEW SCHEMES The Department for Infrastructure said the minister is committed to working towards reimagining and reshaping spaces as part of an ambitious Executive recovery plan. As part of this recovery phase, there is a need to provide additional temporary pedestrian space in urban centres to accommodate social distancing. The department is working to identy where measures to re-allocate road space may be appropriate to facilitate local footway widening and social distancing. A spokesperson commented: “The department has been working closely with Derry City and Strabane District Council to devise projects in order to adapt to a new way of living, driven in part by the ongoing Covid- emergency. “Together we have already initiated a project to provide widened and pop-up cycle lanes on the Foyle Riverside in the city centre. “The department is also a member of the City Centre Economic Stakeholder Group, which is chaired by Derry City  Strabane District Council, and is focused on co-ordinating the phased and safe recovery of Derry’s city centre. “The group is exploring schemes such as footway widening, timed traffic exclusions, temporary traffic management measures and streetspace repurposing. “Further details will be announced in due course.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Is it any wonder after weeks, months and years of looking out at their peers playing in the middle of the action, many of our players will just throw in the towel. Bulging benches at U level soon subside and by the time minor level comes along, clubs can sometimes be scraping to get  and have to go dipping into the Us. Worse still, some of the star underage players dont cut the mustard at senior level. The bright lights and party scene of university becomes too appealing for some. For others, study and work will take them out of the country, never to . Some may fall out with the club and out of love with sport. googletag.cmd.push The other scenario, one that is all too common, is the man child who relies on power and when everyone  grows up, they havent the skill to offer anything more against players who have caught up in the physicality stakes. At the end of the day, in my opinion, underage is about giving the youth a purpose within a healthy lestyle and a social circle. It needs to provide players for the senior team and strive to pick up some silverware along the way. If a club can do this and win every title along the way, then even better. googletag.cmd.push In an ideal world, the club U championship would be the best barometer of success. By that point, the players have demonstrated a level of commitment to stay on board for the guts of  years and could backbone the senior team for a further . Perhaps with the GPAs new proposal for a split season, county boards will be able to properly schedule their U grade so it gets the proper slot. In recent seasons, Slaughtneil, Glen, Lavey and Magherafelt have pulled out of the competition as their main players were preparing for senior county finals. Its the younger grades that are the concern, as many coaches adopt a win at all costs attitude to their teams. I once heard an U manager talking about needing an extra session per week to prepare for a big game. The fixture in question was a Feacuteile group game. For the love of God, people need to take a step back. If you have a team talented enough to reach a final, then go all out to win it. As a general rule, dont listen to the doting parents chirping over the wire about getting the perceived strongest team out. Most of the time, they only have their sons or daughters interest in mind and not the clubs overall health  years down the tracks. All underage leagues and group games should be treated accordingly, a chance to develop. In any  of players, there will be many dferent levels of skill and physique. Any club serious about underage, will have enough helpers with their teams to cater for it. Set them targets. Condition players to work on their weak sidethey have mastered a skill. Or better still, encourage them to improve the pace of its execution and challenge them to make better decisions when in possession. For players that are struggling with a skill, thats the dficult part. That is real coaching, requiring both patience and dedication, with very little instant satisfaction. The earlier in the players coaching journey, the easier it will be. Break down the skill into manageable chunks. Where possible, link in with parents, so it can be worked on outside of training sessions. Parents have to take ownership as well. Even something as simple as video examples posted in a Whats App group. In many ways, this is where the most improvement will happen. There will be late developers, sometimes ing from other sports, but iniably those who strive to improve will always blossom. If you cant bring them all along with you, then you cant say you didnt try. At the end of the day, GAA is not for everyone. There are other sports and interests out there. The approach to games is the deal-breaker. It will dictate how many players you will retain. Managers should arm themselves with a piece of paper to plot a grid of who starts each game, how many minutesthey play and how long each substitute gets on the pitch for. Make a note of any players who have had school games that week or with the age group above. It will allow you to give more action to those who need it. All through the league, maintain a strong spine to your team so that it can always be competitive, but make some of your key players sit out some action and challenge others to play central roles in the absence of the so called star players. Better still, play them in dferent positions and tinker about as much as you can. Does anyone really care who wins an underage league or blitz game  Give others an opportunity to wear a starting jersey and watch how your grid changes. Make sure everyone gets starting in a number of games and not token five-minute appearances when the game is over. Youngsters are far from stupid. Its amazing what a jersey number below  can do for someones self esteem. It can feed into the development work you have been talking to the parents about. At the end of the day, championship is where the main focus will always be. And rightly so. A competitive edge must also be developed. If you can get a number of challenge games in and everyone gets playing, it will help maintain a bigger squad. This enables your coaching team to ide themselves up to work on dferent players and aspects of play. Take turns to be the stats person for a night to count things like use of weaker side, playing the final pass for a goal or the number of blocks. It is the perfect psychology to get inside the heads of the players in the top bracket of your squad. Also fire in wee reminders to others you see improving. In Thursdays documentary, iconic Meath midfielder Gerry McEntee referred to how Seaacuten Boylan would always have one on one chats and make him feel like he was the most important person in the world. It was a persona that made people want to improve. Mary K Burke snapped this gem of a photofrom a recent Feacuteile final. Look at the joy on the youngsters faces. Victory helps instil that type of emotion, but imagine an environment where everyone felt like that. Coaching sessions where learning overspills into laughter and where every player gets their fair share of game time. Imagine. That world would be a much better place, somewhere nobody would ever want to leave.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Dan McGrellis passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family and friends. He was a well-known and much-loved member of the community, parish and local GAA club. At his funeral, Fr McGavigan paid tribute to a ‘good father, grandfather and great grandfather’. “Dan was a remarkable man. He knew from a young age the importance of a father, losing his own father to cancer when he was only twelve,” he told mourners at St Joseph’s Church, Fincarn. googletag.cmd.push “He was the second of nine children, and took on a father’s role, moving to Scotland to work so money could be sent home for his mother and siblings. “Such instinctive sacrice and generosity, learned at a young age, was to be the mark of the man. Dan was to have very soon celebrated  years as a pioneer, the pin proudly worn on his lapel. “He was far from a shrinking violet, though, and was a regular in the pub in his youth, enjoying a game of darts with friends. The soberest, but perhaps the most sociable of all his friends. googletag.cmd.push “The parish of Banagher has lost a faithful friend who was a companion to many people work colleagues, extended family, GAA, pioneers and the community association to name but a few. “He had a huge heart and had room for everyone, so of course we are sad, even though he lived a long and incredibly full le.” Dan and the rest of the St Marys committee pictured at the opening of the new pitch in . The McGrellis family are steeped in the tradition of the club, and Dan’s seven sons wore maroon ties at his funeral in a nod to their father’s deep affection for St Mary’s. Dan was chairperson of St Mary’s GAC, Banagher from  to , having been vice chairperson in  and . As well as his involvement with the GAA, Fr McGavigan told the congregation that Dan contributed greatly to parish and community le in Banagher. “Parish and community were central to his le,” he said. “He lobbied the council for a footpath from Feeny village to the chapel, ensuring access for the local primary school, and was an early member of Feeny Community Association. “Helping to establish the parish bingo, he was involved in the renovation of the parish hall and ably served for many years as a sacristan in this church.”  Dan’s most loyal commitment, though, was to his family and his we Anne. Fr McGavigan told mourners how the couple encountered each other long before they were married. “The story is told of how he, as a young boy, watched a christening pass his mother’s shop on the way to the chapel,” he said. “The baby was a certain Anne Conway, who was brought here to be christened. “He recalled how he wasn’t much interested in a baby at eight years old, but recounted how a neighbour remarked, ‘this could be the girl you marry’. “Years later, they met again at a dance in Aghabrack and they soon married and settled down to begin a family. So began the McGrellis dynasty. “Dan and Anne patiently, generously and faithfully raised their twelve children, instilling in them their own virtues of hard work, kindness, generosity, respect and good humour.” Fr McGavigan concluded by encouraging Dan’s many children, grandchildren and great grandchildren to be inspired by his le. “Dan was a powerhouse of prayer and work and an inspiration for all of the McGrellis family,” he said “To his children, grandchildren and great grandchildren be inspired today by the holy le and death of a good man, and see in his le the virtues you would like to see in your own. “If you do this, Dan will live on in you and future generations. Woven into your sadness, there is a deep gratitude to God for all that this man has been to us. “We are happy, because we know deep down that his le was complete and that he, in the end, was ready for God.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Hopefully, on the back of this, something  might pop up,” she told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I don’t think people thought it was going to be such a big movie. Aoibhine got into it through Alison Campbell models, who put her in for it. Aoibhine with Sir Tom Courtenay. “They flew us over and set us up for four or five nights. The crew and all had been filming for about six weeks, so we were over on the second last week for her scene. “Her role is ‘Cassie’, an evacuee child. It’s a small role, but she features three or four times, so we’ll have to go to the cinema and see her.” Despite her new-found fame, mum Edele says the -year-old has remained grounded after initially filming the scenes almost two years ago. googletag.cmd.push “She’s actually a shy wee thing, a very modest wee girl. She wouldn’t tell anybody that she’s in anything,” she said. “We obviously had to get confirmation from school to let her go, so before she left, Mr Scullion at the Loup called her up in front of everyone and I think she nearly died! “She’s just taken it in her stride. She was a bit younger when we went and did it and it was amazing to see the whole set up and how it was all done.” Pictured with the films lead, Gemma Arterton. Aoibhine’s family are hoping to get together over the next few weeks to watch her on screen, but in the meantime, cinema goers may unknowingly find themselves sharing a room with a film star. “I’ll make them all aware, I’ll roar at the screen,” said Edele, who was planning on visiting the cinema at the weekend with Aoibhine and her husband, Shane. “We might be able to get it here streaming with the family next weekend,we don’t get to the cinema.” Edele says Aoibhine, who also features on a current Phoenix Gas television advertisement, didn’t have to abandon her Loughshore tone for the role. “They wanted the Northern Irish accent, so she didn’t have to change it or anything.” Summerland is in cinemas now and can also be streamed on Amazon Prime Video.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Conor Cahill, a native of Cloyne in the Rebel county, began his trip in Belfast and will make his way down Ireland’s west coast before ing along its eastern seaboard. The walk, which Conor has branded the ‘Camino d’Ireland’ is a huge personal undertaking, but his chosen charity, the Ethiopian Deaf Project , is the priority. “I’m walking anyway, sosomeone  can get the benefit of it then it’s a great story for me,” he told the County Derry Post. googletag.cmd.push “I do this because it pushes my body and resets a lot of my batteries. It’s just like hard training, the benefits are fantastic.” The EDP is a committee of voluntary fundraisers dedicated to supporting deaf children in Ethiopia gain access to formal education. They place a particular emphasis on assisting deaf children from poor rural families or those who are living isolated lives. Fundraising activities, in particular their child sponsorship program, have facilitated the development of a school that is transforming the lives of the children who attend. Miriam ORegan Miriam O’Regan, secretary and founding member of the EDP, said all donations, no matter how small, are helpful. googletag.cmd.push “The money is so hard to raise that we are extremely careful on how it is spent, we know where every cent goes,” she said. “We started my chance I suppose. Myself and my husband, Patrick have two children adopted from Ethiopia, one of whom is deaf. “We then heard of a Dublin priest, Fr. Stephen Monaghan who was trying to do something to help the deaf in Ambo. “We contacted him and said we’d like to help, maybe have a coffee morning or something, the rest is history. “We raised enough to buy land, then with matched funding from Misean Cara to build and extend the school, set up a sponsorship program to support the children and their families. “Now they come with their families once a month to learn sign language and in the next few years we are hoping to get one of the bigger organisations or group to help us establish a much needed boarding house.” Conor stayed in Dungiven while travelling through Derry. Conor feels the experience of being deaf can be a lonely one, but while staying in Dungiven, he was able to meet and talk to a deaf person from the town. “Caroline, my host, took me down to the GAA club and I started talking GAA with a few lads who were down there,” he said. “With social distancing, I was kind of sat in the corner and a deaf lad was brought over by a few of the lads. “I knew straight away he was deaf, so we were signing back and forward and it’s a lovely experience to have. “The other experience I had of that was in a place called Matera, in the south of Italy. I went into a restaurant last year and there were two people signing. “Eventually I went over and introduced myself and signed my name to them. We spent an hour and a half, between signing and texting and talking - communicating. “They told me that, over the three weeks they had travelled from Hamburg, I was the first person that had made any attempt to engage with them. “It’s a tough way to live. Three weeks on holidays and no one making any effort to communicate with them.”  Having already been to Derry City, Conor was keen to experience what rural County Derry had to offer when he was planning his trip. “I had been to Derry [City] before so I decided I didn’t want to go back through the city again, and I wanted to see rural Northern Ireland as much as I could,” he said. “It was great to come through the county and put places to the names, like Slaughtneil from the GAA side of it. “I loved the shared community spirit as that’s dferent in the north. The word ‘community’ is used a lot more. “I did have a chuckle, though, coming through some towns and seeing the signs from winning the  Tidy Towns’ award in . “When you walk Italy, you get an ancient sense of history. When you walk Ireland, our history is a more recent history.” Conor, along with the EDP, is running a ‘Guess the Steps’ competition. Entry is via donation and can be accessed on the EDP website - www.edp-ambo.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Phil Gordon, who works at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry, says the ‘milk float’ stereotype is outdated and inaccurate. “There are fantastic cars to drive. People have an image that they’re like a milk float, but they’re very powerful cars and fantastic to drive,” he said. “I’ve been saving about pound, a year since I went electric. I do about , miles a year down to Dublin and between Derry and Letterkenny regularly and it suits me perfectly. googletag.cmd.push “I could never go back to a petrol or diesel car. It’s just frustrating they’re not making it easier for more people to get on board.” While the price of EVs is higher than a standard internal combustion enginecar, Derry man Ronan McElholm says the cost of petrol or diesel often means a saving on electric cars. “There is a massive saving. People look at the price of the car and compare it to their petrol or diesel, but you have to factor in the fuel that you use,” he said. “You could easily spend pound, on diesel in three years and then there’s the service costs. The servicing of an electric car is very minimal. googletag.cmd.push “Most of your breaking is regenerative, so it recharges the batteries and brake pads have been known to last , miles on an electric car. “There isn’t as much wear on brakes or tyres, it doesn’t need serviced as much and when you go to sell it, the residual value of the car will be so much more than any combustion engine car. “People have to look at the bigger picture. I would love to see every car become electric.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland. This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent – coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe. “Maintain social distancing, wash your hands regularly, and get testedyou display any symptoms of coronavirus. You can also download the StopCOVID NI contact tracing app. “This disease has the potential to make its presence felt in any community, as we have seen with clusters appearing across a number of council districts. “Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others. That’s why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus evenyou dont have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters. Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings. “Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner. Dr Waldron added: “Speculation around current clusters of COVID- across Northern Ireland is not helpful. “We will not be commenting on inidual cases of COVID- or going into the detail of every incident that emerges, as this could lead to people being identied, create stigma and focus attention on iniduals, families or groups, and therefore deter others with symptoms coming forward to be tested.” Everyone with symptoms of coronavirus can book a free test. If anyone is concerned that they are experiencing any of the symptoms of coronavirus, they must self-isolate and arrange a test as soon as possible.

To date, that remains the only such cluster in the Causeway Coast and Glens area identied since contact tracing began on May , which is one of eleven identied across Northern Ireland. A Public Health Agencystatement revealed that Newry, Mourne and Down District Councilhad the highest number of identied clusters, while Mid and East Antrimis next highest. Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council,Ards and North Down Borough Council andArmagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council all have one identied cluster of over five people. googletag.cmd.push There have been no large clusters identied in the Derry City and Strabane or Mid Ulster districts, that cover the remainder of County Derry. However, the PHA have also said they have identied  smaller clusters, of less than five people, across Northern Ireland, and said they would continue to publish data each Thursday. A cluster is currently defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID- among iniduals associated with a key setting, with illness onset dates within a  day period. Key settings which have seen clusters to date since May include workplaces, retail or hospitality premises, domestic gatherings, and sporting settings.  googletag.cmd.push COVID- transmission risk is highest in a household setting, and it is to be anticipated that a signicant number of linked cases within households will be identied by efficient contact tracing. It is for this reason that household-linked cases are not reported as clusters. Since July, the averagenumber of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled. The PHA say the rise may be attributed to the gradual easing of lockdown measures, but may also be explained by relaxing of attitudes to social distancing. Dr Gerry Waldron, Head of Health Protection at the PHA, said: “Cases are occurring in communities across Northern Ireland.

Stendhal Festival Presents: Unlocked, due to take place in Limavady in the last week of August, would have been the first ever series of socially distant outdoor music gigs in Northern Ireland. However, after receiving advice from the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Scientic Advisor, organisers have had no choice but to cancel the event. The advice said the festival was likely to cause a signicant risk to public health. A statement from the festivals Board of Directors said they were disappointed with the decision, but that it left them with no choice. googletag.cmd.push As a result of this advice from the CMO and CSA and due to the fact that the R rate is on the rise along with the number of localised clusters and confirmed cases across Northern Ireland, we have no alternative but to make the decision to cancel all of the proposed events, a spokesperson said. From the outset we said that while we would do everything within our power to get the events approved, we would always put public health first and act on guidance provided by Government. We are disappointed for all the acts on the bill who were hoping to get back on stage doing what they do best, for the people who supported us and believed in us by purchasing tickets, for those who were to be involved in the production element of the festival, the traders and the event staff who were hoping to secure some income from the events. googletag.cmd.push We would like to thank everyone who supported us on this quest to get festivals back on the agenda post lock-down, in particular our amazing team of volunteers and our local Councillors in Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council, who made a brave decision to support our endeavours in June. We await more detailed feedback on our Risk Assessment and Event Plan from the Department of Health in the hope that further clarity can be gained on the specic threats outdoor gatherings may pose to the public. These documents can still help be a factor in getting outdoor gigs back on the agenda,not for us now, for others in the arts and music industry going forward. The organisers said refunds for tickets would be available on the website by the end of the week.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by. Miceal Rooney put Kilcoo two clear five minutes from the short whistle, while OrsquoHiggins scored a beauty right on half time to leave it - to - to Mickey Moranrsquos side.The lsquoFord got the best possible start to the second half with Conor Maginn and substitute Cathal Burns finding their range to put them ahead. It was tit for tat for the next phase of the game and with ten minutes left Kilcoo lead by one thanks to scores from Jerome Johnston, Paul Greenan and Conor Laverty.The games turning point came on the rd minute. A brilliant move involving Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Ryan Johnston and Miceal Rooney placed the ing Ceilum Doherty in and he palmed home from close range.The home side never gave in though and showed great resolve, Marc Reid even coming up to point from distance in what was a superb inidual score and one of the highlights of the game.But the Magpies held out, Doherty adding a good score to seal the three-point victory margin.Bryansford: Marc Reid , Stephen Toner, Ryan McDonald, Aaron McDonald, Timmy Hanna, Conor Maginn , Danny Savage , Fintan Canavan, Conor Devlin, Corey Laverty, Ryan OrsquoHiggins , Paddy Sheridan , Thomas McAnerney, David McKenna, Daniel McDonald.Subs used: Cathal Burns , Chris Clarke , Jack Maginn, Niall OrsquoHiggins, Lewis Casement.Cill Chua: Martin McCourt , Niall Branagan, Ryan McEvoy, Tiernan Fettes, Miceal Rooney , Darryl Branagan, Eugene Branagan, Darragh OrsquoHanlon, Paul Greenan , Shealan Johnston, Jerome Johnston , Conor Laverty , Martin Devlin , Ryan Johnston, Niall McEvoy.Subs used:Ceilum Doherty , Felim McGreevy.Referee: Neil Cousins .Bryansford -Cill Chua -ACFL DIVISION A.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick.jpg","title":"Downpatrick motorists facing further disruption  ","story":"MOTORISTS are bracing themselves for five weeks of town centre disruption in Downpatrick.Work on a pound, sewer improvement scheme starts next week, with NI Water contractors focusing on key areas.They include New Bridge Street, Church Street, Bridge Street, Saul Street, Saul Road, Marian Park, Drumlin Park, Scotch Street, Market Street, Market Lane, Stream Street, Racecourse Hill, Ardglass Road, Edward Street, Knocknashinna Road and the Knockchree Road.A number of short lane closures are expected, with two-way traffic maintained at all locations using temporary traffic controls.Vehicular access for residents and businesses will also be maintained as far as possible but there may be some slight delays according to NI Water which has confirmed that pedestrian access will be available at all times. Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

The original proposal was to end the scheme on August .Downpatrick councillors Gareth Sharvin mdash who initially proposed the free parking initiative ndash and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed the extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the decision in early August.ldquoI proposed the initiative to encourage shoppers back into Downpatrick to provide a boost for our local businesses who have continued to provide key services during the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across the district and to review the car park tarf of p an hour, with a reduction in the hourly rate being considered.Cllr Sharvin said while shoppers will not have to pay to park for almost two more weeks, he has vowed to continue working with local businesses to ensure that the local authority is doing everything it can do to support them.He added: ldquoWith this feedback from local businesses, I would not hesitate to call on the council to reconsider the car parking charges again,traders feel it is impacting on them signicantly during this continuing pandemic.Cllr Hanlon said while free parking had been extended, it was important that the public remembered that charges would be introduced shortly.However, she expressed disappointment at the lack of signs informing people that parking is free which confused some shoppers.Cllr Hanlon said a number drivers contacted her regarding the issuing of enforcement tickets whilst using the car parks for minor offences.She continued: ldquoThis, in my opinion, was counter productive to the reason why councillors had agreed to the extended free parking to encourage people to shop locally and provide businesses with some breathing space to adapt to the new way of working.She also highlighted the need for the local authority to press ahead with its car parking strategy and for an equitable charging system across the

Hanna settled into the next bunch, finding his climbing legs quickly and reached the summit in fourth place over half a minute clear of Martin Dematteis.One of the best climbers in the field, Hanna continues to hone his descending skills too and he held on for a long time on the descent in fourth before being caught by Dematteis.However, he achieved a brilliant fth place finish, taking the scalp of the Aymonod, the winner the day before, and many other top runners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 United.jpg","title":"United front in drive to restore Downe services  ","story":"HEALTH campaigners have welcomed the new united front in the campaign to restore key services to the Downe Hospital.Politicians, trade unions and the Down Community Health Committee worked alongside each other in lobbying the South Eastern Trust to restore emergency services at the Downpatrick hospital which is scheduled to happen on October .In a throwback to previous campaigns, all of the districtrsquos political parties and trade unions are now working alongside hospital campaigners to secure the future of the Downe and to argue for a range of new services.Campaigners say while they will be keeping a watching brief to ensure that the hospitalrsquos AE reopens in October as planned, they are also conscious of the ongoing province-wide review of urgent and emergency care.The review mdash commissioned by the Department of Health ndash aims to establish a new regional care model for Northern Ireland with any future proposals subject to public consultation.At a socially distanced meeting of the community health group in Killough last week, campaigners said that future proposals for the Downe arising out of the review could be crucial and potentially be the launchpad for a major new battleground.Confirmation of theof emergency services in October comes after it was revealed that over the past five years there has been a % increase in AE attendances at hospitals across Northern Ireland.Signicantly, Department of Health figures reveal that the biggest increase mdash .% mdash was at the Downe, with the number of patients increasing from , to ,.Health campaigners say the figure represents another ldquostrong, persuasive reason why they must continue to fight for a local emergency department which is valued and needed.They are delighted with the plannedof AE services, suggesting that with the fastest growing emergency department in Northern Ireland, there is a ldquostrong, logical statistical argument for not only retaining the service, but enhancing it.Health committee chairman Eamonn McGrady,revealed that analysis of increased attendances at emergency departments shows that the growth area is not Belfast, but at hospitals in the Southern , Northern , Westernand South Easternhealth trusts.He added: ldquoWe know we are not home until the Downersquos emergency department is reopened in October and and we will all be keeping a watching brief.Mrs Anne Trainor said she was ldquomore prepared than ever to work harder for the Downe as she will never be able to repay the debt of gratitude that she owes the hospital and its excellent staff for helping her ill husband.She also described a recent meeting with senior officials from the South Eastern Trust to discuss theof emergency services to the Downpatrick hospital as ldquorobust and revealed she was left perplexed when health minister Robin Swann said health officials would ldquoexplore the feasibility of reopening the department.ldquoThis particular service has been part of the Downe Hospital for years. Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district. There is strength in our unity and togetherness. Itrsquos said that lsquounited we stand, ided we fallrsquo but we have no intention of falling anytime soon..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11659217.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...I trust I made it perfectly clear that I regard Gerald Smyth as both an exemplary officer and a very brave one too. He started the war as a captain and rose to become a brevet brigadier-general.His courage is testied to by the fact that he was mentioned in despatches seven times and awarded the DSO twice .Wounded six times, he lost his left arm below the elbow as early as October while rescuing a wounded soldier under heavy shellfire. Jeremiah Mee’s career does not inspire similar admiration.Scrutiny of Jeremiah Mee’s statement to the Bureau of Military Historysuggests a leadership role which goes beyond simply acting as spokesman. It also establishes beyond doubt his treachery. Part  of the witness statement details ‘His activities at Republican HQ  -’. Father J Anthony Gaughan produced a book entitled ‘Memoirs of Constable Jeremiah Mee’ in  and is also the author of Irish Dictionary of Biography entry on Mee whom he describes as ‘leader of the Listowel RIC mutiny’. An organisation called ‘Jeremiah Mee Commemoration’ was established on  January  and is currently raising funds to commemorate Mee and describes Mee as risking ‘le and liberty to lead a Mutiny’. The prime mover in this venture is a Luke Mee.Discussion of his leadership role is essentially a red herring.Kevin Myers has done a great deal to illuminate our understanding of overlooked and neglected area of the past. Having learned so much from his work, I have no wish to comment on his alleged ‘ill-informed presumption’.Whether Mee’s account was a fabrication or an exaggeration, the point remains that Mee singled Smyth out for murder. Expressing regret at Smyth’s murder  years later in his witness statement to the Bureau of Military History does not alter the fact.Mee was a republican sympathiser who had no interest in defeating the IRA and who subsequently greatly assisted it . He had meetings with both Michael Collins and Countess Markievicz and undertook to persuade members of the RIC and the DMP to resign from their respective forces. He also assisted with the implementation of the Belfast boycott. At the very least, these considerations go a long way in seriously undermining his credibility. Therefore it is appropriate that his account be treated with the utmost caution. Much of it reads like IRA propaganda, not least his accusation that Smyth told the RIC constables at Listowel, ‘The more you shoot the better I will like you’.Was there a distinction to be drawn between Sinn Fein and the IRA in   That might prove a more interesting line of enquiry.Gordon Lucy, Belfast——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
